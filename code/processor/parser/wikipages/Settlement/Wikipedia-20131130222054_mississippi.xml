'''Winona''' is a city in [[Montgomery County, Mississippi|Montgomery County]], [[Mississippi]]. The population was 5,482 at the 2000 census. It is the [[county seat]] of [[Montgomery County, Mississippi|Montgomery County]]{{GR|6}}.
Winona is known in the local area as &quot;The Crossroads of North Mississippi&quot; due to its central location at the intersection of U.S. Interstate 55 and U.S. Highways 51 and 82.

==History==
===Middleton===
[[Middleton, Mississippi|Middleton]], Mississippi was a town that was located west of Winona's current geographical position. It is sometimes considered the predecessor to the current town, Winona.

===Winona===
{{cleanup|section|date=December 2008}}
Born as a result of the railroad being built here instead of at Middleton to the west in 1860, Winona was originally a part of Carroll County and was incorporated as a town on May 2, 1861. The first settler of the town was Colonel O.J. Moore, who arrived from Virginia in 1848. What is now the business part of town was then a cultivated field on Colonel Moore's property. The railroad passed through his property and the railway station was placed near his plantation home. An influx of settlers started after the location of the railroad and Winona became a busy town.

Captain William Witty, an early settler from North Carolina, was for years a leading Winona merchant and established the first bank in the county. Other names seen among the early settlers were: Curtis, Burton, Palmer, Spivey, Townsend, Hart, Turner and Campbell. The early businesses were mainly grocery stores.

In 1871, Montgomery County was formed from portions of Carroll and other counties, and Winona became the county seat of the newly formed county. A yellow fever epidemic struck the area in 1878, and caused many of the towns citizens to die and many to leave.

In April 1888, a great fire destroyed almost the entire business section of the town. Forty of the 50 businesses burned.

==Economy==
Winona has recently received water and power across [[I-55]] which has allowed more businesses, such as Pilot, to develop. Due to the late development of water and power across [[I-55]], Winona has until now been hindered in its ability to grow. {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

===Pilot Anchoring===
In May 2011, the economy of Winona got a slight boost with the incoming of [[Pilot Travel Centers]]. The company, a small truckstop/travelcenter chain, purchased the High Point truck and travel center, previously owned by NFL player [[Kent Hull]], for a reported $4.6 million. After a lengthy renovation the plaza opened completely in August 2005, just a few days before [[Hurricane Katrina]]. {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

===Civil rights related violence===
{{Disputed-section|date=December 2008}}
Civil rights and anti-segregationist activists, including [[Fannie Lou Hamer]] stopped to eat in Winona on their way to [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], South Carolina.  On June 9, 1963, Hamer was on her way back from Charleston, South Carolina with other activists from a literacy workshop. Stopping in Winona, Mississippi, the group was arrested on a false charge and jailed by white policemen. Once in jail, Hamer and her colleagues were, per orders of local law officers, beaten savagely by inmates of the Montgomery County jail, almost to the point of death.

While touring the country, [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] made a stop in Winona during which he was ambushed by the local barber, Ryan Lynch, an outspoken white supremacist. Lynch rushed Dr. King with the razor from his shop, but King was saved by his assigned bodyguard – a local police officer named Garrit Howard. Howard stopped Lynch without even using his firearm, but rather by quickly grabbing the phonebook from a nearby phone booth and striking Lynch in the face as he charged.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

==Hurricane Katrina and Duryea Adopt-A-Town==
In September 2005, [[Hurricane Katrina]] struck Collins. As most aid agencies were concentrating on major metropolitan areas such as [[New Orleans]], small towns like Collins were seemingly overlooked. [[Duryea, Pennsylvania]], which had experienced similar flooding as the result of [[Hurricane Agnes]] in 1972, sought a town similar in size and demographics to &quot;adopt&quot; and help rebuild after the devastation wrought by the largest natural disaster in the history of the town. By hosting a bazaar and through other various fundraising efforts, Duryea helped rebuild. Collins Mayor V.O. Smith and his wife, Ada, flew to Duryea to thank their mayor Keith Moss, organizer Trina Moss and the townspeople of Duryea. This led to a bond between the two towns and has included several visits to both towns. {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

'''Gautier''' is a city in [[Jackson County, Mississippi]], along the [[Gulf of Mexico]] west of [[Pascagoula, Mississippi|Pascagoula]]. It is part of the [[Pascagoula, Mississippi]] [[Pascagoula metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]]. The population was 18,572 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. In 2002, Gautier annexed land nearly doubling its population to 18,413 by 2010, according to the ''Gautier Comprehensive Plan 2030''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gulfcoastplan.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/2030-Gautier-Comprehensive-Plan.pdf City of Gautier Comprehensive Plan 2030], City of Gautier Planning Commission (2009), pages 3, 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Locally, the name is pronounced as &quot;GO-chay.&quot; Descendants of the Gautier family, for whom it was named, still live in the area.

Gautier is a bedroom resort community with two championship golf courses, stately homes, and historic properties surrounded by bayous and wetlands on three sides. The natural environment of Gautier offers many opportunities for recreation and eco-tourism. Due to an abundance of vacant land for development and recent growth trends along the coastal areas, the city's population is expected to increase at a steady rate during the coming years to an estimated 22,788 people by  2025.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gulfcoastplan.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/2030-Gautier-Comprehensive-Plan.pdf City of Gautier Comprehensive Plan 2030], City of Gautier Planning Comission (2009), pages 25.&lt;/ref&gt; The Gulf Coast region, of which Gautier is a part, has been considered a relatively high growth area of the State; however, the loss of houses and jobs after Hurricane Katrina led to outmigration in 2006.

==Organizational structure==
The governmental structure of the City of Gautier is relatively young but the area has deep connections to the history of the gulf coast region. The City Manager-Council organizational structure has governed since 1987. Although the 2005 natural disaster slowed growth momentarily, the population of Gautier is expected to grow at a steady rate during the coming decades. The socio-economic demographics of the city is similar to that of Jackson County in terms of income, age, gender and education, although Gautier has a higher rate of college-educated persons. The income and employment of residents benefits greatly from the proximity of strong employment centers in Jackson County.

==History==
The spacious [[Homestead Act|homestead]] Fernando Upton Gautier {{who?|date=February 2013}} established in 1867,&lt;ref name=OSArch&gt;&quot;Ocean Springs Archives by Ray L. Bellande&quot; (2006) web: [http://www.oceanspringsarchives.com/GulfHills.htm OS-Archives]&lt;/ref&gt; at the mouth of the Pascagoula River Basin still stands. He established a lucrative sawmill business in the area, and the town grew up from it. Today the town is known for its stately homes nestled between centuries-old live oaks and two championship golf courses. The home, known by locals as &quot;The Old Place&quot;, is owned by the descendants of Fernando Upton Gautier (1822–1891) and Theresa Fayard Gautier (1828–1911);&lt;ref name=OSArch/&gt; and is used for private and public events.

==Education==
The City of Gautier is served by the [[Pascagoula School District]]. The main secondary school in Gautier is [[Gautier High School]], whose doors opened in 1996 and was awarded [[Blue Ribbon Schools Program|blue ribbon]] status by the [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]] in 2005.  The town is also served by Gautier Middle School, Singing River Academy, and three [[elementary schools]].

The Jackson County Campus of Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College is located in Gautier, as one of four campuses of the [[community colleges in the united states|community college]].

==Hurricane Katrina==
On August 29, 2005 Gautier was one of many cities affected by [[Hurricane Katrina]]. Many of the coastal homes were either destroyed or flooded. Some of the houses along the coast were built on hills, leaving them with wind damage only. Homes built on the water were completely destroyed, occasionally leaving an intact slab. In a few cases the slabs were cracked in half. One home in particular was built on pylons 13&amp;nbsp;feet (4 m) above sea level and had the floor ripped out from underneath. Most of northern Gautier, above the railroad tracks, had some wind damage but largely remains intact. Despite the damages caused by Hurricane Katrina, the historic home of Fernando Upton Gautier remains intact and open for business.

===Economic Development Post Katrina===
The Gulf Opportunity Zone Act (Go-Zone), passed by Congress and signed into law in
December 2005, provided economic development incentives within the forty-nine most
damaged counties of Mississippi and other states affected by Hurricane Katrina, Rita and
Wilma. Incentives included $4.9 billion in tax-exempt private activity bonds, $106 million in
Low Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC) and a fifty percent (50%) bonus-depreciation for
property placed in service before the pre-determined deadline. Go Zone tax-exempt private
activity bonds encouraged both economic recovery and growth in South Mississippi. Some of
the largest employers on the Coast including Chevron, Northrop Grumman and PSL-North
America received recovery assistance through the increased bond allocation.
The Mississippi Department of Employment Security (MDES) was awarded a $95 million
National Emergency Grant (NEG) from the federal government to assist in temporary recovery
jobs and to help provide job training. MDES has continued to partner with organizations to
increase employment opportunities along the Coast using Workforce Investment Network, Job
Centers, partnerships and grants to community colleges and proprietary schools.

'''Okolona''' is a city in and one of the [[county seat]]s of [[Chickasaw County, Mississippi|Chickasaw County]], [[Mississippi]], [[United States]].{{GR|6}} The population was 2,692 at the [[United States Census, 2010|2010 census]].

==Geography==
Okolona is located at {{coord|34|0|21|N|88|45|2|W|type:city}} (34.0057, -88.7506){{GR|1}}.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|6.4|sqmi|km2}}, of which, {{convert|6.3|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and {{convert|0.04|sqmi|km2}} of it (0.31%) is water.

The community is at the junction of [[U.S. Route 45]] (Church Street) and State Highway 32 (Monroe Avenue).

== History ==
Okolona began its development as the settlement of Rose Hill in 1845, but it was later discovered that another location had this name. When a post office was located there in 1850, it is reported by the Okolona Area Chamber of Commerce that the postmaster of nearby Aberdeen Colonel Josiah N. Walton remembered an encounter with a Chickasaw warrior while traveling in the area years earlier. The man's name had been Oka-laua meaning peaceful, yellow, or blue water. Walton renamed the town Okolona in honor of Okalaua .

Due to the destruction brought to the area by the Civil War, few structures from this early period remain. However, the Elliot Donaldson House, constructed in 1850 and added to the National Register in 1980, as well as a handful of other homes, has survived.

In the mid nineteenth century, Okolona and the surrounding Black Prairie sometimes called the Black Belt or Prairie Belt, became what has been called the &quot;Bread Basket of the Confederacy.&quot; The area was part of the original Cotton Belt of Mississippi well before the more famous Delta region gained fame and notoriety for major cotton production.

The Mobile and Ohio Railroad completed its tracks though Okolona in 1859 making the town a center for the ginning of cotton and its shipment to markets. The town grew along Main Street as a result of the railroad; however, virtually all commercial buildings from this period, including the depot were burned during the Civil War.

Five skirmishes or battles between Union and Confederate forces occurred in and around Okolona, the most famous of which occurred in February, 1864. In a running cavalry clash between Confederate General [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]] and Union General Sooy Smith, the Federals were defeated just north and west of town. General Forrest's brother, Jeffery, was killed in the engagement.  The [[Battle of Okolona]] was fought nearby in 1864.

==Demographics==
As of the [[census]] of 2000, there are 3,056 people, 1,177 households, and 786 families residing in the city. The [[population density]] is 481.8 people per square mile (186.1/km²).

==History==
In 1805, the [[Choctaw]] Indian Agency, headed by Silas Dinsmore, was located in what is now known as Ridgeland. There is also a neighborhood called Dinsmor in Ridgeland.  The structure was then called Turner Brashear's Stand until about 1850.  It was adapted for use as a hotel named the King's Inn.  King's Inn was used as a headquarters by [[Stephen D. Lee|General Stephen Lee]] during the [[American Civil War]].  Afterward, it was operated again as a hotel until 1896, when it was destroyed by fire.

In 1853, James B. Yellowley founded the community of Yellowley's Crossing (later named Jessamine after his wife). Edward Treakle and Gordon Nichols, two real estate developers from [[Chicago]], purchased the land from Yellowley and established Highland Colony. They created plans for a town to be named Ridgeland and launched an advertising campaign to entice people from the northern United States to move south. Agriculture was the community's dominant revenue source, with pears and strawberries as the leading crops grown for sale.

==Education==
Ridgeland is served by the [[Madison County School District (Mississippi)|Madison County School District]], and has two private schools.

Ridgeland has a campus of [[Holmes Community College]].

Rideland is home of the Baptist Children's Village, which provides short-term and long-term care for abandoned, neglected, or abused children and counseling to broken families. Since 2004, the executive director has been [[Rory Lee]], a former college president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baptistchildrensvillage.com/about_staff.asp|title=Dr. Rory Lee|publisher=baptistchildrensvillage.com|accessdate=July 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Purvis''' is a city in [[Lamar County, Mississippi|Lamar County]], [[Mississippi]]. It is part of the [[Hattiesburg metropolitan area|Hattiesburg, Mississippi Metropolitan Statistical Area]]. The population was 2,164 at the 2000 census. It is the [[county seat]] of [[Lamar County, Mississippi|Lamar County]]{{GR|6}}. The Town of Purvis was incorporated on February 25, 1888 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Lamar County Heritage by Leonard Slade|publisher= Gateway Press Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was founded by and named after Thomas Melville Purves, originally of [[Marion County, Alabama]]. Purves, born March 8, 1820, was a second generation Scottish-American; his grandfather emigrated to [[Charleston, South Carolina]] in 1765.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://familytreemaker.genealogy.com/users/m/o/r/Melody-A-Morgan/BOOK-0001/0002-0001.html|title=Genealogy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Purves acquired a land grant in 1870 for a parcel of real estate which was located, at that time, in [[Marion County, Mississippi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?uri=full=3100001~!315668!0#focus|title=Art Inventories.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1871, Purves moved from his home in [[Greene County, Mississippi|Greene County]] and homesteaded the {{convert|160|acre|km2}}, along with his wife, Dorothy Abney, born May 14, 1826 in [[Hinds County, Mississippi|Hinds County]], and their five surviving children, to the rural property. Dorothy, also known as Dollie or Dolly, was a doctor who tended the sick of the area and delivered babies. Purves built a two room [[log cabin]] for his family with an open fireplace in one room used for cooking and heating. John, Thomas Purves’ third surviving child, was the town’s first Mayor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~mslamar/wpa/formation1wpa.html|title=Rootsweb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:ThomasPurves.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Bust of Purvis' Founder, Thomas Melvill Purves, sculpted by W.N. Beckwith in 1989. See Historic Purvis Depot to left.]]

Thomas and Dorothy's children were:
*	Joseph Abney Purvis (born 10/28/1845, died 1865, Jasper County, MS on the way home from the Civil War from measles). 
*	Sarah Elizabeth Purvis (born 12/18/1847, died 10/28/90, Purvis); married Andrew J. Clark (born c. 1850, died c. 1890).
*	John Boardman Purvis (born 4/2/1850, died 1/15/1921, Purvis); married Nancy Baxter (born c. 1850, died c. 1940).
*	Oliver Searcy Purvis (born 6/12/1852, died 4/22/1927, Purvis, MS).
*	Susan Margaret Purvis (born 10/26/1853, died 6/27/1930, Purvis, MS); married Plummer Ladner (born c. 1850, died c. 1925).
*	Martha Catherine Purvis (born 11/18/1862, died 11/15/1948, Purvis, MS); married Henry W. Fillingame (born c. 1850,  died c. 1930).
*	Infant Purvis born about 1850, died about 1860.
*	Infant Purvis born about 1850.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://familytreemaker.genealogy.com/users/m/o/r/Melody-A-Morgan/BOOK-0001/0002-0003.html|title=Purvis family genealogy|date=November 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1884, the [[New Orleans and Northeastern Railroad]] gained right-of-way on Purves' property and a [[Train station|depot]] was erected, along with a marker, reading “Purvis”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?uri=full=3100001~!315668!0#focus|title=Art Inventories- History of Bust}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were various recognized spellings of Scottish [[Clan]] [[Purves (Family Name)]] with the two names previously listed being only a few of many. Purves eventually changed the spelling of his surname to match the town’s depot marker which you can see evidenced on his tombstone located in Fillingame Cemetery in Purvis. Purves built and ran the first [[boarding house]] for the men who were working on laying rails for the [[New Orleans and Northeastern Railroad]]. This building was called a “section house” because that is what a house built for [[railroad]] crew was termed at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~mslamar/wpa/formation1wpa.html|title=Rootsweb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mrs. Anna Bufkin was a member of one of the first families to live in the section house as her husband was one that helped grade and build that part of the railroad in Purvis. There were around fifty men in the crew working in that area and the water supply was inadequate for that many additional people. They found a second source of water from a spring across the railroad track that was originally used by Thomas Purves (Grandpa Purvis) years before the town sprang into existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Lamar County Heritage by Leonard Slade|publisher=Gateway Press Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lamar became a county on February 19, 1904 in House Bill 166 and was formed from the second Judicial District of [[Marion County, Mississippi|Marion County]]. The county was named after [[Lucius Quintus Cincinnatus Lamar II]], who was elected to Mississippi Congress in 1872 and has one county each in [[Mississippi]], [[Alabama]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] named after him. The town of Purvis was designated as the county seat of the county Lamar with the depot of the [[New Orleans and Northeastern Railroad]] listed as the town's center and the lines to run with the cardinal points of the compass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Lamar County Heritage by Leonard Slade|publisher=Gateway Press Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Purvis began as a [[sawmill]] town and is noted to be located on the highest point on the Southern Railroad between Meridian and New Orleans by James Bounds, land surveyor, MS REG # L.S.1021.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Lamar County Heritage by Leonard Slade|publisher= Gateway Press Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first homesteaders of the area farmed and would only have to make 2-3 trips to “town” for supplies a year. The best route and the trading post most used was the [[Pass Christian]] trading post, some ninety miles south of the area which took eleven days in ox-cart to travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~mslamar/wpa/formation1wpa.html|title=Rootsweb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Mr. James Bounds, surveyor, stated:&lt;blockquote&gt;“It may be of interest to note the location of the old Pass Christian Road on a map of Stone and Pearl River Counties. This road was used very much by the early settlers of Lamar County to travel south to the coast for supplies. This road followed a natural divide between the water-sheds of Wolf River and Big Black Creek, of which the head waters originate in Lamar County. This road was one of necessity. It crossed no branches or streams of any kind and was one of the main roads of travel until modern means of transportation came into use after the [[American Civil War]].”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Lamar County Heritage by Leonard Slade|publisher=Gateway Press Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When the town was in its infancy, [[lumber]] companies bought large tracts of virgin [[pine]] forested land and erected sawmills at sites along the newly developing rail line. Thus the town was born. A special meeting of the [[board of supervisors]] was held in January 1905, for the purpose of giving a contract for a new courthouse to be built for the sum of $43,516 to [[P.H. Weathers]] (architect) of [[Jackson, Mississippi]]. This two-story brick and stone building was to replace the frame courthouse that in use at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~mslamar/wpa/formation1wpa.html|title=Rootsweb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new [[Lamar County, Mississippi|Lamar County]] Courthouse was completed in 1905 at a cost of $50,000 only to be damaged by the [[1908 Dixie tornado outbreak]], then subsequently demolished by fire in 1934. The building was reconstructed and expanded in 1956 but has fallen into disrepair in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mississippi Supervisor|date=October 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lamar County Administrator Chuck Bennett stated on December 30, 2008 that the courthouse is slated for a complete renovation that could cost up to 44,000,000 million and could take up to four years to complete. Preliminary work began in 2006 and some items have already been paid-in-full, such as engineering services and an asbestos study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/government/government-bodies-offices-regional/11909809-1.html|title=All Business.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
Purvis is located at {{coord|31|8|33|N|89|24|28|W|type:city}} (31.142616, -89.407724){{GR|1}}.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|3.9|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|3.9|sqmi|km2}} is land and 0.25% is water. Because of a well-known system of aquifers and sand mines, this area was selected for &quot;project dribble&quot; to be the site of nuclear tests by the US government during 1961 to 1968 to measure seismic activity.

===Climate===

Purvis is located in the [[Deep South]], in a [[humid subtropical]] area of the country with hot summers and mild winters. Located in USDA Hardiness [[Hardiness zone|Zone 8]], the climate supports a large variety of foliage and plants. Purvis receives about 62&amp;nbsp;inches of rain annually, January being the wettest month averaging {{convert|6.63|in|mm}}, which provides for the lush growth of native plants and trees. January is also the coldest month of the year with an average temperature of 60 degrees during the daytime and 36 degrees at night.

Summers are long with 80 degree temperatures beginning in May or sometimes sooner and lasting normally until the first weeks of October. Night temperatures do not usually vary greatly from daytime temperatures, usually dropping only 21 -24 degrees. Heat indexes can soar during the summer months due to high humidity and long hours of sunshine, causing a 93 degree day to feel as if it were 101 degrees. Afternoon showers and [[thunderstorms]] are to be expected during summer months but are often short lived. July is, on average, the hottest month of the year at 92 degrees, without counting the varying [[heat index]].

Snowfall is rare and when it does occur it usually is only {{convert|3|in|mm}} or less. Purvis averages freezing temperatures only a few times a winter. The record high was in 1951 at 106 degrees and the record low in 1985 at 4 degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weather.com|title=Weather.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Noteworthy Facts==
===Military Contributions===
[[Image:PurvisCityPark.jpg|right|thumb|Marker dedicating the Purvis City Park to those who served in World War II.]]
The citizens of Purvis have contributed greatly to the various branches of the [[United States Military]] beginning long before the town was incorporated. The War Memorial located on the grounds of the Old Lamar County Courthouse holds testament of the sacrifices the families of the area have made. The Purvis City Park is dedicated to the men and women who served in [[World War II]] and one of the main thoroughfares through the city is named in honor of one of its decorated servicemen.

===Tornadoes of 1908===
[[Image:TornadoMarker.jpg|right|thumb|Marker placed by the State to remember the Tornado of 1908, located in front of the Purvis Public Library.]]

On Friday, April 24, 1908, three F4 (207-260&amp;nbsp;mph) tornadoes left a line of destruction from [[Livingston Parish, Louisiana]] northeast to [[Wayne County, Mississippi|Wayne County]]. This line of storms left 143 people dead with 83 dead in Purvis alone. From the reports of Dr. H.R. Hermesch, Assistant [[Surgeon]] [[U.S. Navy]] and the Relief Committee at Purvis, we know that there were 83 dead, 340 wounded and 1935 destitute in the town of Purvis. The large “Town Clock” in the domed tower of the Courthouse of the time, sustained damage from flying debris and was stopped at 2:13 in the afternoon. {{cn|date=November 2013}}

An excerpt from the booklet “The Purvis Tornado” by the Lamar County Historical Society, 2004:

“The first thought was of Hattiesburg for help. All the wires were down, and they could not telegraph this city for help, so Sheriff George W. Holleman saddled his horse and W.B. Alsworth mounted the steed, and started across the country for Richburg, 10 miles distance toward [[Hattiesburg, Mississippi|Hattiesburg]]. Mr. Alsworth urged the horse for all he was worth, dashing three veritable creeks, and over rough roads. He made the trip in less than fifty minutes. A second messenger was sent behind Mr. Alsworth, so that if anything happened, the other man might reach the goal and send the news. The other messenger was J.C. Calhoun. Both men reached Richburg about 3 o’clock, Mr. Alsworth sometime ahead of Mr. Calhoun.

Alsworth wired direct over the telephone to Mayor J.D. Donald, asking for physicians to come to the relief of the stricken town.

Mayor Donald immediately made the fact known in the city. A special train over the North Eastern was the result. Thus the new of the terrible disaster was communicated to the outside world.”

[[Image:Tornado1908Back.jpg|right|thumb|Back of the Centennial Tornado Marker, placed by the Lamar County Historical Society on the grounds of the Old Lamar County Courthouse.]]

The depot of the [[New Orleans and Northeastern Railroad]], which was responsible for the success of the bustling, growing town, was one of the first public buildings demolished by the twisters and was thrown across the tracks. Railroad cars standing in front of the [[Train station|depot]] were carried away by the winds. Over 115 businesses, buildings and homes were completely demolished or partially destroyed and the entire African-American section of town was wiped out. The Purvis High School graduating Class of 1908’s commencement exercises were due to start the night the [[tornado]] hit and part of the exercises had been previously performed the morning of the tornado. The morning exercises were completed at the two story brick schoolhouse on Mitchell Street just one hour before the storm hit and had it lasted one hour longer, the death toll would have been far greater for the entire second floor of the schoolhouse was removed by the twister.

===Hurricanes===

Purvis has felt the winds of quite a few tropical systems over the years; especially considering how many miles from the [[Mississippi Gulf Coast]] the city is located. Category 5 [[Hurricane Ethel]] came in 1960 but died down to a tropical storm by the time she had reached the area. [[Hurricane Hilda]] in 1964 was not a Category 4 but an extratropical low when she deposited rain in Lamar County. Due to the close proximity of [[Lamar County, Mississippi|Lamar County]] to [[Louisiana]], [[Hurricane Betsy]] in 1965 also left Purvis some rain. The eye of [[Hurricane Camille]] came directly over Lamar County in 1969 and was the largest, costliest and most deadly hurricane to hit the Mississippi Gulf Coast until the monster storm Katrina in 2005. [[Hurricane Edith (1971)|Hurricane Edith]] came in 1971, followed by [[Hurricane Carmen]] in 1974 that drenched us with {{convert|7|in|mm}} of rain before heading off to Texas. [[Hurricane Bob]] made an appearance in 1979 but was quickly forgotten when [[Hurricane Elena]] made her way over the area in 1985 as a Category 3 storm. That same year, Purvis received more rain than wind from Category 1 [[Hurricane Juan]]. [[Hurricane Florence (1988)|Hurricane Florence]] passed by in 1988, leaving only rain as a weakening Category 1 storm. In 1992, [[Hurricane Andrew]] had thankfully died down from its original Category 5 when it came over and dropped {{convert|5|in|mm}} of rain. [[Hurricane Georges]] gave Purvis 5–7&amp;nbsp;inches of precipitation in 1998, and also some wind before curving back over Alabama. [[Hurricane Allison]] oddly stayed together long enough to still have an eye like feature over Purvis after traveling from Texas and Louisiana in 2001 and dumped 10–15&amp;nbsp;inches of rain on [[Lamar County, Mississippi|Lamar County]].

[[Mississippi]] felt the effects of The Hurricane in 2005, [[Hurricane Katrina]], which hit the area as a weakening Category 2 hurricane after reaching Category 5 strength in the Gulf of Mexico. This storm killed 1836 people, 238 of them in Mississippi. The effects from this hurricane can still be seen four years later in the forests around Purvis. [[Hurricane Gustav]] passed a little south of the area in 2008 but was close enough to leave wind and rain in its wake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wikipedia.org|title=Wikipedia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1960's Vela Uniform/Project Dribble Nuclear Tests ===

[[Vela Uniform]] was an element of [[Project Vela]] conducted jointly by the [[United States Department of Energy]] (DOE) and the [[Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (ARPA).  Its purpose was to develop [[seismic]] methods for detecting [[underground nuclear testing]].

The Project Dribble program involved two nuclear detonations called Salmon and Sterling that were conducted within Tatum Salt Dome southwest of the [[Hattiesburg]]/Purvis area in the late 60's.

The Sterling Event was the fourth nuclear detonation involved in a study, identified as Project Dribble, sponsored by the Department of Defense's Advanced Research Project Agency. Project Dribble involves the recording and identification of seismic signals from underground detonations. These studies are part of a seismic research program called Vela Uniform which is designed to improve the United States' capability to detect, identify, and locate underground nuclear detonations.

Project Dribble's purpose was to give U.S. scientists experience in detecting underground nuclear tests in the [[Soviet Union]]. The first blast, a 5.3 kiloton bomb, took place in 1964 at the bottom of a {{convert|2710|ft|m|adj=on}} shaft {{convert|28|mi|km}} southwest of Hattiesburg and four miles (6&amp;nbsp;km) northeast of [[Baxterville]]. The second bomb, much smaller, was exploded two years later within the cavity created by the first blast.

'''Marks''' is a city in [[Quitman County, Mississippi|Quitman County]], [[Mississippi]]. As of the [[United States Census, 2000|2000 census]], the city population was 1,551. It is the [[county seat]] of [[Quitman County, Mississippi|Quitman County]]{{GR|6}}. Marks was named for Leopold Marks, a Jewish immigrant trader of the late 19th century whose market became one of the earliest centers of business in the area.{{cn|date=September 2011}}

==Geography==
Marks is located at {{coord|34|15|18|N|90|16|22|W|type:city}} (34.254918, -90.272784){{GR|1}}.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|1.0|sqmi|km2}}, all land.

==History==
Marks is notable for being the starting point of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr's [[Poor People's Campaign]] in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;http://poorpeoplescampaignppc.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

The town of Marks was named after Leopold Marks (1851-1910) who left [[Germany]] to avoid conscription by the German army. He landed in New York in 1868. He knew no English and arrived with only $0.27 in his pockets. 

Nonetheless, Marks was Quitman County's first representative to the state legislature and served in that capacity for eight years. In 1875 he married; his wife, Pauline, was born in 1852 but her year of death is unknown. 

Leopold Marks realized the potential of the Coldwater River region and the dense forests and the fertile banks of Cassidy's Bayou when he bought a small trading boat and peddled goods up and down the river area. He opened his store and began to buy land at $0.40 per acre. He also peddled jewelry across the county until he reached [[Friars Point, Mississippi|Friars Point]].

Prejudice at first kept him from obtaining the land grant that he sought. He was shot at several times. (Source:  page 77-78 &quot;Jews of Early Mississippi&quot; published by University Press of Mississippi) He skirted the issue by forming the Marks Townsite Company and did manage to get the grant.  

He encouraged the Yazoo and Mississippi Valley Railroad to come into the area by giving the railroad company, without cost, the right-of-way through his plantation plus {{convert|10|acre|m2}} of land. Leopold Marks' son Henry donated land to the town to be used as a cemetery.

The official &quot;founding&quot; of the town is considered to be May 12, 1907; on May 12, 2007, the town celebrated its centennial.

'''Shaw''' is a city in [[Bolivar County, Mississippi|Bolivar]] and [[Sunflower County, Mississippi|Sunflower]] counties, [[Mississippi]], in the [[Mississippi Delta]] region. The name was derived from an old Indian tribe northeast of this region. The population was 2,312 at the [[United States Census, 2000|2000 census]].

==History==
On June 30, 1914, Jack Farmer, an African-American resident of Shaw, was being sought by a white posse for allegedly murdering Earl Chase, a white man, and also a resident of Shaw. Two deaths took place during the intense search: Jennie Collins, an African-American woman thought to have assisted Farmer in his flight, and James Jolly, a member of the posse who was mistaken for Farmer in the darkness.  Both were shot and killed as the posse swept through a local swamp where Farmer was believed to be hiding.  Farmer was never located.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

Shaw gained national attention in 1971 when a group of local residents led by Andrew Hawkins sued the town for violating their ''[[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]'' right to equal protection under the law.  In ''Hawkins vs Shaw'', the residents claimed the town had discriminated against black neighborhoods in the way it distributed public services, noting that while 99 percent of homes occupied by whites had access to sewers, only 80 percent of black-occupied homes had sewer access.  Water pressure was also lower in black neighborhoods.  The Fifth Circuit Court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, and ordered Shaw to equalize access to public services such as fire hydrants, water mains, lighting, sewers and street paving.  The ruling was considered a watershed civil rights victory, with some commentators comparing it to ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]''.  However, the case did not encourage a wave of similar lawsuits in other jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;

==History==
* [[Theodore G. Bilbo]], [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]], was born in Juniper Grove, an eastern township of Poplarville in 1877.

* [[Larkin I. Smith]] was born in Poplarville in June 1944. In August 1989, Smith died in a plane crash just 7 months after taking office in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] and was succeeded by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Gene Taylor (Mississippi)|Gene Taylor]] who would hold that office until his defeat by [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Steven Palazzo]] in the 2010 midterm elections. Smith served capacities in both the Harrison and Pearl River County Sheriff's Departments and as Sheriff of Harrison County before being elected to the [[U.S. Congress]].

* On the night of April 24, 1959, [[Mack Charles Parker]], an African-American accused of rape, was abducted from the [[Pearl River County]] jail in Poplarville by a mob and shot to death.  His body was found in the [[Pearl River (Mississippi-Louisiana)|Pearl River]] 10 days later.  The [[FBI]] investigated and even obtained confessions from some of the eight suspects.  However, the county prosecutor refused to present evidence to a state grand jury and a federal grand jury refused to indict.  The case focused national attention on the persistence of [[lynching]] in the [[Southern United States|South]] and helped accelerate the [[American Civil Rights Movement]].

* On August 29, 2005, [[Hurricane Katrina]] inflicted heavy damage on the small town. The storm's most powerful, unofficially recorded gust of wind was reported at [[Pearl River Community College]], at {{convert|135|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}.

* On September 2, 2005, the 1st Battalion, 134th Field Artillery (Ohio Army National Guard) arrived at the National Guard armory in Poplarville to assist the community and Pearl River County in recovery efforts in the wake of Hurricane Katrina.  Initial efforts were the security of banks, pharmacies and gas stations as well as initial responses to rural emergencies.  The unit stayed for three weeks ultimately checking on every family and structure in the county.

* On September 5, 2005, Poplarville played host to a visit by [[George W. Bush]], [[Laura Bush]], and Governor [[Haley Barbour]]. The politicians visited [[Pearl River Community College]] in the [[Effect of Hurricane Katrina on Mississippi|aftermath of Hurricane Katrina]].

* On December 21, 2006, an early morning fire destroyed 3 downtown buildings.

* On August 4, 2010, Pearl River Community College Soccer team pulled off a massive signing bringing in the first Scotsman at the college Curtis Sangbarani who had been an up-and-coming professionl in Scotland, he will go down as one of the best players to ever play in the State.

==History==
Grenada was formed in 1836 via the union of the two adjacent towns (separated by the present-day Line Street) of Pittsburg and Tulahoma, founded respectively by [[Franklin Plummer]] and [[Hiram Runnels]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Project&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Federal Writers' Project|title=Mississippi: A Guide to the Magnolia State|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Nb2ME6mgsAsC&amp;pg=PA383|accessdate=24 July 2012|publisher=US History Publishers|isbn=978-1-60354-023-0|page=383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:South Main Street Grenada.jpg|thumb|200px|left|South Main Street, Grenada]]

The city was formerly home to [[Grenada College]], a [[Methodist]] junior college for women.  The college was founded in 1851 as the Yalobusha Baptist Female Institute, and was taken over by the Methodists in 1882.&lt;ref name=&quot;Project&quot;/&gt;  In 1936, financial troubles led the church to close the college and transfer its assets to [[Millsaps College]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hathorn&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=J.

In December, 1862, [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] general [[Earl Van Dorn]], whose troops had been encamped in Grenada, led the three brigades under his command in an attempt to destroy the Union supply depot at [[Holly Springs, Mississippi]].&lt;ref name=&quot;HeidlerHeidler2002&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=David Stephen Heidler|author2=Jeanne T.

In 1966, [[James_Meredith#Education_and_activism|James Meredith's march]] passed through Grenada.  The town officials appeared quite cooperative, protecting the marchers and hiring six black registrars, who registered one thousand black citizens to vote.  However, after the march passed through, the registrars were fired and it turned out that the thousand citizens had never been entered onto the rolls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Robert Analavage|date=August 1966|publisher=The Southern Patriot|title=Which way in Grenada}} reprinted in {{cite book|author=Clayborne Carson et al.|title=Reporting Civil Rights: American journalism, 1963-1973|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=E8HtAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=22 July 2012|year=2003|publisher=Library of America|pages=516–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The marchers, including [[Martin Luther King]] and [[Dick Gregory]], spent about a week demonstrating in Grenada before moving on.&lt;ref name=&quot;Publishing1998&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Society of Former Special Agents of the FBI|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8h406aDUeL4C&amp;pg=PA65|accessdate=23 July 2012|date=15 June 1998|publisher=Turner Publishing Company|isbn=978-1-56311-473-1|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966 and 1967, the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] ran a [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–1968)|civil rights]] organizing project in Grenada which lasted at least 11 months.&lt;ref name=&quot;Garrow2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=David Garrow|title=Bearing the Cross: Martin Luther King, Jr., and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=HecWJnClV3wC&amp;pg=PA563|accessdate=23 July 2012|date=6 January 2004|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-056692-0|page=563}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Chartered as a town on March 12, 1803, Port Gibson is Mississippi's third-oldest European-American settlement, being occupied in 1729 by French colonists, as it was then within French-claimed territory, ''[[La Louisiane]]''.

The now defunct [[Port Gibson Female College]] was founded here in 1843.  One of its buildings now serves as the city hall.&lt;ref name=&quot;BlackBarnwell2002&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Patti Carr Black|author2=Marion Barnwell|title=Touring Literary Mississippi|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0KeMcsq5fgEC&amp;pg=PA179|accessdate=19 August 2012|year=2002|publisher=Univ. Press of Mississippi|isbn=978-1-57806-368-0|page=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Port Gibson was the site of several clashes during the [[American Civil War]] and figured in [[Ulysses S. Grant]]'s [[Vicksburg Campaign]]. The [[Battle of Port Gibson]] occurred on May 1, 1863, and resulted in the deaths of over 200 [[Union Army|Union]] and [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] soldiers. The battle was a turning point in the Confederates' ability to hold Mississippi and defend against an [[amphibious attack]].

Port Gibson has many historic buildings, including the [[Windsor Ruins]], which have been shown in several motion pictures. Many of the town's historic buildings survived the Civil War because Grant proclaimed the city to be &quot;too beautiful to burn.&quot;  These words appear on the town's city limits signs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hendrickson | first = Paul | title = Sons of Mississippi | publisher = [[Alfred A. Knopf]] | year = 2003 | place = New York | isbn = 0-375-40461-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Port Gibson no longer has a Jewish community, it boasts the only [[Moorish Revival]] building in Mississippi and the oldest [[synagogue]] in the state, the ''[[Gemiluth Chessed]]'' synagogue, built in 1892.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/29/us/small-town-south-clings-to-jewish-history.html | publisher = [[New York Times]] | title = Small-Town South Clings to Jewish History | author = Peter Applebome | date = 29 September 1991 | accessdate = 1 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Starkville area has been inhabited for over 2100 years. Artifacts in the form of clay pot fragments and artwork dating from that time period have been found east of Starkville at the Herman Mound and Village site, a National Historic Register site. The modern early settlement of the Starkville area was started after the Choctaw inhabitants of [[Oktibbeha County]] surrendered their claims to land in the area in the [[Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek]] in 1830. White settlers were drawn to the Starkville area because of two large springs. A mill southwest of town provided [[Clapboard (architecture)|clapboards]] which gave the town its original name, Boardtown. In 1835, Boardtown was established as the county seat of [[Oktibbeha County]] and its name was changed to Starkville in honor of [[Revolutionary War]] hero [[General John Stark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.starkville.org/tourism/history/timeline.html| title=Starkville's History| accessdate=2006-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Cotton District''' is a community located in Starkville, Mississippi and was the first [[new urbanism]] development in the world.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}  It was founded by [[Dan Camp]], who is the developer, owner and property manager of much of the area.
[[Image:Then Cotton District.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Cotton District at Sunset]]
The Cotton District has elements of Greek Revival mixed with Classical or Victorian. Many of these ideas came from Camp’s own travels to Europe and even parts of the United States, like Charleston and New Orleans.  The Cotton District is a walkable neighborhood that contains many restaurants and bars in addition to thousands of unique residential units, many which are filled by college students and young professionals.

New Urbanist architect and co-founder of the Congress for the New Urbanism [[Andres Duany]] has visited Starkville on multiple occasions to observe Camp and get ideas from his innovative development.  &quot;He's the most interesting story in the U.S.,&quot; Duany was quoted as saying in a 1994 issue of ''Builder'' magazine, the magazine of the National Association of Home Builders.

The area is home to the annual Cotton District Arts Festival which now boasts as many as 20,000 attendants each year.  It also hosts the annual Bulldog Bash, which draws over 30,000 people for the festival's free concerts and has featured artists such as Third Eye Blind, Gavin Degraw, The Avett Brothers, Eric Church, Sister Hazel, Howie Day, Will Hoge and Edwin McCain among others.

Oct.20, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entertainment attractions==
Mendenhall had a [[movie theatre]] called the Star Theatre, built by Edgar French, Ben Slay and Lonnie Burnham. Located on Main Street, the building boasted a 1 screen auditorium complete with balcony. It also featured a pool hall and three offices upstairs, one of which housed the city's Chamber of Commerce.

The Star Theatre opened for business on November 9, 1938 with the western, ''Born to the West.''The price of admission was 11 cents and a box of popcorn was a dime. A man from Prentiss was initially hired to run the theatre, but he was soon &quot;sent packing&quot; and Edgar French informed his son, George Lewis French, that &quot;You're taking over that picture show.&quot; Lewis French, who had worked in his father's ice plant growing up and was trained as a bookkeeper at Clarks Commercial College in Jackson, had no experience in running a movie theatre. He went to New Orleans to learn how to book movies and run the projection equipment. Aside from time spent serving in Europe as a radio man during WWII, French continued to operate the Star Theatre until he decided to close it in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;''An Oral History with George Lewis French'',conducted on May 3, 2003. Interviewer: Joe White. Mississippi Oral History Program of The University of Southern Mississippi Simpson County Project&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 1960s, the Star Theatre had problems with vandalism and growing racial tensions among its young patrons as black customers were required to sit in the balcony. In October 1979, a newly remodeled and fully integrated Star Theatre reopened under the ownership of a young local entrepreneur, Danny Collins. Its first movie was the Chuck Norris classic ''A Force of One''. The theatre once more enjoyed great popularity until competition from video arcades and cable TV forced Collins to close some three years later.

The Star Theatre was repainted once more to be used as a location for the film ''My Dog Skip''. Heavy rains caused the roof to collapse in April 2008. The theatre's current condition is unusable.

'''Iuka''' is a city in [[Tishomingo County, Mississippi|Tishomingo County]], [[Mississippi]]. The population was 3,059 at the 2000 census. It is the [[county seat]] of [[Tishomingo County, Mississippi|Tishomingo County]]{{GR|6}}. [[Woodall Mountain]], the highest point in Mississippi, is located just south of Iuka.

== History ==
[[File:Iukaearly1900s.jpg|thumb|Downtown Iuka in the early 1900s.]]
Iuka is built on the site of a [[Chickasaw]] Indian village that is thought to have been subordinate to the settlement at Underwood Village. The name &quot;Iuka&quot; comes from the name of one of the chieftains of the village.

Euro-American settlers arrived with the [[Memphis and Charleston Railroad]] in 1857. Before the [[American Civil War]], the town boasted an all-female college, a boys' military academy, and a fine hotel. The Civil War brought widespread devastation when a major engagement here occurred on September 19, 1862. The [[Battle of Iuka]] resulted in 1200 to 1500 killed or wounded. The dead [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] soldiers were buried in a long trench that eventually became Shady Grove Cemetery.

The first [[normal school]] built in the former Confederacy after the Civil War, [[Iuka Normal Institute]], was built here. However, the town did not return to prosperity for many years. The building of [[Pickwick Landing Dam]] and [[Pickwick Lake]] by the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] brought activity back to the town.

In 1904, water from Iuka's mineral springs won first prize for the purest and best mineral water at the [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition|World's Fair]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]].

==Geography==

'''Hollandale''' is a city in [[Washington County, Mississippi|Washington County]], [[Mississippi]], [[United States]]. The population was 3,437 at the 2000 census.

[[Deer Creek (Mississippi)|Deer Creek]] flows through Hollandale, and the [[Leroy Percy State Park]] is west of the city along [[Mississippi Highway 12]].  The [[Hollandale Municipal Airport]] is northeast of the city.

In a 2008 study by the University of North Carolina, Hollandale was described as &quot;a small community that has been mired in poverty for decades.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lambe&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Lambe | first = Will | title = Small Towns, Big Ideas | publisher = School of Government, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill | date = Dec. 2008 | url = http://www.iog.unc.edu/programs/cednc/stbi/pdfs/stbi_final.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Hollandale was incorporated in 1890, and almost completely destroyed by fire in 1904.{{cn|date=September 2013}}

A one-room school house in Hollandale was founded by Emory Peter &quot;E.P.&quot; Simmons in 1891.  One of the first schools for African-American children in the area, it was used until 1923, when financial support from the [[Rosenwald Fund]] enabled the construction of a larger brick school.

'''Ellisville''' is a city in [[Jones County, Mississippi|Jones County]], [[Mississippi]]. The population was 4,448 at the time of the 2010 census.

==History==
The city is named for [[Powhatan Ellis]], a former [[U.S. Senator]] for Mississippi and descendant of Chief [[Powhatan]], father of [[Pocahontas]]. Ellisville was the major commercial and population center of [[Jones County, Mississippi|Jones County]] until being supplanted by nearby [[Laurel, Mississippi|Laurel]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. 

During the [[American Civil War]], Ellisville and Jones County was a center of pro-Union resistance. Though there were many anti-secession movements and actions throughout the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], the &quot;Free and Sovereign State of Jones&quot; (or sometimes &quot;[[Kingdom of Jones]]&quot;) had from the very beginning posed the most serious and persistent threat, and even went as far as drafting its own constitution. Irregulars formed the [[Knight Company]] and were led by Captain [[Newton Knight]], First Lieutenant [[Jasper Collins]], and Second Lieutenant [[William Wesley Sumrall]]. Along with as many as 100 other southern men, they fought several skirmishes with Confederate units sent to crush the rebellion. Referenced in [[Ken Burns]]' monumental documentary [[The Civil War (documentary)|The Civil War]]; Knight's rebellion was also dramatized in the 1948 motion picture [[Tap Roots]] (based on the book of the same name), where in a few exterior scenes there are prominent mountains in the background – which do not exist in Mississippi.

Erected in 1839, the courthouse was enlarged and modernized in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Amite Repairs Court House | publisher = [[Woodville Republican]] | date = May 2, 1936 | url = http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=afskAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=chEGAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=liberty-mississippi&amp;pg=4566%2C1422037}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Amite County, Mississippi|National Register of Historic Places]].

The [[Amite Female Seminary]] (also known as the 'Little Red Schoolhouse'), built in 1853, was a girls finishing school located in Liberty.  During the Civil War, in 1863, Federal troops burned the school, but spared the school's music building.  The Federal commander permitted musical instruments to be removed, and was prepared to give the order to torch the building, when he recognized the music school's director, Rev. Milton Shirk, as a former classmate from New York.  The two-story, two-room music building survives to this day, and is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Amite County, Mississippi|National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Anders | first = Billy | title = Give me Liberty, or Give Me...Cloudcroft!!! | publisher = Southern Herald | date = Jan. 25, 2008 | url = http://news.google.comnewspapers?id=QkQlAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=XBUGAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=liberty-mississippi&amp;pg=436%2C2487435}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination Form | publisher = U.S. Dept. of the Interior | year = 1980 | url = http://www.apps.mdah.ms.gov/nom/prop/2763.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Raymond''' is a city in [[Hinds County, Mississippi|Hinds County]], [[Mississippi]]. As of the [[2000 United States Census|2000 census]], the city population was 1,664. Raymond is one of two [[county seat]]s of Hinds County (along with [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]]) and is the home of the main campus of [[Hinds Community College]].

Raymond is part of the Jackson [[Jackson, Mississippi metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]].

==History==
In 1829, three commissioners, including John B. Peyton, were appointed by [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Andrew Jackson]] to find a place near the center of [[Hinds County, Mississippi|Hinds County]] for the county seat. The current location of Raymond is a ridge about a mile from the center of the county, and was selected because the center was low and subject to flooding. The town of Raymond received its charter from the [[Mississippi]] [[legislature]] on December 15, 1830. Because of its status as a seat of justice and its proximity to the [[Natchez Trace]], Raymond developed quickly into a prosperous small town whose prosperity and smallness have remained constant to this day.

In the late 1840s, Cooper's Well, a property near Raymond with a well that provided sulphured water, was developed into a resort for those seeking the perceived health benefits from its ingestion.

Construction of a new courthouse was begun at the center of the town square in 1857 and completed in 1859, and was facilitated largely by slave labor. The courthouse is still in use as a secondary location of county legal matters (the city of Jackson having become the primary county seat) and the Raymond courthouse is considered by many {{who|date=March 2012}} to be a prime example of southern [[Greek Revival architecture]].

The [[Battle of Raymond]] was fought by [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] and Union soldiers near Raymond on May 12, 1863 as part of [[General]] [[Ulysses S. Grant]]'s [[Vicksburg Campaign]] during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Four days later, the pivotal [[Battle of Champion Hill]] was won by Grant's troops and sealed the fate of [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]]. Grant stayed at Waverly, the plantation of John B. Peyton, and Union soldiers used St. Mark's Episcopal Church as a hospital. Blood stains can still be seen on the church's floor today.

Construction of a water tower was begun in 1903 in the center of the town square and it remains a key identifying structure of Raymond along with the courthouse.

A small agricultural high school was opened in 1917 which eventually became [[Hinds Community College]], a prominent [[community college]] in Mississippi.

==Where the Southern Crosses the Yellow Dog==
A historic plaque in Moorhead is located where the [[Southern Railway (U.S.)|Southern Railroad]] once crossed the [[Yazoo Delta Railroad]] (known as the &quot;Yellow Dog&quot;). The Southern travelled east-west, and later became the [[Columbus and Greenville Railway]], while the Yellow Dog travelled north-south, and later became the [[Yazoo and Mississippi Valley Railroad]]. The level junction (diamond) is still preserved as an historic site, though the north-south line has since been abandoned through Moorehead. This railroad crossing is very significant in the history of blues music. It is widely believed that [[W. C. Handy]], after hearing an old man singing about &quot;where the Southern cross the Yellow Dog&quot;, was moved by the sound and began what came to be known as the &quot;blues&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Hazlehurst''' is a city in and the [[county seat]] of [[Copiah County, Mississippi|Copiah County]], [[Mississippi]], [[United States]],{{GR|6}} located about 30 miles south of the state capital [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]] along [[Interstate 55]]. The population was 4,400 at the 2000 census. It is part of the Jackson [[Jackson, Mississippi metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]].

==History==
Hazlehurst originated as the town of Gallatin when two lawyers and brothers-in-law named Walters and Saunders arrived from [[Gallatin, Tennessee]] in 1819, and built their homes on the banks of the Bayou Pierre in the western part of Copiah County. Other settlers came with them and in 1829 the state legislature incorporated the town. The incorporation charter was repealed on January 18, 1862. Hazlehurst began with the building of the [[New Orleans, Jackson and Great Northern Railroad]] on November 3, 1865. The town was named for George Hazlehurst, an engineer for the new railroad. There is also a city in Georgia with George Hazlehurst's namesake (see [[Hazlehurst, Georgia.]])

As Hazlehurst grew, Gallatin declined into a settlement at a crossroads. In April, 1872, the legislature ordered the county board of supervisors to hold an election to decide whether the county seat should be moved from Gallatin to Hazlehurst. A majority voted for the change and Gallatin's old brick courthouse was torn down and reassembled in Hazlehurst. Several years later, a new courthouse replaced this building after it was ravaged by fire. The courthouse has been destroyed and rebuilt over 15 times during the town's history.

Moses Marx was the first town merchant, and A. Mangold, who arrived as a newsboy on the first train, later opened a store that became one of the largest in the county. The Merchants and Planters Bank opened in 1882, with Major R. W. Millsaps as president and I. N. Ellis as first cashier.

==Local businesses and economy==
Today Hazlehurst is a thriving town.
It has many restaurants and shopping centers including:
Starks, a steakhouse that serves what are locally known as good hamburgers, and
local variations of franchises including, [[KFC]], [[Wendy's]], [[Sonic Drive-In]], [[Pizza Hut]], Bumpers, and McDonalds.

In 2009 Hazlehurst welcomed a [[Walmart]] super center.

'''Greenville''' is a city in [[Washington County, Mississippi|Washington County]], [[Mississippi]], [[United States]]. The population was 34,400 at the 2010 census.  It is the [[county seat]] of Washington County.{{GR|6}}

== History ==
Greenville was founded in 1824 by William W. Blanton, who filed for land from the United States government who granted him section four, township eighteen, range eight west.  This plot is now most of downtown Greenville.

The current city of Greenville is the third in the State to bear the name. The first, located down near Natchez, died aborning right after the American Revolution. The second is the parent city to the present one. It was named by its founders for General [[Nathanael Greene]], beloved friend of [[George Washington]], for whom the county was named. This second city was located three miles from the present site, where today stands Greenville’s Industrial fill.  The second town was a thriving hamlet in the days before the Civil War. It formed the business and cultural center for the large cotton plantations that surrounded it. The town was destroyed during the siege of Vicksburg when troops from a Union gunboat landed, and when fired upon, burned every building. The inhabitants took refuge in plantation homes of the area. When the war ended, veterans of Mississippi regiments found Greenville in a state of ruin.

For a time these men rested, but not for long. They had been defeated in battle but not in spirit. They met in twos and threes and finally en-mass and decided to build again. The place chosen was the highest point on the Mississippi River between the towns of Vicksburg and Memphis. It belonged to the Roach and Blanton families; the major part of the area selected was on the property owned by Mrs. Harriet Blanton Theobald. She welcomed the idea of a new Greenville and gave land for schools and churches and public buildings, earning the name of the “Mother of Greenville”. Major Richard O’Hea, who planned the fortifications at Vicksburg, was hired to lay out the new town.

Greenville is named after [[American Revolutionary War]] hero [[Nathanael Greene]].

==History==
[[File:Isaiah Thornton Montgomery House, West Main Street, Mound Bayou (Bolivar County, Mississippi).jpg|thumb|right|Isaiah Thornton Montgomery House is one of three sites in Mound Bayou listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Bolivar County, Mississippi|National Register of Historic Places]]]]
Mound Bayou traces its origin to people from the community of [[Davis Bend]], Mississippi. The latter was started in the 1820s by the planter Joseph E. Davis (brother of former Confederate president [[Jefferson Davis]]), who intended to create a model slave community on his plantation. Davis was influenced by the utopian ideas of [[Robert Owen]]. He encouraged self-leadership in the slave community, provided a higher standard of nutrition and health and dental care, and allowed slaves to become merchants. In the aftermath of the [[American Civil War]], Davis Bend became an autonomous free community when Davis sold his property to  former slave [[Ben Montgomery|Benjamin Montgomery]], who had run a store and been a prominent leader at Davis Bend.  The prolonged agricultural depression, falling cotton prices and white hostility in the region contributed to the economic failure of Davis Bend.

[[Isaiah Montgomery|Isaiah T. Montgomery]] led the founding of Mound Bayou in 1887 in wilderness in northwest Mississippi.  The bottomlands of the Delta were a relatively undeveloped frontier, and blacks had a chance to clear land and acquire ownership in such frontier areas. By 1900 two-thirds of the owners of land in the bottomlands were black farmers. With high debt and continuing agricultural problems, most of them lost their land and by 1920 were sharecroppers. As cotton prices fell, the town suffered a severe economic decline in the 1920s and 1930s.

Shortly after a fire destroyed much of the business district, Mound Bayou began to revive in 1942 after the opening of the [[Taborian Hospital]] by the [[International Order of Twelve Knights and Daughters of Tabor]], a fraternal organization. For more than two decades, under its Chief Grand Mentor, Perry M. Smith, the hospital provided low-cost health care to thousands of blacks in the Mississippi Delta. The chief surgeon was Dr. [[T.R.M. Howard]] who eventually became one of the wealthiest blacks in the state. Howard owned a plantation of more than one thousand acres (4&amp;nbsp;km²), home-construction firm, small zoo and built the first swimming pool for blacks in Mississippi. In 1952, [[Medgar Evers]] moved to Mound Bayou to sell insurance for Howard's Magnolia Mutual Life Insurance Company. Howard introduced Evers to civil rights activism through the [[Regional Council of Negro Leadership]] which organized a boycott against service stations which refused to provide restrooms for blacks. The RCNL's annual rallies in Mound Bayou between 1952 and 1955 drew crowds of ten thousand or more.   During the trial of [[Emmett Till]]'s alleged killers, black reporters and witnesses stayed in Howard's Mound Bayou home, and Howard gave them an armed escort to the court house in Sumner.

Author [[Michael Premo]] wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;Mound Bayou was an oasis in turbulent times. While the rest of Mississippi was violently segregated, inside the city there were no racial codes... At a time when blacks faced repercussions as severe as death for registering to vote, Mound Bayou residents were casting ballots in every election. The city has a proud history of credit unions, insurance companies, a hospital, five newspapers, and a variety of businesses owned, operated, and patronized by black residents. Mound Bayou is a crowning achievement in the struggle for self-determination and economic empowerment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Education==

From its earliest years, Mound Bayou was marked by an inadequate infrastructure for public education. According to a 1915 report in the Cincinnati ''Labor Advocate,'' Mound Bayou's school was attended by more than 300 students, who were forced to make use of equipment held to be &quot;inadequate for 50 pupils.&quot;&lt;ref name=CLA&gt;[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn88077379/1915-07-17/ed-1/seq-2/ &quot;Hustling Town of Negroes Only Built in Mississippi,&quot;] ''Labor Advocate'' [Cincinnati, OH], July 17, 1915, pg. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, teachers at the school were said to have been &quot;poorly paid&quot; and the school year limited to a truncated five months.&lt;ref name=CLA /&gt;

Today the city of Mound Bayou is served by the [[Mound Bayou Public School District]]. The district has two schools with a total enrollment of approximately 650 students.

'''Indianola''' is a city in [[Sunflower County, Mississippi|Sunflower County]], [[Mississippi]], in the [[Mississippi Delta]]. The population was 12,066 at the 2000 census. It is the [[county seat]] of Sunflower County{{GR|6}}.

==History==
The town was originally named &quot;Indian Bayou&quot; in 1882 because the site along the river bank was formerly inhabited by a [[Choctaw Indian]] village. Between 1882 and 1886, the town's name was changed from &quot;Indian Bayou&quot; to &quot;Eureka,&quot; then to &quot;Belengate,&quot; and finally &quot;Indianola,&quot; which was allegedly in honor of an Indian princess named &quot;Ola.&quot; The town population developed at this site due to the location of a lumber mill on the river.

In 1891, Minnie Cox was appointed postmaster of Indianola, becoming the first black female postmaster in the United States.  Her rank was raised from fourth class to third class in 1900, and she was appointed to a full four-year term.  Cox's position was one of the most respected and lucrative public posts in Indianola, as it served approximately 3,000 patrons and paid $1,100 annually—a large sum at that time.  White resentment to Cox's prestigious position began to grow, and in 1902 some white residents in Indianola drew up a petition requesting Cox’s resignation.  [[James K. Vardaman]], editor of the ''[[The Greenwood Commonwealth]]'' and a white supremacist, began delivering speeches reproaching the people of Indianola for “tolerating a negro [sic] wench as a postmaster.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;
Racial tensions grew, and threats of physical harm led Cox to submit her resignation to take effect January 1, 1903.  The incident attracted national attention, and [[Theodore Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]] refused to accept her resignation, feeling Cox had been wronged, and the authority of the federal government was being compromised.  &quot;Roosevelt stood resolute.

Roosevelt closed Indianola’s post office on January 2, 1903, and rerouted mail to Greenville; Cox continued to receive her salary.  That same month, the United States Senate debated the Indianola postal event for four hours, and Cox left Indianola for her own safety and did not return.  In February 1904, the post office was reopened, but demoted in rank from third class to fourth class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In the early and mid-twentieth century a number of Blues musicians originated in the area, including [[B.B. King]], who worked in the local cotton industry in Indianola in the 1940s before pursuing a professional musical career.

In July 1954, two months after the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] announced its unanimous decision in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]],'' ruling that school segregation was unconstitutional, the local plantation manager [[Robert B. Patterson]] met with a group of like-minded individuals in a private home in Indianola to form the [[White Citizens' Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = [[Gene Roberts (journalist)|Roberts, Gene]] and [[Hank Klibanoff]] | title = [[The Race Beat|The Race Beat: The Press, the Civil Rights Struggle, and the Awakening of a Nation]] | publisher = [[Alfred A.

==Economy==
Because Indianola is located at the intersection of [[U.S. Route 49W]] and [[U.S. Route 82]], as of 2004 it is one of the last economically viable small towns in the [[Mississippi Delta]]. In the 1980s and 1990s the city government convinced a major retailer to build a distribution center near the intersection of the two highways. This development infused cash into the local economy and allowed semiskilled jobs to be established.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moye28&quot;&gt;Moye, J. Todd.

Sarah Carr of ''[[The Atlantic]]'' explained that there are two explanations of why the private academies in Indianola and other towns still exist. One says that the public schools suffered from poor leadership and wrongdoing and that the public academies thrive because of the failings of the public schools, and the other says that the white leadership starved the public schools of resources after the academies were enacted, leading to the failings of the public schools.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, Sarah. &quot;[http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/12/in-southern-towns-segregation-academies-are-still-going-strong/266207/ In Southern Towns, 'Segregation Academies' Are Still Going Strong].&quot; ''[[The Atlantic]]''.

==Controversy==
::''Main article:''  [[2010 Itawamba County School District prom controversy]]
On April 3, 2010, school officials canceled the local prom in response to a court order requiring them to let a local student attend with her same-sex date. Allegations were made against the school of being biased and &quot;unfair&quot;[http://abclocal.go.com/wjrt/story?section=news/national_world&amp;id=7326777e]. In response to the canceled prom, local citizens decided to hold two private proms outside the school system's jurisdiction—one that was announced publicly, and one secret private prom [http://www.advocate.com/News/Daily_News/2010/04/05/ACLU_Investigating_Fake_Prom/]. The girl and her same-sex date were directed to attend the publicly announced event, attended by only a handful of students, instead of the secret private prom that most students attended.

== History ==
[[File:Williams Brothers store.JPG|thumb|left|Williams Brothers Store.]]
The region of Neshoba county and the surrounding counties was the heart of the [[Choctaw]] Nation from the 17th century until removal of most of the people in the 1830s. European-American settlers began to arrive in numbers in the early decades of the nineteenth century, after French, British and Spanish traders developed business relationships with the Choctaw.

Philadelphia is [[municipal corporation|incorporated as a municipality]]; it was given its current name in 1903, two years before the [[railroad]] brought new opportunities and prosperity to the town. The history of the town and its influences- social, political and economic- can be seen in the many points of interest within and beyond the city limits.  These range from the large ceremonial [[Indian mound]] and [[cave]] at [[Nanih Waiya]], built about 1700 years ago and sacred to the [[Choctaw]]; to the still thriving Williams Brothers Store, a true old-fashioned [[general store]] founded in 1907 and featured in ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' in 1939 as a source of anything from “needles to horse collars”, and still offering everything from [[bridle]]s, butter and boots to flour, feed and fashion.

===Native American===
{{Main|Choctaw|Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians}}
Many thousands of years ago, [[Paleo-Indians]] lived in what today is referred to as [[Southern United States|the American South]].&lt;ref name=guy_prentice&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] [[Choctaw people]] are descended from the [[Mississippian culture|Mississippian]] and other societies in the [[Mississippi embayment|Mississippi river valley]] encountered by Spanish explorers in the early 16th century. The Choctaw arose as a distinct people in the early 17th century and had trade relations with the French, British and Spanish during the colonial period.

After the United States victory in the [[American Revolutionary War]], Choctaw lands Alabama and Mississippi were encroached on by European-American settlers. Trying to create a boundary, they ceded land in several treaties with the United States, but settlers kept arriving in their territory. By 1830, after passage of the [[Indian Removal Act]], the Choctaw were forced to choose between removal to west of the Mississippi River, or becoming U.S. citizens and submitting to federal and state laws in Mississippi.&lt;ref name=remini_submit_expected&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Choctaw chiefs realized that removal was inevitable and had decided that military resistance was futile. [[Greenwood LeFlore]], elected the Principal Chief of all three divisions that year, negotiated and signed the [[Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek]] in an effort to get the best arrangements for the Choctaw that he could.  They were granted the largest amount of land in [[Indian Territory]], in the fertile southeast, in exchange for ceding the remainder of their traditional homeland in Mississippi and [[Alabama]].  They also were granted the option of remaining on reserved land in Mississippi as United States citizens, but the government did not give them all the land they deserved. The treaty represented one of the largest transfers of land that was signed between the U.S. Government and Native Americans without being instigated by warfare. The migration became known as the [[Choctaw Trail of Tears]].

===Murders of three civil rights workers===
{{Main|Mississippi civil rights workers murders}}
[[File:AndrewGoodman-JamesChaney-MichaelSchwerner.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Andrew Goodman]], [[James Chaney]], and [[Michael Schwerner]]]]
In the mid-twentieth century, Mississippi was a battleground of the [[civil rights movement]] as, like other states of the South, it had long [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchised]] African Americans and subjected them to [[racial segregation]] and [[Jim Crow]] laws.  Philadelphia in June 1964 was the scene of the murders of activists [[James Chaney]], a 21-year-old [[African American|black]] man from [[Meridian, Mississippi|Meridian]], [[Mississippi]]; [[Andrew Goodman]], a 20-year-old [[Jew]]ish [[anthropology]] student from [[New York]]; and [[Michael Schwerner]], a 24-year-old Jewish [[Congress of Racial Equality|CORE]] organizer and former [[social worker]], also from New York.  Their deaths demonstrated the risks that activists took to secure the constitutional rights of African Americans, but many more blacks than whites had been killed in the struggle.

[[Ku Klux Klan]] members (including Cecil Ray Price, the deputy sheriff of Neshoba County) released the three young men from jail, took them to an isolated spot, and killed them.  They buried them in an earthen dam.  It was some time after they disappeared before the bodies were discovered, as a result of an [[FBI]] investigation and national media attention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crmvet.org/tim/tim64b.htm#1964csg Lynching of Chaney, Schwerner &amp; Goodman] ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans&lt;/ref&gt; The national outrage over their deaths helped procure support for Congressional passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Civil Rights Act]] of 1964 and the [[Voting Rights Act]] of 1965.  The murders and related conspiracy gave rise to the &quot;Mississippi Burning&quot; trial, [[United States v. Price]].

===Reagan's visit===
{{main|Ronald Reagan's speech at the Neshoba County Fair}}
On August 3, 1980, [[Ronald Reagan]] gave his first post-[[political convention|convention]] speech at the [[Neshoba County Fair]] after being officially chosen as the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nominee for [[President of the United States]]. He said, &quot;I believe in states' rights ... I believe we have distorted the balance of our government today by giving powers that were never intended to be given in the Constitution to that federal establishment.&quot; He went on to promise to &quot;restore to states and local governments the power that properly belongs to them&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.onlinemadison.com/ftp/reagan/reaganneshoba.mp3&lt;/ref&gt; Analysts believed that his use of the phrase was seen by many as a tacit appeal to Southern white voters and a continuation of [[Richard Nixon]]'s [[Southern Strategy]], while some argued it reflected Reagan's [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] economic beliefs. The speech drew attention for his use of the phrase &quot;[[states' rights]]&quot; at a place just a few miles from a town associated with the [[Mississippi civil rights workers murders|1964 murders of civil rights workers]].

===Trial of Edgar Ray Killen===
In 2004, the [[Hinds County, Mississippi|Hinds County]] sheriff, Malcolm MacMillan, called for re-opening of the case against [[Edgar Ray Killen]], a suspect in the murder of three civil rights workers in 1964. Killen was arrested for three counts of murder on January 6, 2005. He was freed on bond.

The trial began on June 13, 2005, with Killen attending in a [[wheelchair]]. He was found guilty of manslaughter on June 21, 2005, 41 years to the day after the crime.  The jury of nine whites and three blacks rejected the charges of murder, but found him guilty of recruiting the mob that carried out the killings. He was sentenced on June 23, 2005 by Circuit Judge Marcus Gordon to the maximum sentence of 60 years in prison,&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, Sophia. &quot;[http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=a.SFJt__7oi4&amp;refer=top_world_news Killen Sentenced to 60 Years in Prison in 1964 Deaths (Update4)].&quot; ''[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]''. June 23, 2005. Retrieved on August 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; 20 years for each count of manslaughter, to be served consecutively. He will be eligible for [[parole]] after serving at least 20 years, although it is unlikely he will live this long given his age and health. At the sentencing, Judge Gordon stated that each life lost was valuable; he strongly asserted that the law made no distinction of age for the crime and that the maximum sentence should be imposed. Killen entered the [[Mississippi Department of Corrections]] system on June 27, 2005.

Canton, where he joined the ranks of musicians like [[B.B. King]] and [[Little Milton]] to play
the blues on Hickory Street. Today’s blues trail marker
not only recognizes the achievements of the talented Elmore James but also pays tribute
to Canton’s colorful blues heritage.&lt;ref name=trailmarker/&gt;}}

[[Image:Holly Springs Depot.jpg|250px|thumbnail|Holly Springs railroad depot]][[Image:Holly Springs home.jpg||right|250px|thumbnail|Montrose, a Holly Springs mansion.]]'''Holly Springs''' is a city in [[Marshall County, Mississippi|Marshall County]], [[Mississippi]], [[United States]]. 

Near the [[Mississippi Delta]], the area was developed as cotton [[plantations]], which depended on [[Slavery in the United States|slave]] labor. After the [[American Civil War]], many [[freedmen]] worked as sharecroppers and tenant farmers. As the county seat, the city is a center of trade and court sessions. 

The population was 7,957 at the 2000 census. A slight decrease in population was calculated in the 2010 census.  Holly Springs is the [[county seat]] of Marshall County{{GR|6}}.

==Geography==
Holly Springs is located at {{coord|34|46|24|N|89|26|47|W|type:city}} (34.773435, -89.446519){{GR|1}}.
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|12.7|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|12.7|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|0.04|sqmi|km2}} (0.16%) is water.

==History==
Holly Springs was founded by European Americans in 1836, on territory historically occupied by [[Chickasaw]] Indians for centuries before [[Indian Removal]].&lt;ref name = haines /&gt; It served as a trading center for the neighboring cotton plantations. The next year it was made seat of the newly created Marshall County, named for [[John Marshall]], the Supreme Court justice.

By 1855 Holly Springs was connected to [[Grand Junction, Tennessee]] by the advancing [[Mississippi Central Railway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85038518/1856-04-29/ed-1/seq-2/ | title = Mississippi Central and Tennessee Rail Road. | date = 1856-04-29 | accessdate = 2011-10-25 | newspaper = Nashville union and American | publisher = John L. Marling &amp; Co}} via [[Chronicling America]] website&lt;/ref&gt; In ensuing years, the line was completed to the south of Hill Springs. Toward the end of the century, the [[Kansas City, Memphis and Birmingham Railroad]] was constructed to intersect this line in Holly Springs.

During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], the town was used by General [[Ulysses S. Grant]] as a supply depot and headquarters. In a raid headed by Confederate [[Earl Van Dorn]] in December 1862, most of the supplies stored there were demolished.

In 1878 the city suffered a [[yellow fever]] epidemic in which 2,000 residents died. The existing Marshall County Courthouse, at the center of Holly Springs' square, was used as a hospital during the epidemic.&lt;ref name = haines&gt;{{cite web | url = http://marshallcountyms.org/locales/hshist.php | title = History of Holly Springs | last = Haines | first = Deb | accessdate = 2011-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Madison''' is a city in [[Madison County, Mississippi|Madison County]], [[Mississippi]]. The population was 14,691 at the [[2000 U.S. census|2000 census]]. The population is currently 16,930. It is part of the [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]] [[Jackson, Mississippi metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]]. It is currently the highest income city in the state.  It is ranked the 2nd most livable city in Mississippi by AreaVibes.com.

==History==
Madison, named for [[James Madison]], the fourth [[President of the United States|President]] of the [[United States]], grew up along a bustling railroad track in antebellum [[Mississippi]]. It began in 1856 when the [[Illinois Central Railroad]] opened Madison Station, the forerunner of the city of Madison. Although nearby Madisonville, a settlement established along the stagecoach route on the [[Natchez Trace]], had a race track, two banks, a wagon factory and at least one hotel, its residents gradually moved to the new town. The little railroad community began to thrive, and Madisonville became extinct.

Like many railroad towns in the [[Southern United States|South]], Madison Station was heavily damaged by the [[Union Army]] during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Ten miles from the state capital of [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]], Madison Station was largely destroyed in 1863, after the July 18–22 siege of Jackson. No battles were fought in Madison County, but Major General [[Stephen D. Lee]] concentrated his command in Madison Station during the month of February 1864. Stephen Lee would later become the first president of Mississippi State College (now [[Mississippi State University]]).

The railroad continued to attract growth after the Civil War. In 1897, the Madison Land Company encouraged northerners to &quot;Go South, and grow up with the country.&quot; Located in [[Chicago]], the land company’s interest in development prompted Madison to incorporate as a village, though the charter was later lost when regular elections were not held because of the failure of the &quot;land boom&quot;.

The Madison Land Company offered prime land for as little as $3.00 an acre. It claimed that Mississippi had the lowest debt ratio in the United States at $19.00 per capita and that Mississippians were declared one-third healthier by &quot;official figures&quot; than people in [[New York]] and [[Massachusetts]]. The figures were quoted in the Madison Land Company's brochure by Bishop Hugh Miller Thompson, the second Episcopal Bishop of the Diocese of Mississippi and a Madison resident, who originally came from [[Wisconsin]].

After many years of court battles, the city limits expanded greatly in size in the late 2000s.

==Sister city==
*{{flagicon|Sweden}} [[Sollefteå]], [[Sweden]]

Madison officials first explored the possibility of creating a sister city relationship with [[Sollefteå]], [[Sweden]] in 1995. The idea grew out of a meeting between Madison County economic development representatives and executives representing the Sollefteå-based forestry products company, Haglof, Inc., who were investigating the feasibility of opening a plant in Madison. This was further strengthened by local residents of Swedish extraction. Names such as Lindquist are common in the Greater Madison area.

Talks began, and a January 1997 video conference call between the two cities facilitated the meeting. Five months later, a delegation of over 30 members arrived in Madison to tour the city and to ratify the sister city relationship. During that visit, [http://www.haglofsweden.com/adress/HaglofInc.asp Haglöf, Inc]. opened its new office and the Swedish company Mini Tube also announced plans to locate a facility in Madison.

A 34-member delegation from Madison flew to Sweden in May 1997 for a five-day tour of Sollefteå. They were interested in learning about the Swedish city's economic development efforts, cultural facilities, innovations in education and ability to attract visitors and businesses to the area. The delegation toured industrial sites, such as Haglöf Inc.’s facilities, an energy plant and a communications company. They also visited a forestry school and environmental center.

The Swedish-American Chamber of Commerce South Central U.S. was created as a result of this relationship and it now serves [[Mississippi]], [[Alabama]], [[Arkansas]], [[Louisiana]] and [[Tennessee]].

==Education==
The City of Madison is served by the [[Madison County School District (Mississippi)|Madison County School District]].  The Student/Teacher Ratio is 19:1.

In 2010, [[Tulane University]] opened a satellite campus of its School of Continuing Studies. The campus is housed in a renovated wing of the former Madison Station Elementary School (Madison Ridgeland High School) campus.&lt;ref&gt;http://tulane.edu/news/releases/pr_083109.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;

Jackson State University opened a satellite campus in the city.

'''Meridian''' is the sixth largest city in the [[U.S. State]] of [[Mississippi]].{{GR|6}} It is the [[county seat]] of [[Lauderdale County, Mississippi|Lauderdale County]] and the principal city of the [[Meridian, Mississippi Micropolitan Statistical Area]]. Along major highways, the city is {{convert|93|mi|abbr=on}} east of [[Jackson, Mississippi]]; {{convert|154|mi|abbr=on}} west of [[Birmingham, Alabama]]; {{convert|202|mi|abbr=on}} northeast of [[New Orleans, Louisiana]]; and {{convert|231|mi|abbr=on}} southeast of [[Memphis, Tennessee]].

Established in 1860 at the intersection of the [[Mobile and Ohio Railroad]] and [[Southern Railway (U.S.)|Southern Railway]] of Mississippi, Meridian relied heavily on the rails and goods transported on them. [[Union Station (Meridian, Mississippi)|Union Station]] is now also home to several other modes of transportation, including the [[Meridian Transit System]], [[Greyhound lines|Greyhound Buses]], and [[Trailways]], averaging 242,360 passengers per year. During the [[American Civil War]], much of the city was burned to the ground by General [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] in the [[Battle of Meridian]].

Rebuilt after the war, the city entered a &quot;Golden Age&quot;, becoming the largest city in Mississippi between 1890 and 1930 and a leading center for manufacturing in the South. It had 44 trains coming in and out daily. Although its economy slowed with the decline of the railroad industry, the city has diversified, with healthcare, military, and manufacturing employing the most people in 2010. The population within the city limits, according to 2008 [[United States Census|census]] estimates, is 38,232, but a population of 232,900 in a {{convert|45|mi|adj=on}} radius and 526,500 in a {{convert|65|mi|adj=on}} radius, of which 104,600 and 234,200 people respectively are in the labor force, feed the economy of the city.

The area is served by two military facilities, [[Naval Air Station Meridian]] and [[Key Field]], which provide over 4,000 jobs to the surrounding area. NAS Meridian is home to the Regional Counter-Drug Training Academy (RCTA) and the first local [[Department of Homeland Security]] in the state. Key Field is named after [[The Flying Keys|Fred and Al Key]], who set a world endurance flight record in 1935. The field is now home to the [[186th Air Refueling Wing]] of the [[Air National Guard]] and a support facility for the [[185th Aviation Brigade (United States)|185th Aviation Brigade]] of the [[Army National Guard]]. Rush Foundation Hospital is the largest non-military employer in the region, employing 2,610 people.

Among the city's many arts organizations and historic buildings are the [[Riley Center]], the [[Meridian Museum of Art]], Meridian Little Theatre, and the Meridian Symphony Orchestra. Meridian was also home to two [[Carnegie libraries]], one for African Americans and one for whites. Residents organized to build the [[Carnegie Branch Library (Meridian, Mississippi)|African American library]], the only Carnegie library built for blacks in the country. The city has been selected as the future location of the Mississippi Arts and Entertainment Center (MAEC). [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]], the &quot;Father of Country Music&quot;, was born in Meridian. [[Highland Park (Meridian, Mississippi)|Highland Park]] houses a museum which displays memorabilia of his life and career, as well as railroad equipment from the steam-engine era. The park is also home to the [[Highland Park Dentzel Carousel and Shelter Building|Highland Park Dentzel Carousel]], a [[National Historic Landmark]] – the world's only two-row stationary Dentzel menagerie in existence. Other notable natives include [[Miss America 1986]] [[Susan Akin]], [[James Chaney]] – one of the victims of the [[Mississippi civil rights workers murders]] in 1964, and [[Hartley Peavey]], founder of [[Peavey Electronics]] which is headquartered in Meridian. The federal courthouse was the site of the 1966-1967 trial of suspects in the murder of Chaney and two other activists; it was the first time a white jury convicted a white official of a civil rights killing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robertson&quot;/&gt;

Previously inhabited by the [[Choctaw]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], the area now called Meridian was obtained by the United States under the terms of the [[Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek]] in 1830.&lt;ref name=&quot;website&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.meridianms.org/history.htm |title=History of Meridian, MS |accessdate=2008-06-07 |publisher=Official website of Meridian, MeridianMS.org}}{{dead link|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the treaty was ratified, [[European-American]] settlers began to move into the area. After receiving a federal [[land grant]] of about {{convert|2000|acres}},&lt;ref name=&quot;mclemore&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Jody Cook|date=December 4, 1979|work=National Register of Historic Places|title=NRHP Nomination:McLemore Cemetery|publisher=National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard McLemore, the first settler of Meridian,&lt;ref name=&quot;website&quot;/&gt; began offering free land to newcomers to attract more settlers to the region and develop the area.&lt;ref name=&quot;mra&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pdfhost.focus.nps.gov/docs/NRHP/Text/64000416.pdf |title=Meridian Multiple Resource Area Nomination | work=National Register of Historic Places |accessdate=2008-06-07 |publisher=National Park Service |date=1979-12-18 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of McLemore's land was bought by Lewis A.

There was much competition over the proposed name of the settlement. Ball and the more industrial residents of the city supported the name &quot;Meridian,&quot; believing the term to be synonymous with &quot;junction&quot;; the more agrarian residents of the city preferred &quot;Sowashee&quot; (meaning &quot;mad river&quot; in a Native American language), the name of a nearby creek; and Ragsdale proposed &quot;Ragsdale City.&quot;&lt;ref name=msguide1938&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.archive.org/details/mississippiguide00federich|title=Mississippi:A Guide to the Magnolia State|author=Federal Writers' Project of the Works Progress Administration (Miss.)|publisher=Hastings House|location=New York|year=1938}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;railroad&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.queenandcrescent.org/meridian_rr_history.html |title=Meridian Railroad History |accessdate=2008-06-08 |publisher=National Railway Historical Society, Queen &amp; Crescent Chapter |author=Mick Nussbaum |date=2007-08-05}}{{dead link|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ball erected a station house on the [[Mobile and Ohio Railroad]] – the sign on which would alternate between &quot;Meridian&quot; and &quot;Sowashee&quot; each day. Eventually the continued development of the railroads led to an influx of railroad workers who overruled the others in the city and left &quot;Meridian&quot; on the station permanently,&lt;ref name=msguide1938/&gt; and the town was officially incorporated as Meridian on February 10, 1860.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:General sherman.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Union General [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] invaded Meridian in 1864]]
Meridian was a small village at the start of the [[American Civil War]] in 1861. Its strategic position at the railroad junction led to the construction of several military installations for the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt; During the [[Battle of Meridian]] in 1864, General [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] led troops into the city, destroying the railroads in every direction, an arsenal, immense storehouses,&lt;ref name=memoirs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonofthesouth.net/union-generals/sherman/memoirs/general-sherman-meridan-campaign.htm|title= Memoirs of General W.T.

The city continued to grow thanks to a [[city commission government|commission government]]'s efforts to bring in 90 new industrial plants in 1913 and a booming automobile industry in the 1920s. Even through the [[stock market crash of 1929]] and the following [[Great Depression]], the city continued to attract new businesses. With [[escapism]] becoming popular in the culture during the depth of the Depression, the [[S. H.

After a brief slowdown of the economy at the end of the Depression, the country entered [[World War II]], which renewed the importance of railroads. The rails were essential to transport gasoline and scrap metal to build military vehicles, so Meridian became the region's rail center again. This renewed prosperity continued until the 1950s, when the automobile and [[Interstate Highway System]] became more popular than passenger rails.&lt;ref name=DowntownHD/&gt; The decline of the railroad industry caused significant job losses, resulting in a population decline as workers left for other areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;mra&quot;/&gt;

During the [[American Civil Rights Movement]] in the 1960s, Meridian was home to a [[Council of Federated Organizations]] (COFO) office and several other activist organizations.&lt;ref name=DowntownHD/&gt; [[James Chaney]] and other local residents, along with [[Michael Schwerner]], his wife Rita, and [[Andrew Goodman]], volunteers from the North, worked on creating a community center to help prepare [[African American]]s in the area to regain the power to vote.&lt;ref name=&quot;schwerner&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/price&amp;bowers/Schwerner.htm |title=Biography of Michael Schwerner |publisher=[[University of Missouri-Kansas City]] |accessdate=2008-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whites in the area resented the activism, and racial tension often translated to violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crmvet.org/docs/msrv64.pdf|title=Mississippi: Subversion of the Right to Vote|publisher=Civil Rights Movement Veterans|page=5|accessdate=2010-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1964, Chaney, Schwerner, and Goodman went to [[Neshoba County, Mississippi]] to meet with members of a black church which had been bombed and burned. The three disappeared that night on their way back to Meridian,&lt;ref name=&quot;schwerner&quot;/&gt; and their bodies were discovered, buried in an earthen dam, two months later.

Seven [[Klansmen]], including a deputy sheriff, were convicted in the federal courthouse in Meridian of &quot;depriving the victims of their civil rights&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Robertson&quot;/&gt; and three were acquitted in the [[Mississippi civil rights workers murders]] trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://themiddleoftheinternet.com/Chaney_Goodman_Schwerner.htm |title=Civil Rights Murders |accessdate=2008-06-08 |author=Susan Klopfer}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time that a white jury had convicted &quot;a white official in a civil rights killing.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Robertson&quot;&gt;Campbell Robertson, &quot;Last Chapter for a Courthouse Where Mississippi Faced Its Past&quot;, ''New York Times'', 18 September 2012, p. 1, 16&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the case was reopened by the state, which brought charges in the case for the first time.

Starting in the 1960s, residents began to move away from downtown in favor of new subdivisions north of downtown. After strip commercial interests began to move downtown, the city worked to designate several areas as [[historic district (United States)|historic districts]] in the 1970s and 80s to preserve the architectural character of the city.&lt;ref name=mra /&gt; The Meridian Historic Districts and Landmarks Commission was created in 1979, and the Meridian Main Street program was founded in 1985.&lt;ref name=mra /&gt;

[[File:Meridian from 22nd Ave Bridge.jpg|thumb|Looking into downtown Meridian from the 22nd Avenue Bridge in 2008. The [[Hotel Meridian]] was later demolished.]]

Many historic hotels have existed in Meridian throughout its history. Even before Meridian reached its &quot;Golden Age,&quot; several large hotels including the Great Southern and the Grand Avenue hotels were built before the start of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=shankhotels&gt;{{cite book|title=Meridian: The Queen with a Past|author=Jack Shank|publisher=Southeastern Printing Company|location=Meridian, Mississippi|year=1986|isbn=0-9616123-2-0|volume=Volume II|pages=6–12|chapter=Chapter 2: A City of Hotels}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the growth of the railroads and the construction of the original [[Union Station (Meridian, Mississippi)|Union Station]] in 1906, many hotels were constructed for passengers and workers.&lt;ref name=DowntownHD/&gt; The Elmira Hotel was constructed in 1905,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meridianms.org/downtownhistoricresources/1.html|title=Elmira Hotel|publisher=City of Meridian|accessdate=2012-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Terminal Hotel was constructed in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meridianms.org/downtownhistoricresources/4.html|title=Terminal Hotel|publisher=City of Meridian|accessdate=2012-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hotel Meridian]] was constructed in 1907, and [[Union Hotel (Meridian, Mississippi)|Union Hotel]] was built in 1908.&lt;ref name=shankhotels/&gt; Union Hotel was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1979,&lt;ref name=nris/&gt; and both Hotel Meridian and Grand Avenue Hotel were listed as [[contributing properties]] to the [[Meridian Urban Center Historic District]].&lt;ref name=DowntownHD/&gt;

As the city grew, the hotels grew as well, as evidenced by the eleven-story skyscraper [[Lamar Hotel]] built in 1927.&lt;ref name=shankhotels/&gt; Lamar Hotel today serves as a county annex building and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.&lt;ref name=nris/&gt; It was also listed as a [[Mississippi Landmark]] in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apps.mdah.ms.gov/Public/prop.aspx?id=16636&amp;view=facts&amp;y=774|title=Lamar Hotel|publisher=Mississippi Department of Archives and History|accessdate=2012-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[E.F. Young Hotel]] was established in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.efyoungjr.com/current/The_Legacy/the_legacy.html|title=The Legacy|publisher=E.F.

As the city became more suburb-focused in the 1960s and '70s, most hotels moved outside of downtown. There has been a push for a new downtown hotel, sparked by the rehabilitation of the [[Riley Center]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://meridianstar.com/local/x657346372/Threefoot-Building-Part-1-Looking-at-all-our-options|title=Threefoot Building: Part 1 'Looking at all our options': Development, demolition and stabilization|date=June 27, 2010|author=Jennifer Jacob Brown|newspaper=The Meridian Star|accessdate=2012-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://meridianstar.com/local/x681064804/Riley-Center-officials-get-set-to-go|title=Riley Center officials get set to go|date=August 20, 2006|author=Georgia E.

While the overall population growth of the city has been inconsistent, there has been a steady growth in the number of [[non-white]] residents. The only decline in this group was between 1960 and 1970, when the city's overall population saw a large decline. As the number of non-white residents increased, the number of white residents decreased. Between 1980 and 2000, the number of white residents dropped by 11,030 (38.6%). Since the overall population of Lauderdale County has remained fairly constant, this data suggests that white residents have been moving to more rural or suburban areas.&lt;ref name=demographics/&gt; In the 2000 Census, the racial makeup of the city was 54.4% [[African American (U.S. Census)|African American]], 44.0% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 0.6% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], 0.2% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], &lt;0.1% [[Pacific Islander (U.S. Census)|Pacific Islander]], 0.3% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]], and 0.6% from two or more races. [[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]] of any race were 1.1% of the population.{{GR|2}}

According to the 2000 Census, of the 17,890 housing units inside city limits, 15,966 were occupied, 10,033 of them by families. 31.1% of occupied households had children under the age of 18, 36.2% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 23.3% consisted of a female householder with no husband present, and 37.2% were non-families. 33.2% of all households were made up of individuals, and 14.0% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.39 and the average family size was 3.06.{{GR|2}} The average household size has steadily decreased since 1970 when it was 3.04. On the other hand, Meridian's median age has increased from 30.4 in 1970 to 34.6 in 2000.&lt;ref name=demographics/&gt;

The median income for a household in the city was $25,085, and the median income for a family was $31,062. Males had a median income of $29,404 versus $19,702 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the city was $15,255.  About 24.6% of families and 28.6% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 40.8% of those under age 18 and 22.0% of those age 65 or over.{{GR|2}}

===Religion===
The population of Meridian and its surrounds is fairly observant, with 65.2% of Lauderdale County affiliated with some type of religious congregation, compared with the national average of 50.2%.&lt;ref name=citydata&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.city-data.com/city/Meridian-Mississippi.html|title=Meridian, Mississippi City Data|accessdate=2010-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the affiliated in 2000, 30,068 (59.0%) were in the [[Southern Baptist Convention]], 9,469 (18.6%) were with the [[United Methodist Church]], and 1,872 (3.7%) were associated with the [[Catholic Church]].&lt;ref name=citydata/&gt;&lt;ref name=arda&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thearda.com/mapsReports/reports/counties/28075_2000_Adherents.asp|title=Association of Religion Data Archives – Lauderdale County, Mississippi|year=2002|accessdate=2010-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography and climate==
Meridian is located in the North Central Hills region of [[Mississippi]] in [[Lauderdale County, Mississippi|Lauderdale County]]. According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|45.9|sqmi|abbr=on}}, of which {{convert|45.1|sqmi|abbr=on}} is land and {{convert|0.8|sqmi|abbr=on}} is water. Along major highways, the city is {{convert|93|mi|abbr=on}} east of [[Jackson, Mississippi]]; {{convert|154|mi|abbr=on}} west of [[Birmingham, Alabama]]; {{convert|202|mi|abbr=on}} northeast of [[New Orleans, Louisiana]]; {{convert|231|mi|abbr=on}} southeast of [[Memphis, Tennessee]]; and {{convert|297|mi|abbr=on}} west of [[Atlanta, Georgia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;distance&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.netdoor.com/~takano/meridian.html| title=Meridian, MS |accessdate=2008-06-07 |publisher=Netdoor.com |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area surrounding the city is covered with cotton and corn fields along with oak and pine forests, and its [[topography]] consists of clay hills and the bottom lands of the [[Source (river or stream)|head waters]] of the [[Chickasawhay River]].&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt;

The natural terrain of the area has been modified in the urban core of the city by [[grading (construction)|grading]], but it maintains its gentle rolling character in the outlying areas. Numerous small creeks are found throughout the city and small lakes and woodlands lie in the northern and southern portions of the city. Sowashee Creek runs through the southern portion of the city and branches off into Gallagher's Creek, which flows through the center of the city. Loper's Creek runs through the far-western part of the city while smaller creeks including Shearer's Branch, Magnolia Creek, and Robbins Creek are dispersed throughout the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;mra&quot;/&gt;

Meridian is in the [[humid subtropical]] climate zone. The average high temperature during summer (June through August) is around {{convert|90|°F}} and the average low is around {{convert|70|°F}}. In winter (December through February) the average maximum is around {{convert|60|°F}} and minimum {{convert|35|°F}}. The warmest month is July, with an average high of {{convert|92.9|°F}}, and the coldest month of the year is January with an average low of {{convert|34.7|°F}}.

The average annual [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] in the city is {{convert|58.65|in|mm|abbr=on}}. Rainfall is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year, and the wettest month of the year is March, in which an average of {{convert|6.93|in|mm|abbr=on}} of rain falls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.idcide.com/weather/ms/meridian.htm |title=Meridian, MS Weather |publisher=IDcide |accessdate=2008-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much rainfall is delivered by [[ Thunderstorms ]] which are common during the summer months but occur throughout the year. Severe thunderstorms - which can produce damaging winds and/or large hail in addition to the usual hazards of lightning and heavy rain - occasionally occur. These are most common during the spring months with a secondary peak during the Fall months. These storms also bring the risk of [[ Tornadoes ]]. {{Weather box |imperial first = Y

Early on, the economy depended greatly upon the railroads in the area.

With these rail-based industries, the city was a great economic power in the state and region from about 1890 through 1930.&lt;ref name=&quot;website&quot;/&gt; Though its economy slowed with the decline of the railroading industry in the 1950s,&lt;ref name=mra/&gt; the city has adapted, moving from a largely rail-based economy to a more diversified one, with healthcare, military, and manufacturing employing the most people.&lt;ref name=embdc/&gt;

[[File:Meridian Museum of Art.JPG|thumb|[[Meridian Museum of Art]]]]
Known for more than a century of arts, Meridian contains many art and cultural organizations and hosts many cultural events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Retirement |url=http://www.meridianms.org/retire.html |publisher=City of Meridian |date=2009-07-01 |accessdate=27 August 2009}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first art organizations in the city, The Meridian Art League, was established in February 1933. Art exhibitions were originally held in Lamar Hotel in downtown Meridian, but after a name change to Meridian Art Association in 1949, exhibitions were held at various locations around the city. After the [[Carnegie library]] at 25th Ave and 7th St was closed, the Art Association remodelled the building into the [[Meridian Museum of Art]] to serve as a permanent home for exhibits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Anne |last=McKee |title=The Little Museum that could, and did, thrives into the Twenty-First century |url=http://www.meridianstar.com/columns/local_story_117004817.html |work=Meridian Star |date=2007-04-26 |accessdate=27 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum was opened in 1970 and has since featured rotating exhibitions as well as many educational programs for both students and adults. Over thirty exhibitions are held annually, ranging from traditional decorative arts to ethnographic and tribal materials, photography, crafts, and many other works of art. The collection also includes 18th and 19th century portraits, 20th century photography, and several sculptures.&lt;ref name=&quot;meridian&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Culture &amp; Recreation |url=http://www.meridianms.org/culture_attraction.htm |publisher=City of Meridian |date=2008-07-12 |accessdate=27 August 2009}}{{dead link|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Meridian Council for the Arts (MCA) was founded as Meridian's and [[Lauderdale County, MS|Lauderdale County]]'s official arts agency in 1978. MCA operates its Community Art Grants program, the annual [[Threefoot Building#Threefoot Festival|Threefoot Festival]], several workshops, and other special events each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://meridianarts.org/site1/who|title=Meridian Council for the Arts – Who We Are|publisher=Meridian Council for the Arts|accessdate=2010-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; MCA is partnered with many arts organizations in the city and county including the Meridian Museum of Art, the Meridian Little Theatre, and the Meridian Symphony Orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://meridianarts.org/site1/our_partners|title=Meridian Council for the Arts – Our Partners|publisher=Meridian Council for the Arts|accessdate=2010-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meridian Little Theatre, one of the South's oldest subscription-based community theatres, was built in 1932 and currently provides entertainment to residents of and visitors to Meridian and Lauderdale County, entertaining over 22,000 guests each season, making it Mississippi's most-attended community theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.meridianlittletheatre.com/about/history/ |title=Meridian Little Theatre: History |publisher=Meridian Little Theatre |accessdate=2009-08-27}}{{dead link|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Meridian Symphony Orchestra (MSO) – founded in 1961 – played its first concert in 1962 and its first full season in 1963. In 1965 the MSO booked its first international soloist, [[Elena Nikolaidi]], to perform with the orchestra. The Orchestra helped the [[Meridian Public School District]] develop its own orchestra and strings programs and also helped develop the Meridian Symphony Chorus. The current conductor is Dr. Claire Fox Hillard, who has been with the orchestra since 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meridiansymphonyorchestra.com/about_us.html|title=Meridian Symphony Orchestry – About Us|accessdate=2011-01-27}}{{dead link|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MSO will celebrate its 50th anniversary in February 2011 with a performance from [[Itzhak Perlman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Symphonys_50th_Anniversary_Celebration_114749319.html |title=Symphony's 50th Anniversary Celebration Feb. 26|date=January 27, 2011|publisher=WTOK-TV|accessdate=2011-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Grand Opera House Meridan MS.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Riley Center]], renovated in 2006]]
The city's former [[Grand Opera House (Meridian, Mississippi)|Grand Opera House]] was built in 1889 by two half brothers, Israel Marks and Levi Rothenberg. During its operation the opera house hosted many famous artists and works, the first being a German company's rendition of [[Johann Strauss II]]'s &quot;[[The Gypsy Baron]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=operahousehistory&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mshistory.k12.ms.us/articles/167/grand-opera-house-of-mississippi|title=Mississippi History Now – Grand Opera House of Mississippi|author=Dennis J.

A $10 million grant in 2000 by the Riley Foundation, a local foundation chartered in 1998, sparked the building's restoration while $15 million came from a combination of city, county, and federal grants.&lt;ref name=operahousehistory/&gt; The opera house's renovation was completed in September 2006 under the new name &quot;Mississippi State University Riley Center for Education and Performing Arts.&quot; The Riley Center, which includes a 950-seat auditorium for live performances, a 200-seat studio theater, and {{convert|30000|sqft|0|abbr=on}} of meeting space,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=MSU Riley Center Overview |url=http://www.msurileycenter.com/about_us/overview.cfm |publisher=Mississippi State University Meridian Campus |date=2008-07-08 |accessdate=27 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; attracts more than 60,000 visitors to downtown Meridian annually for conferences, meetings, and performances.&lt;ref name=2008economy/&gt;

Meridian has also been selected as the future location of the Mississippi Arts and Entertainment Center (MAEC). The [[Mississippi Legislature]] approved the idea in 2001&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msarts.org/about_us.html|title=Mississippi Arts and Entertainment Center – About Us|accessdate=2010-05-24}}{{dead link|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2006 promised $4 million in funding if private contributors could raise $8 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://meridianstar.com/editorials/x681054649/Arts-and-Entertainment-Center-gets-a-boost|title=Meridian Star – Arts and Entertainment Center Gets a Boost|author=|date=March 29, 2006|publisher=The Meridian Star|accessdate=2010-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city donated $50,000 to the cause in September 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://meridianstar.com/local/x681089105/City-donates-50-000-to-proposed-state-arts-and-entertainment-project|title=Meridian Star – City Donates $50,000 to Proposed State Arts and Entertainment Project|author=Ida Brown|date=September 4, 2007|publisher=The Meridian Star|accessdate=2010-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MAEC, as proposed, would be located on {{convert|175|acre}} at Bonita Lakes and consist of an outdoor [[amphitheatre]], an indoor concert hall, and a Hall of Fame honoring Mississippi artists.&lt;ref name=attractions/&gt; The Hall of Fame will be located downtown in the old Montana's building.

===Railroads and public transit===
[[Image:Union Station Meridian MS 1.JPG|thumb|Meridian's [[Meridian (Amtrak station)|Union Station]].]]
[[Amtrak]]'s [[Crescent (Amtrak)|Crescent line]] connects Meridian with the cities of [[New York, New York]]; [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]; [[Baltimore, Maryland]]; [[Washington, D.C.]]; [[Charlotte, North Carolina]]; [[Atlanta, Georgia]]; [[Birmingham, Alabama]]; and [[New Orleans, Louisiana]]. The [[Meridian (Amtrak station)|Union Station Multi-Modal Transportation Center (MMTC)]] is located at 1901 Front Street, part of the Meridian Downtown Historic District, which is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. Originally built in 1906, but later demolished in 1966 then rebuilt in 1997, the station includes several modes of transportation including the [[Meridian Transit System]], [[Amtrak]], [[Norfolk Southern|Norfolk Southern rail corridor]], [[Greyhound lines|Greyhound buses]], [[Trailways]] and other providers of transit services. The number of passengers on Amtrak trains, Greyhound buses, and Meridian Transit System buses averages 242,360 per year.&lt;ref name=&quot;faq&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.meridianms.org/faq.html |title=Meridian, MS FAQ |accessdate=2007-06-07 |publisher=Official website of Meridian, MeridianMS.org}}{{dead link|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Air===
The city is served by [[Meridian Regional Airport]], located at Key Field, 2811 Airport Boulevard South, {{convert|3|mi|abbr=on}} southwest of the city. At {{Convert|10004|foot|m}}, the airport's runway is the longest public runway in Mississippi. The airport, which has been in service since 1930, offers daily flights to [[Atlanta, Georgia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meridianairport.com/|title=Meridian Regional Airport|accessdate=2009-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Great Depression, residents of the city contemplated abandoning the airport because of the cost of maintenance, but in 1935 Brothers [[The Flying Keys|Fred and Al Key]], managers of the airport, thought of a way to keep the airport operating. From June 4 until July 1, 1935, the brothers flew over the city in their plane, the &quot;Ole Miss.&quot; The record they established in their 27 days aloft, totaling 653 hours and 34 minutes, attracted enough publicity and funds to the city to keep the airport running. Key Field is therefore named after the brothers, whose flight endurance record remains unbroken in conventional flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meridianairport.com/generalinformation.html|title=Meridian Regional Airport – General Information|accessdate=2009-07-15}}{{dead link|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early public education in Meridian was based on the 1870 [[Mississippi Constitution]]. From 1870 to 1885, trustees appointed by the City Council served on the Board of School Directors, which had authority to operate the schools.&lt;ref name=wechslernom&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Fonda Rush|date=May 29, 1991|work=National Register of Historic Places|title=NRHP Nomination:Wechsler School|publisher=National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there were several schools in the city before 1884, they were privately owned and only enrolled about 400 students. The city did not build its first publicly owned school until September 1884.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.archive.org/details/meridian00gray|title=Meridian Illustrated 1904|last=Gray|first=William F.|accessdate=2009-07-16|year=1904|publisher=T.

'''Olive Branch''' is a city in [[DeSoto County, Mississippi|DeSoto County]], [[Mississippi]]. The population was 33,484 at the 2010 census. Olive Branch is a suburb of [[Memphis, Tennessee]] and is part of the [[Memphis metropolitan area|Memphis Metropolitan Statistical Area]], a region that consists of three counties in southwest Tennessee, five counties in northwest Mississippi, and two counties in eastern [[Arkansas]]. From 1990 to 2010 Olive Branch was the fastest growing city in the United States with a growth rate of 838%.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/2011/apr/28/desoto-city-fastest-in-growth/&lt;/ref&gt; Along with other rapidly growing suburbs in DeSoto County, Olive Branch attributes most of its growth and development to the exodus of large numbers of middle-class families from central Memphis.

==History==
[[File:Olive Branch MS 060 Historic Downtown.jpg|thumb|left|Historic downtown in Olive Branch, Mississippi]]
The first permanent Anglo settlers in the area were Stephen Flinn and his wife's brother-in-law, Milton Blocker. On April 13, 1836, they purchased {{convert|1280|acre|km2}} of land – known as Sections 34 and 35 – in newly created DeSoto County from [[Chickasaw]] chief Lush-Pun-Tubby for $1,600.&lt;ref name=&quot;Our History&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ci.olive-branch.ms.us/content/si_our_history.php | title = Our History | format = | work = | publisher = City of Olive Branch | date =  | accessdate = 2009-07-12}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dates&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ci.olive-branch.ms.us/content/si_historical_dates.php | title = Dates in Our History | format = | work = | publisher = City of Olive Branch | date =  | accessdate = 2009-07-12}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flinn conveyed the land to Blocker for $6,400 in 1840. A small community initially known as Cowpens sprang up in the early 1840s. The name was changed to Watson's Crossroads in 1842. In 1846, when a post office was established, the name was changed again to Olive Branch. Mrs. Frances Wilson Blocker, a descendant of one the community's founders, suggested the name as a way to symbolize the biblical story of a dove bringing a branch to Noah. With the exception of a few skirmishes occurring in an area southwest of the community, Olive Branch escaped much of the destruction and violence during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Our History&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dates&quot;/&gt;

Olive Branch was incorporated as a town on May 1, 1874. Ben Wesson was elected as the first mayor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wesson House&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.olivebrancholdtowne.com/wesson.php | title = Wesson House | format = | work = | publisher = Olive Branch Old Towne Association | date = | accessdate = 2009-07-12}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the first census conducted after incorporation in 1880, the population was 73. A railroad line was built through Olive Branch in 1885, connecting the town to [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] and [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]]. The town was officially designated a village on March 6, 1888.&lt;ref name=&quot;Our History&quot;/&gt;

At the turn of the century, nearly 200 people lived in Olive Branch. In the ensuing years, several modern amenities were introduced in the village, including the first cotton gin (1910), a public water system (1922), and electrical service (1927).&lt;ref name=&quot;Dates&quot;/&gt; T.H. Norvell's cheese plant (at the side of present-day [[BancorpSouth]]) opened in 1929, becoming the first major industry in Olive Branch. A public sewer system was built and local streets were paved [[circa]] 1940. The village experienced modest growth during the next few decades, rising from 441 in the 1940 census, to 534 in 1950, and 642 in 1960. Growth accelerated in the 1960s and by 1970, the population had more than doubled to 1,513. In 1971, a site located a few miles from downtown Olive Branch was chosen as the home of [[Holiday Inn]] University and Conference Center. Simultaneous with construction of the University, Holiday Inn began work on a {{convert|3000|acre|km2|adj=on}} industrial park. This was followed by the opening of [[Olive Branch Airport]] in January 1973. With a runway length of {{convert|6000|ft|m}}, it is currently one of Mississippi's five most active airports for landings and takeoffs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.olivebranchms.com/OliveBranch/History/tabid/105/Default.aspx | title = History | format = | work = | publisher = Olive Branch Chamber of Commerce | date = | accessdate = 2009-07-12}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[U.S. Route 78|U.S. Highway 78]] was built through Olive Branch in 1974. Such developments and infrastructure improvements brought an influx of jobs, industries, and people to DeSoto County and Olive Branch.

The 1990s were a period of explosive growth in the city; 3,567 people lived in Olive Branch at the 1990 census. In 1996, a land annexation to the west doubled the city's total land area.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dates&quot;/&gt; By 2000, the population had risen to 21,054, a 490 percent increase over the 1990 figure.

'''Southaven''', a city in [[DeSoto County, Mississippi]], is a suburb of [[Memphis, Tennessee]].  As of the [[United States Census, 2000|2000 census]], the city population was 28,977.  The 2010 census reflected a population of 48,982, making Southaven the fourth largest city in Mississippi.  Southaven is traversed from north to south by the [[Interstate 55|I-55 freeway]]. While its name would indicate otherwise, the city of Southaven is actually in the northwesternmost corner of Mississippi. The name derives from the fact that Southaven is located south of [[Whitehaven, Memphis]].

==Sports==
Southaven hosts the [[Southern Professional Hockey League]] team, the [[Mississippi RiverKings]], who play at the [[Lander's Center]]. The team relocated from Memphis prior to the 2000-2001 season and has been the main tenant of the Lander's Center since.

==History==
Southaven began as Memphis homebuilder [[Kemmons Wilson]] (founder of [[Holiday Inn]]) developed a few residential subdivisions featuring small starter homes just inside the Mississippi border from [[Whitehaven, Memphis|Whitehaven, Tennessee]], an unincorporated suburb of Memphis. Whitehaven was eventually annexed by Memphis. Southaven is one of the fastest growing cities in the southeast United States.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} In just 20 years, Southaven doubled its land area while its population tripled. Like the rest of Desoto County, Southaven's growth has been attributed mostly to the [[white flight]] from Memphis, though the percentage of blacks has risen sharply since the 2000 census resulting from [[black flight]].

Southaven was the boyhood home of noted novelist [[John Grisham]], who also practiced law there for almost a decade, and of singer and songwriter [[Cory Branan]].

==Weather==
Southaven experiences a [[humid subtropical climate]], with average annual precipitation of nearly 55&amp;nbsp;inches, which is well distributed throughout the year. April is the wettest month of the year, and August the driest. The average daily temperature is 40°F in January and 82°F in July.

In 2002, Baptist Hospital-DeSoto added an [[Ambulatory care|Outpatient Diagnostic Center]] and a Women's Center. In November 2006, Baptist DeSoto opened an eleven-story hospital tower that added 140 beds to the facility, allowing it to offer all private rooms. In addition, the new hospital tower added a new and expanded [[Emergency Department]], more operating suites and space for future additions. It is the first high-rise building constructed in Desoto County.

Recovery efforts went on for nearly a decade. The town later erected a plaque commemorating the efforts of the volunteers who committed time and resources towards rebuilding.

==Hurricane Katrina==
[[Image:WavelandKatrina.jpg|thumb|Waveland, Mississippi during [[Hurricane Katrina]], August 2005]]

The city of Waveland, Mississippi was &quot;ground zero&quot; of [[Hurricane Katrina]]'s landfall on August 29, 2005. The city received massive damage and is still in the process of recovering and rebuilding. South of the CSX railroad, the area was almost completely destroyed. The rest of the city took heavy flooding. In a news report, state officials said Waveland took a harder hit from the wind and water than any other town along the Gulf Coast, and that the town was obliterated. Thirty-six years earlier, in 1969, Waveland had been severely damaged by [[Hurricane Camille]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sciencepolicy.colorado.edu/about_us/meet_us/roger_pielke/camille/report.html |title=Hurricane Camille Report |publisher=Sciencepolicy.colorado.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Official reports stated that approximately 50 people died when Waveland was hit directly by the eyewall of Katrina and the {{convert|26|ft|m|adj=on}} storm surge.  Hurricane Katrina came ashore during the high tide of 8:01AM, +2.2 feet more.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;2005 NOAA Tide Predictions: Waveland&quot; (2005), tide on 29-August-2005, ''NOAA'', web: [http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/get_predictions.shtml?year=2005&amp;stn=0551+South+Pass&amp;secstn=Waveland&amp;thh=%2b3&amp;thm=9&amp;tlh=%2b2&amp;tlm=49&amp;hh=*1.28&amp;hl=*1.28 NOAA-tide-tables]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hurricane Katrina damaged over 40 Mississippi libraries, gutting the Waveland Public Library, as a total loss, requiring a complete rebuild.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hurricane Katrina Related Damages to Public Libraries in Mississippi|date=September 2005|publisher=Mississippi Library Commission|url=http://www.ala.org/ala/cro/katrina/MSPL_Katrina_Damage.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recovery===
[[Image:Waveland City Hall Camille.jpg|thumb|Waveland, Mississippi City Hall plaque to Hurricane Camille recovery volunteers, photo taken July 2006]]

A group of social activists seeking to better the lives of local residents, called the &quot;[[Rainbow Family]]&quot;, arrived in Waveland soon after Hurricane Katrina. From early September to early December 2005, they ran the &quot;[[New Waveland Cafe &amp; Clinic]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://newwavelandcafe.blogspot.com/ ]{{dead link|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5025313 |title=Hippie Kitchens Serve Final Meal to Hurricane Victims |publisher=NPR |date=2005-11-23 |accessdate=2013-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; located in the parking lot of Fred's Dept Store on Highway 90. The café provided free hot meals three times a day. The clinic was staffed by volunteer doctors and nurses from throughout the United States who saw over 5000 patients during the duration, free of charge and dispensing free medications. Donations of medications and supplies came from a multitude of sources, with International Aid&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalaid.org/ |title=International Aid |publisher=International Aid |date=2013-04-22 |accessdate=2013-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; arranging the most donations. This was the first experience of the counter-culture Rainbow Family in running a disaster relief center. The Bastrop Christian Outreach Center also volunteered with the Rainbow Family.

Waveland Elementary School, which has served public school students in Grades K-3 (Grades 4-5 attend Second Street Elementary in nearby Bay St. Louis), was heavily damaged by Katrina. The students attending the school have been educated in portable classrooms, for the beginning of the 2006-2007 school year, pending a permanent solution.

The [[Silver Slipper Casino (Waveland)|Silver Slipper Casino]] opened on November 9, 2006.

'''Magnolia''' is a city in [[Pike County, Mississippi|Pike County]], [[Mississippi]]. The population was 2420 at the 2010 census. It is the [[county seat]] of Pike County{{GR|6}}, which lies within the [[McComb, Mississippi]] [[McComb micropolitan area|Micropolitan Statistical Area]].

==History==
[[File:Ansel H Prewitt (ca. 1870).jpg|left|thumb|100px|Ansel H. Prewett, founder of Magnolia, Mississippi, shown ca. 1870]]

Magnolia was founded in 1856 by Ansel H. Prewett, a local civic leader and cotton planter. Knowing that the approaching [[New Orleans]], [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]], and Great Northern Railroad (now the [[Illinois Central Railroad]]) would need a station for water and fuel, Prewett sold a right-of-way to the railroad company – for one dollar, according to legend – and divided a section of his plantation into town lots, which he sold to investors. Prewett, while serving as temporary sheriff of Pike County, was killed by outlaws in the early 1870s escorting a prisoner on the very railroad that made Magnolia a viable community.&lt;ref&gt;Martha Lacy Hall, ''An Historical Sketch of Magnolia, Mississippi:  Centennial Celebration, Magnolia, Mississippi, 1856-1956''.  Magnolia, Mississippi:  W. M. Lacy, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;

Magnolia grew rapidly in the 1860s, and in the late nineteenth century Magnolia served as a popular small-town [[resort]] for wealthy New Orleanians, who took trains north from New Orleans to enjoy Magnolia's fresh air and sparkling creeks. At one time early Magnolia boasted an [[opera house]], [[ice rink|skating rink]], and several [[hotels]] that catered largely to these tourists.

In 1860 Magnolia's first newspaper, the &quot;Grand Trunk Magnolian&quot;, was established by John Waddill.  It did not last the war and was succeeded by the establishment of the &quot;Magnolia Gazette&quot; by J.D. Burke in 1872.  The &quot;Magnolia Herald&quot; was established by Luke W. Conerly in 1875 and he continued as its proprietor and editor until 1878.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lukewardconerly.com''Pike County Mississippi 1798-1876 Pioneer Families and Confederate Soldiers''] by Luke W. Conerly 1909&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chief Tishomingo|Tishomingo]], chief of the Chickasaw, lived at old Carrollville but died at [[Little Rock, Arkansas]] in 1839 of smallpox [[Trail of Tears|while being moved west]] with his tribe. On March 16, 1942 two tornadoes, only twenty-five minutes apart, struck Baldwyn and killed 65 persons.

'''Pascagoula''' is a city in [[Jackson County, Mississippi|Jackson County]], [[Mississippi]]. It is the principal city of the Pascagoula, Mississippi [[Pascagoula metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]], as a part of the [[Gulfport, Mississippi|Gulfport]]–[[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]]–Pascagoula, Mississippi [[Gulfport-Biloxi-Pascagoula combined statistical area|Combined Statistical Area]]. The population was 26,200 at the 2000 census. It is the [[county seat]] of [[Jackson County, Mississippi|Jackson County]]{{GR|6}}.

Pascagoula is a major industrial city of [[Mississippi]], along the [[Gulf Coast]]. Prior to World War II, the town was a sleepy fishing village of only about 5,000. The population exploded with the war-driven shipbuilding industry. Although the city's population seemed to peak in the late 1970s and early 1980s as [[Cold War]] defense spending was at its height, Pascagoula experienced some new growth and development in the years before [[Hurricane Katrina]]. Today, Pascagoula is home to the state’s largest employer, [[Ingalls Shipbuilding]], owned by [[Huntington Ingalls Industries]]. Other major industries include one of the largest Chevron refineries in the country; [[Signal International]], an oil platform builder; and [[Mississippi Phosphates]].

[[Naval Station Pascagoula]] was located on Singing River Island, and was homeport to several Navy warships, as well as a large [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] contingent. However, Naval Station Pascagoula was decommissioned as part of the 2005 [[Base Realignment and Closure|BRAC]] recommendations and ceased operations in 2006.

The city is served by three airports: [[Mobile Regional Airport]], which is located in nearby [[Mobile, Alabama]]; the [[Gulfport-Biloxi International Airport]], about {{convert|40|mi|km}} west of Pascagoula; and the [[Trent Lott International Airport]], located within Jackson County.

The mayor of the city is [[Robbie Maxwell]].

==History==

===Native residents===
The name ''Pascagoula'', which means &quot;bread eater&quot;, is taken from a group of Native Americans found in villages along the [[Pascagoula River]] some distance above its mouth. [[Hernando De Soto (explorer)|Hernando De Soto]] seems to have made first contact with them in the 1540s, though little is known of that encounter. [[Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville]], founder of the colony of [[Louisiana]], left a more detailed account from an expedition of this region in 1700. The first detailed account comes from [[Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville]], younger brother of Iberville, whom the Pascagoula visited at [[Fort Maurepas]] in present-day [[Ocean Springs]], shortly after it was settled and while the older brother was away in France. There are few details that are certain about these peoples, except that their language seemed not to have shared an [[etymological]] root with the larger native groups to the north, the [[Choctaw]] particularly. Instead, their language seems more akin to that of the [[Biloxi tribe|Biloxi]] or [[Natchez people]], both of whom have been linked in this way to the [[Sioux]], [[Crow Nation|Crow]], and [[Ho-Chunk]]. The territory of the Biloxi peoples seems to have ranged from the areas of what are now called Biloxi Bay to [[Bayou La Batre]] ([[Alabama]]) and twenty-five miles up the [[Pascagoula River]], and then the Pascagoula people's territory seems to have ranged between some distance north of there to the confluence of the [[Leaf River (Mississippi)|Leaf]] and [[Chickasawhay River|Chickasawhay]] rivers.&lt;ref&gt;Cain, Cyril Edward: &quot;Four Centuries on the Pascagoula&quot;, vol. 1, pages 19–21. 1953&lt;/ref&gt;

The first settlers of Pascagoula were Jean Baptiste Baudreau Dit Graveline, Joseph Simon De La Pointe and his aunt, the Madame Chaumont

Local legend says the Pascagoula tribe chanted and waded hand-in-hand into the [[Pascagoula River]], drowning together rather than become enslaved and killed to an enemy tribe, the [[Biloxi]]. Thus, the legend of the &quot;Singing River&quot; was born. It is said that on still summer and autumn evenings, the sad song of the Pascagoulas can still be heard near the river.

===Modern history===

The region changed hands over the next century, being occupied variously by the English, French, and Spanish until well after the [[American Revolutionary War]]. It did not come into the permanent possession of the United States until 1812, when it was added to the [[Mississippi Territory]]. At one point, for seventy-four days in 1810, Pascagoula was a part of what was known as [[West Florida|The Republic of West Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;Ibid., 47–49&lt;/ref&gt;  Pascagoula was incorporated as a village in 1892 and obtained city status in 1901. Today's downtown Pascagoula used to be the town of Scranton, Mississippi (incorporated in 1870) until the two towns merged in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paslodge419.org/LodgeHistory.htm Pascagoula Lodge #419 F. &amp; A. M.: History of Pascagoula Lodge #419 F. &amp; A. M.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Pascagoula has been home or host to many notable people, including the pirate [[Jean Lafitte]]; the infamous Copeland Gang; “Old Hickory” [[Andrew Jackson]]; General (later President) [[Zachary Taylor]]; Confederate General and Congressman [[David Emanuel Twiggs]]; Union Admiral [[David Farragut]]; [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]], who is said to have penned &quot;The Building of a Ship&quot; while in Pascagoula (although his stay is more local folklore than truth); and [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Laureate]] in literature [[William Faulkner]] who is believed to have written &quot;Mosquitoes&quot; while summering in Pascagoula. The world renowned rhythm and blues band, [[The Nite Riders]], also got their start in Pascagoula in the 1950s. Many of the original members still perform together in local casinos.

Pascagoula gained notoriety on October 11, 1973 when two local fishermen, Charles Hickson and Calvin Parker, claimed to have been [[Pascagoula Abduction|abducted]] by aliens from a Pascagoula pier. The media frenzy that followed touched off national interest in UFOs and extraterrestrials unparalleled since the [[Roswell UFO incident|Roswell incident]]. In 1983, Hickson wrote a book about his ordeal entitled ''UFO Contact In Pascagoula.''

Pascagoula also gained national attention in the 1980s, when novelty singer/songwriter [[Ray Stevens]] featured the town in his hit, &quot;Mississippi Squirrel Revival.&quot; Stevens admits, though, that the song could have been set in any Southern town but the name Pascagoula easily rhymed with the word, hallelujah, which is heard frequently in the song. This is also the spot where a little girl was found thrown into the Dog River on Dec. 5, 1982. The girl, thought to be between 18 months and two years old, has never been identified to this day. The unidentified toddler is buried in Jackson County Memorial Park. Deputy Moore and his wife stepped forward and made sure the little girl was given a proper funeral and burial in 1982. Approximately 200 people attended the young girl's funeral.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wlox.com/Global/story.asp?S=7467928 WLOX TV 13 – The Station for South Mississippi – Local news, weather, sports, jobs, and entertainment – Gulfport, Biloxi, Pascagoula | Unidentified Baby Still Remembered After 25 Years&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gulflive.com/news/mississippipress/index.ssf?/base/news/1197199083132970.xml Memorial participants hope to identify Baby Jane'&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.missingkids.com/missingkids/servlet/PubCaseSearchServlet?act=viewChildDetail&amp;caseNum=400053&amp;orgPrefix=NCMU&amp;seqNum=1&amp;caseLang=en_US&amp;searchLang=en_US National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.picayuneitem.com/local/local_story_341150430.html The Picayune Item – 25 years later, ‘Baby Jane’ still a mystery&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most homes along Beach Boulevard were destroyed, and [[FEMA trailer]]s are now an omnipresent sight.  Due to the major media focus on the plight of New Orleans and Biloxi-Gulfport in the aftermath of Katrina, many Pascagoula citizens have expressed feeling neglected or even forgotten following the storm.  Most Pascagoula residents did not possess flood insurance, and many were required to put their homes on pilings before being given a permit to rebuild.

[[United States Navy]] officials announced that two [[Arleigh Burke class destroyer|''Arleigh Burke''-class]] [[guided missile]] [[destroyer]]s that were under construction at [[Northrop Grumman Ship Systems]] in Pascagoula had been damaged by the storm, as well as the [[Amphibious assault ship]] [[USS Makin Island (LHD-8)|USS ''Makin Island'']].

Hurricane Katrina damaged over forty Mississippi libraries, flooding the Pascagoula Public Library, first floor, and causing mold in the building.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Hurricane Katrina Related Damages to Public Libraries in Mississippi&quot; (September 2005), Mississippi Library Commission, web:[http://www.ala.org/ala/cro/katrina/MSPL_Katrina_Damage.pdf ALA-Katrina].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ocean Springs''' is a city in [[Jackson County, Mississippi|Jackson County]], [[Mississippi]], about {{convert|2|mi|km}} east of [[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]]. It is part of the [[Pascagoula, Mississippi]] [[Pascagoula metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]]. The population was 17,225 at the 2000 U.S. Census. As of the 2010 U.S. Census, the city of Ocean Springs had a population of 23,161.

The town has a reputation as an arts community. Its historic and secluded downtown area, with streets lined by live oak trees, is home to several art galleries and shops. It is also home to a number of ethnic restaurants relatively uncommon in surrounding communities.

Ocean Springs was the hometown of the late [[Walter Inglis Anderson]], a nationally renowned painter and muralist who died in 1965 from lung cancer. The town plays host to several festivals, including its Peter Anderson Festival and The Herb Festival.

Ocean Springs was severely damaged on August 29, 2005, by [[Hurricane Katrina]], which destroyed many buildings along the shoreline, including the Ocean Springs Yacht Club, and the historic wooden [[Fort Maurepas]], and gutted or flooded other buildings. Katrina's {{convert|25|ft|m|abbr=on}} storm surge also destroyed the Biloxi Bay Bridge, which connected [[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]] to Ocean Springs.&lt;ref name=CNN360Tuchman29&gt;Gary Tuchman, Transcript of &quot;Anderson Cooper 360 Degrees&quot; (2006-08-29) 19:00 ET, ''CNN'', CNN.com web: [http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0508/29/acd.01.html CNN-ACooper082906]: GARY TUCHMAN, CNN Correspondent: Responds to Anderson Cooper that it felt like it would never end, saying winds were at least 100 miles per hour in Gulfport for seven hours, between about 7:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. For another five or six hours, on each side of that, they [Gulfport] had hurricane-force winds over 75 miles per hour; much of the city [Gulfport, Mississippi, in Harrison County] of 71,000 was then under water, let this be a sign of Odin's unearthly rage.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Shrimpboats.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Ocean Springs shrimp boats in February 2008.]]
The settlement of Fort Maurepas or Old Biloxi, in colonial French Louisiana (New France), began in April 1699 at present-day Ocean Springs, under the authority of King Louis XIV, as [[Fort Maurepas]] by [[Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville]]. It was the first permanent French outpost in [[Louisiana (New France)|French Louisiana]] and was established as a foothold to prevent Spanish encroachment on France's colonial claims. The site was maintained well into the early 18th century.

The name Ocean Springs was coined by Dr. William Glover Austin in 1854. He believed the local springs had healing qualities. Ocean Springs became a prosperous resort town and after several years reinvented itself as a history oriented residential community. The history of the town is celebrated annually in reenactments depicting d'Iberville's landing near a replica of Fort Maurepas.

From colonial times to present day, seafood has been celebrated. The abundance of seafood allowed French and French-Canadian explorers and settlers to thrive within the Fort Maurepas/Old Biloxi area. In the late nineteenth century, the development of ice plant industries along the coast increased seafood sales. Locals and tourists can still purchase freshly harvested shrimp, fish, crabs, and oysters to this day because of this thriving industry.

Ocean Springs was in the international spotlight following Hurricane Katrina's landfall on August 29, 2005. The city, part of the Mississippi Gulf Coast directly hit by the storm, sustained significant damage. The Biloxi-Ocean Springs bridge, part of Highway 90 along the beach, was destroyed and was a widely broadcast visual testament to the hurricane's impact.

===Biloxi Bay Bridge===
[[Hurricane Katrina]]'s {{convert|28|ft|m|sing=on}} storm surge destroyed the Biloxi Bay Bridge, which connected [[Biloxi]] to [[Ocean Springs]]. The bridge was completed in 1962, and damaged in 1969 by [[Hurricane Camille]]. The Biloxi Bay Bridge replaced the aging [[War Memorial Bridge]] which opened in 1930. As of 2007, the majority of the bridge's remains have been removed via cranes based on [[barges]] located next to the bridge debris. The bridge ruins, capturing the breathtaking results of the force of [[Hurricane Katrina]], had become a popular spot of photographers both professional and amateur. The construction for the new bridge was completed in April 2008. The new Biloxi Bay Bridge is 95' in height at its main span, and supports six lanes of traffic. Two lanes of the six-lane bridge opened November 1, 2007. The new bridge has a curving roadway due to the implemented [[design-build]] process. In order to speed the process of rebuilding, the main body of the bridge was moved outside of the previous bridge's debris area. The landing points for each side of [[U.S. Route 90]] correspond with the previous bridge.

'''Wiggins''' is a city in [[Stone County, Mississippi|Stone County]], [[Mississippi]], [[United States]]. It is part of the [[Gulfport, Mississippi|Gulfport]]&amp;ndash;[[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]], Mississippi [[Gulfport-Biloxi metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]]. The population was 4,390 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. It is the [[county seat]] of [[Stone County, Mississippi|Stone County]]{{GR|6}}.

==History==
[[Image:G&amp;SIRR Depot Wiggins.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Wiggins, MS business district and railroad depot before the 1910 fire]]
Wiggins is named after Wiggins Hatten, the father of Madison Hatten, one of the area's original homesteaders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stonecounty.com/wiggins_history.htm Stone County Economic Development Partnership: City of Wiggins, History.]&lt;/ref&gt;  It was incorporated in 1904, and the 1910 census reported 980 residents.  In the early 1900s, Wiggins prospered along with the booming timber industry.  Wiggins was once headquarters of the [[Finkbine-Guild Lumber Company|Finkbine Lumber Company]].
[[Image:AmericanPickleCompany.jpg|thumb|200px|left|American Pickle and Canning Co., Wiggins, MS, circa 1910]]
On January 21, 1910, between the hours of 11 am and 1 pm, more than half of the Wiggins business district was destroyed by fire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.gendisasters.com/mississippi/7979/wiggins-ms-fire-jan-1910 Wiggins fire.]&lt;/ref&gt;  The fire started from unknown origin in the Hammock Building, a lodging house, and spread rapidly because of strong winds from the northwest.  With no city fire department or waterworks, the residents of Wiggins resorted to bucket brigades and dynamite to stop the fire, which was confined to the east side of the [[Gulf and Ship Island Railroad]].  The fire consumed 41 business establishments, including the Gulf and Ship Island Railroad depot.  Only two or three residential dwellings were destroyed, because most homes were built away from the business district.

Wiggins has long been known for its pickle production, and at one time boasted of being home to the world's largest pickle processing facility.&lt;ref&gt;Kat Bergeron. 2012. Green Gold: The story of the Wiggins pickle. ''[[Sun Herald]]'' (Biloxi, MS), Vol. 128, No. 230, Page 8F, May 20, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the pickle processing facility is now closed, and although the timber industry has declined since the boom years, it still sustains many businesses in Wiggins.

===Historic Pine Hill===
After the 1910 fire and until the 1960s, the center of commerce for Wiggins developed on both sides of Pine Street, that sloped downhill and eastward, perpendicular to [[U.S. Route 49]] and Railroad Street (First Street), over a distance of one city block.  Small shops were built mainly of brick and were mostly contiguous to each other.  Over the years, the shops were occupied by numerous businesses that included [[Pharmacy|drug stores]], law offices, a grocery store, a shoe store, a dry cleaners, [[Variety store|5 &amp; dime]] stores, auto supply store, barber shops, cafes, a movie theater, dry goods outlet, feed &amp; seed outlet, an army surplus store, beauty salons, clothing stores, gift shops, County Library, and [[United States Postal Service|U.S. Post Office]].  In more recent years, the shops have served as real estate offices, [[Certified Public Accountant|CPA]] &amp; tax preparer outlets, an antique store, newspaper office, ice cream shop, art &amp; frame shop, food outlets, and stationery shop.  

In the late 1960s, U.S. Route 49 bypassed the downtown area, and many businesses moved from Pine Hill to other locations within the City.  The old Wiggins High School and Elementary School buildings occupied a city block, situated at the base of Pine Hill.  When the school buildings were demolished in the 1970s, the school land was dedicated to City use as Blaylock Park.  In the 1980s, City and County business leaders saw a need for developing a sense of community and tourism by initiating an annual Pine Hill Day, which later became Pine Hill Festival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stonecounty.com/edp_home.htm Pine Hill Festival] retrieved April 24, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; During Pine Hill Day, area residents offered items for sale as arts &amp; crafts, in farmers' markets, and as local cuisine.  To attract more visitors, other venues such as live music entertainment, competitive foot races, antique vehicle displays, commercial food vendors, and games for kids were added through the years, and the festival became a Spring event.  In 2012, an estimated 11,000 people attended the 2-day festival.&lt;ref&gt;Nicole Dow. 2012. Festival attracts record crowds. ''[[Sun Herald]]'' (Biloxi, MS), March 25, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hattiesburg''' is a city in [[Mississippi]], bisected by the county line between [[Forrest County, Mississippi|Forrest County]] (where it is the [[county seat]]{{GR|6}}) and [[Lamar County, Mississippi|Lamar County]]. The population was 45,989 in the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].&lt;ref&gt;United States Census Bureau [http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/28/2831020.html]. Retrieved 2012-07-31.&lt;/ref&gt; 
It is the principal city of the [[Hattiesburg metropolitan area|Hattiesburg, Mississippi, Metropolitan Statistical Area]] which encompasses Forrest, Lamar and [[Perry County, Mississippi|Perry]] counties.

Founded in 1882 by pioneer lumberman and civil engineer [[William H. Hardy]], Hattiesburg was named in honor of Hardy's wife Hattie. The town was incorporated two years later with a population of 400. Hattiesburg's population first expanded as a center of the lumber and railroad industries, from which was derived the nickname &quot;The Hub City.&quot; It now attracts newcomers to the area because of the diversity of the economy, strong neighborhoods and the central location in South Mississippi.

Hattiesburg is home to [[The University of Southern Mississippi]] (originally known as Mississippi Normal College) and [[William Carey University]] (formerly William Carey College). South of Hattiesburg is [[Camp Shelby]], the largest [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] training base east of the [[Mississippi River]].

== History ==
Previously inhabited by the [[Choctaw]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], the area now called Hattiesburg was obtained by the United States under the terms of the [[Treaty of Mount Dexter]] in 1805. After the treaty was ratified, [[European-American]] settlers began to move into the area.

Hattiesburg is positioned at the fork of the [[Leaf River (Mississippi)|Leaf]] and [[Bouie River|Bouie]] Rivers, and was founded in 1882 by Captain [[William H. Hardy]], a civil engineer. Early settlers to the area were of [[Scotland|Scottish]], [[Northern Ireland|Scots-Irish]], and [[England|English]] descent who came from Georgia and the Carolinas, attracted by the vast area of virgin pine timberlands.

The city of Hattiesburg was incorporated in 1884 with a population of approximately 400. Originally called Twin Forks and later Gordonville, Hardy gave the city its final name of Hattiesburg, in honor of his wife Hattie.

Also in 1884, a railroad — known then as the [[New Orleans and Northeastern Railroad|New Orleans and Northeastern]] — was built from [[Meridian, Mississippi]], through Hattiesburg to [[New Orleans]]. The completion of the [[Gulf and Ship Island Railroad]] (G&amp;SIRR) from [[Gulfport, Mississippi]], to [[Jackson, Mississippi]], ran through Hattiesburg and ushered in the real lumber boom in 1897. Though it was 20 years in the building, the G&amp;SIRR more than fulfilled its promise. It gave the state a deep water harbor, more than doubled the population of towns along its route, built the City of Gulfport and made Hattiesburg a railroad center.  In 1924, the G&amp;SIRR operated as a subsidiary of the Illinois Central Railroad but lost its independent identity in 1946.

Hattiesburg gained its nickname, the Hub City, in 1912 as a result of a contest in a local newspaper. This suggestion came because the city was the intersection of a number of important rail lines. Later the city also became the intersection of state highways [[U.S. Highway 49]], [[U.S. Highway 98]] and [[U.S. Highway 11]], and later, Interstate 59. Hattiesburg is centrally located less than 100 miles from the state capital of Jackson as well as the [[Mississippi Gulf Coast]], [[New Orleans]] and [[Mobile, Alabama]].&lt;ref&gt;Reagan L. Grimsley, Hattiesburg In Vintage Postcards, (SC: Arcadia Publishing, 2004.)&lt;/ref&gt;

The region around Hattiesburg was involved in the [[nuclear arms race]] of the [[Cold War]].  In the 1960s, two nuclear devices were detonated in the salt domes near [[Lumberton, Mississippi]], about 28 miles southwest of Hattiesburg.  Extensive follow-up of the area by the EPA has not revealed levels of nuclear contamination in the area that would be harmful to humans.

Throughout the 20th Century, Hattiesburg benefited from the founding of [[Camp Shelby]] (now a military mobilization center), two major hospitals, and two colleges, [[The University of Southern Mississippi]] and [[William Carey University]]. The growing metropolitan area that includes Hattiesburg, [[Forrest County, Mississippi|Forrest]] and [[Lamar County, Mississippi|Lamar]] Counties, was designated a [[Metropolitan Statistical Area]] in 1994 with a combined population of more than 100,000 residents.&lt;ref&gt;Reagan L. Grimsley, Hattiesburg in Vintage Postcards, Arcadia Publishing, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite being about {{convert|75|mi|km}} inland, Hattiesburg was hit very hard in 2005 by [[Hurricane Katrina]]. Around 10,000 structures in the area received major damage of some type. Approximately 80 percent of the city's roads were blocked by trees and power was out in the area for up to 14 days. The storm killed 24 people in Hattiesburg and the surrounding areas. The city is strained by a large influx of temporary evacuees and new permanent residents from coastal Louisiana and Mississippi towns to the south, where damage from Katrina was catastrophic.

The City is also known for its police department, as it was the first — and for almost a decade the only — [[Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies]] federally accredited law enforcement agency in the State of Mississippi.  The department is serviced by its own training academy, which has traditionally been one of the most difficult basic academies in the country with over a 50% attrition rate.

The [[Hattiesburg Zoo]] at Kamper Park is a longstanding tourist attraction in the city.

In 2011, Hattiesburg was named one of [http://planning.org/greatplaces/neighborhoods/2011/index.htm#MS_ America's Great Places] by the American Planning Association.  APA's flagship program celebrates places of exemplary character, quality, and planning. Places are selected annually and represent the gold standard in terms of having a true sense of place, cultural and historical interest, community involvement, and a vision for tomorrow.APA Great Places offer better choices for where and how people work and live. They are enjoyable, safe, and desirable. They are places where people want to be — not only to visit, but to live and work every day. America's truly great streets, neighborhoods and public spaces are defined by many criteria, including architectural features, accessibility, functionality, and community involvement.  Hattiesburg is home to Southern charm and friendly neighbors who come together to help each other out.

The [http://www.misshospitality.com/index.html_ Miss Hospitality Pageant] began in 1949.  Hattiesburg received sponsorship of the state pageant in December 1997.  The purpose of the pageant is the identification and presentation of a young and knowledgeable lady to help promote the state in tourism and economic development.  Contestants are judged on the following categories: panel interview, one-on-one interview competition, Mississippi speech competition, commercial/black dress competition, and evening gown competition.  The 2011 winner was Ann Claire Reynolds who is a junior at University of Southern Mississippi majoring in elementary education and special education.

Hattiesburg is home to the [[African American Military History Museum]]. Opened in 1942 to serve African Americans serving at Camp Shelby and now on the National Registry of Historic Places.  The museum started out as a USO Club location and is the only remaining original club location left in the United States.  USO's mission statement is to lift the spirits of America's troops and their families.  Exhibits include: Revolutionary War, the Founding of Hattiesburg, Buffalo Soldiers, World Wars I and II, Desegregation, Korean War, Vietnam, Desert Storm, Global War on Terrorism, You Can Be A Soldier, Hattiesburg's Hall of Honor, and World Map.  The museum is dedicated to the African American soldiers that have fought for their country from Buffalo Soldiers to Operation Iraqi Freedom.

===Civil rights movement===
Hattiesburg and the unincorporated [[African American]] community of Palmers Crossing played a key role in the civil rights struggles of the 1960s. In 1959, black [[Korean War]] veteran [[Clyde Kennard]] applied to attend then all-white Mississippi Southern College (today [[University of Southern Mississippi]]). He was denied admission on account of his race, and when he persisted, the [[Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission]] conspired to have him framed for a crime, for which he was sentenced to seven years in [[Mississippi State Penitentiary|Parchman Prison]]. For years, [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] leaders [[Medgar Evers]], [[Vernon Dahmer]] and other Forrest County civil rights activists fought to overturn the conviction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis59.htm#1959kennard Clyde Kennard Framed and Jailed in MS] ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:March, King, April 8, 1968..jpg|thumb|right|Memorial march in Hattiesburg, four days after Martin Luther King's death]]

Forrest County Registrar Theron Lynd prevented blacks from registering to vote. Thirty percent of the population was black, but less than 1% of them were on the voting rolls, while white registration was close to 100%. In 1961, the U.S. [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] filed suit against Lynd and he became the first southern registrar to be convicted under the [[Civil Rights Act of 1957]] for systematically violating African American voting rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.usm.edu/~archives/m027.htm?m027text.htm~mainFrame United States of America vs. Theron C. Lynd] - University of Southern Mississippi&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] began one of its first voter-registration projects in Hattiesburg under the auspices of [[Council of Federated Organizations]]). By 1964, the [[Delta Ministry]] was active in the city. In cooperation with the NAACP and local civil rights leaders, they formed the Forrest County Voters League.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.usm.edu/~archives/crsitdoc.htm Historic Sites of the Civil Rights Movement in Hattiesburg] - University of Southern Mississippi&lt;/ref&gt; In conjunction with the 1963 elections, civil rights leaders organized a statewide &quot;Freedom Ballot,&quot; a mock election that demonstrated both the state-wide pattern of voting rights discrimination and the strong desire of Mississippi blacks for full citizenship. Despite the serious risk of both physical and economic retaliation, almost half of Forrest County blacks participated, the highest turnout in the state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crmvet.org/tim/tim63b.htm#1963msballot Freedom Ballot in MS] ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans&lt;/ref&gt;

January 21, 1964, was &quot;Freedom Day&quot; in Hattiesburg, a major voter registration effort supported by student demonstrators and 50 northern clergymen. For the first time since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], an inter-racial protest was allowed to picket the courthouse for voting rights without being arrested. Roughly 100 African Americans attempted to register, though only a few were allowed into the courthouse and fewer still were added to the rolls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis64.htm#1964hburg Freedom Day in Hattiesburg] ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans&lt;/ref&gt; Each day thereafter for many months the courthouse protest was resumed in what became known as the &quot;Perpetual Picket.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

During [[Freedom Summer]] in 1964, the Hattiesburg/Palmers Crossing project was the headquarters for all civil rights activity in the 5th Congressional District and the largest and most active site in the state with more than 90 volunteers and 3,000 local participants. Hundreds of Forrest County blacks tried to register to vote at the courthouse, but most were prevented from doing so. More than 650 children and adults attended one of the seven [[Freedom Schools]] in Hattiesburg and Palmers Crossing, three freedom libraries were set up with donated books, and a community center was established. Many whites opposed civil rights efforts by blacks, and both summer volunteers and local African Americans endured arrests, beatings, firings, and evictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Forrest County was also a center of activity for the [[Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party]] (MFDP) which sent a slate of delegates to the Democratic Convention in Atlantic City to challenge the seating of the all-white, pro-segregation delegates elected by the regular party in primaries in which African Americans could not participate. [[Victoria Gray Adams|Victoria Jackson Gray]] of Palmers Crossing ran on the MFDP ticket against incumbent Senator [[John C. Stennis|John Stennis]] and John Cameron of Hattiesburg ran for Representative in the 5th District. With blacks still denied the vote, they knew they could not be elected, but their candidacies and campaigns advanced the struggle for voting rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

On the night of January 10, 1966, the [[White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan]] attacked the Hattiesburg home of NAACP leader Vernon Dahmer with firebombs and gunfire. Dahmer was the most prominent black leader in the county and been the primary civil rights leader for many years. Just prior to the attack, he had announced that he would help pay a $2 poll tax for black voters too poor to do so themselves. Dahmer held off the Klan with his rifle to give his wife, their three young children, and elderly aunt time to escape their burning home, but he died of burns and smoke inhalation the next day. His murder sparked large protest marches in Hattiesburg. A number of Klansmen were arrested for the crime and four were eventually convicted. After four previous trials had ended in deadlocks, KKK Imperial Wizard [[Samuel Bowers]] was finally convicted in August 1998 for ordering the assassination of Dahmer. He was sentenced to life in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Vela Uniform/Project Dribble nuclear tests===
[[Vela Uniform]] was an element of [[Project Vela]] conducted jointly by the [[United States Department of Energy]] and the [[Advanced Research Projects Agency]].  Its purpose was to develop [[seismic]] methods for detecting [[underground nuclear testing]]. The Project Dribble program involved two nuclear detonations. Test SALMON occurred on October 22, 1964, with a 5.3 kiloton yield; test STERLING was detonated December 3, 1966, with a yield of 380 tons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nv.doe.gov/library/publications/historical/DOENV_209_REV15.pdf | title = United States Nulear Tests: July 1945 through September 1992 | publisher = [[US Department of Energy]] Nevada Operations Office | date = 2000-12 | accessdate = 2008-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both detonations took place within Tatum Salt Dome, southwest of the Hattiesburg/[[Purvis, Mississippi|Purvis]] area.

'''Clinton''' is a [[List of cities in Mississippi|city]] in [[Hinds County, Mississippi|Hinds County]], [[Mississippi]], United States. Situated in the [[Jackson, Mississippi metropolitan area|Jackson metropolitan area]], it is the tenth largest city in Mississippi. The population was 25,216 at the [[United States Census, 2010|2010 United States Census]].&lt;ref name=&quot;2010 Census&quot;/&gt;

==History==
[[Image:OldTrace.jpg|left|thumb|Old Natchez Trace in 2002]][[Image:CampClintonGateThen.jpg|left|thumb|Camp Clinton entrance in 1943; sign reads Prisoner of War Camp Clinton, Miss.]]
Clinton, founded in 1823 was originally known as '''Mount Salus''', which means &quot;Mountain of health&quot;. Mount Salus was also the name of the home of [[Walter Leake]], third governor of Mississippi, which was located in Clinton and built in 1812. In 1828, the name was changed from Mount Salus to Clinton in honor of [[DeWitt Clinton]], the former governor of New York.
Clinton is also home to the &quot;Clinton Arrows&quot; and &quot;Mississippi College Choctaws&quot;.
The first road through Mount Salus/Clinton was the [[Natchez Trace]]. Currently Clinton has three major highways that pass through the city:[[U.S. Route 80]], [[Interstate 20]] and the Natchez Trace Parkway.

[[Mississippi College]], a [[Christian]] university located in Clinton, is the oldest college in the state of Mississippi, founded January 24, 1826. Mississippi College is the second oldest [[Baptist]] university in the world, and was also the first coeducational college in the United States to grant a degree to a woman. The [[Historically black colleges and universities|historically black]] [[Women's colleges in the United States|institution of higher education for women]], [[Mount Hermon Female Seminary]] was established in 1875 by [[Sarah Ann Dickey]]. It closed in 1924.

[[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] forces, as well as [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] troops—both under the command of [[Ulysses S. Grant]] and [[William Tecumseh Sherman|General Sherman]]—briefly occupied Clinton during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] on the way to the [[Battle of Vicksburg]] in May 1863. Grant, who scored a decisive victory at Vicksburg, mistakenly believed that [[John C. Pemberton]], a [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] [[General officer|general]], would attack him at Clinton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Mask of Command: A Study of Generalship|author=[[John Keegan]]|year=1987|isbn=1-84413-738-4|chapter=Grant and Unheroic Leadership|page=214|publisher=Pimlico ([[Random House]])}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1875, the Clinton Riot occurred in downtown Clinton during a political rally of about 3000 people. The riot was racially and politically motivated, related to the contemporary [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] movement under the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]-led U.S. government. Approximately 50 people were killed, mostly African-American, and all Republican. The lack of response from the U.S. government in retaliation signaled the beginning of the end of Reconstruction.

During World War II, [[Camp Clinton]] was established, a German POW camp south of town which housed about 3,000 German soldiers. Most of the prisoners were from the [[Afrika Korps]]. Of the 40 German generals captured in the war, Camp Clinton housed 35 of them. The German soldiers provided the labor to build a [[Mississippi River Basin Model|replica model of the Mississippi River Basin]] for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, used for flood prevention.

Clinton, the smallest city to ever host a [[Fortune 500]] company, was the headquarters for [[WorldCom]] from the mid-1990s until 2002. After its bankruptcy due to the largest accounting scandal at the time in U.S. history and fraud-related convictions of [[Bernard Ebbers]], [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] and [[Scott Sullivan (executive)|Scott Sullivan]], [[Chief financial officer|CFO]], it changed its name to [[MCI Inc.|MCI]] and moved its corporate headquarters location to [[Ashburn, Virginia]]. [[Verizon Communications|Verizon]], MCI's successor and which also owns SkyTel (no relation to [[Airfone|Bell Mobility]]'s Skytel brand), still occupy the massive former WorldCom compound in Clinton.

On April 15, 2011, an EF-4 tornado struck the city at around 11:00a.m.. This happened in the middle of the April 2011 tornado outbreak that spawned other tornadoes in Mississippi and Alabama. It produced damage near Interstate 20 which included total destruction to the BankPlus building. The tornado then headed east towards Jackson, Mississippi damaging many businesses and homes along Highway 80 East. The tornado caused multiple injuries, but no fatalities were recorded.

==Geography==
Clinton is located at {{Coord|32|20|30|N|90|19|18|W|region:US-MS_type:city}} (32.3415342, -90.3217585) and its elevation is {{convert|358|ft|m|0}} above sea level.&lt;ref name=&quot;GNIS&quot;&gt;{{cite GNIS|668609|Feature Detail Report for: Clinton (Hinds County, Mississippi)|accessdate=October 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[2010 United States Census]], the city has a total area of {{convert|42.147|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|41.822|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|0.325|sqmi|km2}} is water.&lt;ref name=&quot;2010 Census Gazetteer&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;United States Census Bureau&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = U.S. Census Bureau: State and County QuickFacts | url = http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/28/2814420.html | publisher = United States Census Bureau |accessdate = March 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The racial makeup of the city was 60.1% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 33.9% [[Black (U.S. Census)|Black]], 0.2% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 4.1% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], and 1.0% from two or more races. [[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]] of any race were 1.5% of the population. There was no information available on the percentage of the Clinton residents who identified themselves as Pacific Islander during the 2010 census.

In 2010, there were 9,328 households. The average household size in Clinton was 2.54.  The median income for a household in the city was $56,539; the [[per capita income]] was $26,398.  About 9.1% of the population was below the [[poverty line]].&lt;ref name=&quot;United States Census Bureau&quot;/&gt;

==Government==
Clinton operates as a Code Charter form of government, divided into six [[Wards of the United States|Wards]]. The local governing body consists of the [[mayor]], one [[Alderman]] representing each of the six Wards and one Alderman-at-Large whose duty is to represent the entire community.

As of August 2013, General (ret) Phil Fisher is the city's mayor. The Board of Alderman are Dave Ellis (Ward 1), Tony Greer (Ward 2), Bill Barnett (Ward 3), Greg Cronin (Ward 4), Jan Cossitt(Ward 5), Mike Cashion (Ward 6) and Jehu Brabham (Alderman-At-Large).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clintonms.org/city/government/aldermen/ Board of Alderman]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Clarksdale''' is a city in [[Coahoma County, Mississippi|Coahoma County]], [[Mississippi]], and seat of the county.{{GR|6}}  Located in the [[Mississippi Delta]] region, Clarksdale is an agricultural center, and has been home to many blues musicians.  Clarksdale is named after John Clark, who founded the town.

==History==

===Early history===
[[Choctaw]] and [[Chickasaw]] Indians occupied the Delta region prior to the arrival of European settlers, and the original site of Clarksdale was located on the former intersection of two important Indian routes: the Lower Creek Trade Paths which extended westward from Augusta, Georgia, to New Mexico; and the Chakchiuma Trade Trail which ran northeastward to old Pontotoc.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark House&quot;&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;  The first [[Indian removal|removal treaty]] carried out under the [[Indian Removal Act]] was the 1830 [[Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek]], which ceded about 11 million acres of the Choctaw Nation (now Mississippi) in exchange for about 15 million acres in Oklahoma. A similar removal of the Chickasaw Nation began in 1837 and once in Oklahoma, they paid the Choctaw $530,000 for the westernmost part of their land. 

Following the removal of the Indians, white settlers migrated to the Delta region, where the fertile soil was excellent for growing cotton.  Several cotton plantations were established in the Clarksdale area, and the town soon earned the title &quot;The Golden Buckle on the Cotton Belt&quot;.  John Clark founded the town in 1848 when he bought land in the area and started a timber business.  Clark was also brother-in-law to [[James L. Alcorn|James Lusk Alcorn]], who owned a nearby plantation, and went on to became a senator and then governor.

Clarksdale was incorporated in 1882, and in 1879, the [[Louisville, New Orleans and Texas Railway]] was built through Clarksdale.  In 1886, the town's streets were laid out, though it wasn't until 1913 that any were paved.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lemann&quot;&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

Fundamental to the Delta's cotton industry—at least until the 1940s—was the widespread exploitation of African-American laborers.  U.S. Census data shows Coahoma County's 1860 population at 1,521 whites and 5,085 slaves (with James Alcorn listed as owning 77).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

When slavery was abolished, it immediately gave rise to the economic institution known as [[sharecropping]], with its parallel political institution: segregation.  Historian Nicholas Lemann writes &quot;segregation strengthened the grip of the sharecropper system by ensuring that most blacks would have no arena of opportunity in life except for the cotton fields&quot; (p.&amp;nbsp;6).&lt;ref name=&quot;Lemann&quot; /&gt;  During the [[Reconstruction Era]] following the Civil War, Mississippi’s blacks and poor whites both benefited from the State's new constitution of 1886, which adopted universal suffrage; did away with property qualifications for suffrage or for office; provided for the state's first public school system; forbade race distinctions in the possession and inheritance of property; and prohibited limiting civil rights in travel.&lt;ref&gt;W.E.B. DuBois,''Black Reconstruction in America, 1860–1880''. New York: Harcourt Brace, 1935; reprint New York: The Free Press, 1998, p.437&lt;/ref&gt;  Those gains were short-lived, for by 1875 white Democrats had swept into office in Mississippi, bringing with them the [[Jim Crow laws]] of legal segregation.  This provides the historic background to an incident known as the &quot;Clarksdale Race Riot&quot;.  A former slave named Bill Peace, who had served in the Union Army and then returned to Clarksdale after the war, persuaded his former owner to allow him to form a security force to prevent theft from the plantation.  On October 9, 1875, whites in Clarksdale began hearing rumors that &quot;General Peace&quot; was preparing his troops to plunder and burn the town, and murder all the white people.  A white militia was formed, and Bill Peace’s &quot;revolt&quot; was soon put down.  Across Mississippi, white militias formed in response to similar shadowy incidents of armed black revolt.  Nicholas Lemann writes: &quot;Like the establishment of sharecropping, the restoration to power of the all-white Democratic Party in the South was a development of such magnitude to whites that it became encrusted in legend; many towns have their own mythic stories of the redemption of the white South.  In Clarksdale it is the story of the &quot;race riot&quot; of Oct. 9, 1875.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lemann&quot; /&gt;

===The Great Migration===

The movement of large numbers of people both to and from Clarksdale is prominent in the city's history.  Prior to 1920, Delta plantations were in constant need of laborers, and many black families moved to the area to work as sharecroppers.  After World War I, plantation owners even encouraged blacks to move from the other parts of Mississippi to the Delta region for work.  By this time, Clarksdale had also become home to a multi-cultural mixture of Lebanese, Italian, Chinese and Jewish immigrant merchants.  By 1920, the price of cotton had fallen, and many blacks living in the Delta began to leave. The [[Illinois Central Railroad]] operated a large depot in Clarksdale and provided a Chicago-bound route for those seeking greater economic opportunities in the north; it soon became the primary departure point for many.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lemann&quot; /&gt;

During the 1940s, three events occurred which increased the exodus of African-Americans from Clarksdale.  First, it became possible to commercially produce a cotton crop entirely by machine, which lessened the need for a large, low-paid workforce.  (Coincidentally, it was on 28 acres of the nearby Hopson Plantation where the [[International Harvester|International Harvester Company]] perfected the single-row mechanical cotton picking machine in 1946; soil was prepared, seeded, picked and bailed entirely by machines, while weeds were eradicated by flame.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dafvm.msstate.edu/landmarks/07/fall/4-6.pdf | format=[[PDF]] | title=Modern Cotton Production Has Deep Delta Roots| last=Ratliff| first=Bob | work=''Mississippi Landmarks'' magazine |publisher=Division of Agriculture, Forestry, and Veterinary Medicine at [[Mississippi State University]] | quote=Testing of the IH machines and machines produced by the Rust Cotton Picker Company in Memphis took place at the Delta Branch throughout the 1930s, and IH sent engineers and prototype pickers to the Hopson Plantation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Second, many African American GIs returned from World War II to find slim opportunities for employment in the Delta region.  Finally, there appeared an accelerated climate of racial hatred, as evidenced by the violence against such figures as [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]] representative [[Aaron Henry]].

[[Great Migration (African American)|&quot;The Great Migration&quot;]] north became the largest movement of Americans in U.S. history, and was recounted with Clarksdale triangulated with Chicago and Washington D.C. in Nicholas Lemann's award-winning book ''The Promised Land: The Great Black Migration and How it Changed America''.  [[History (TV channel)|The History Channel]] later produced a documentary based on the book, narrated by actor [[Morgan Freeman]], who is also a co-owner of Clarksdale’s Madidi restaurant and [[Ground Zero (blues club)|Ground Zero Blues Club]].

===Recent history===
Clarksdale was active in the civil rights movement, and on May 29, 1958, [[Martin Luther King, Jr.|Martin Luther King]] visited Clarksdale for the first major meeting of the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC). In 1960, Aaron Henry, a local pharmacist, was named state president of the NAACP, and went on to organize a two year-long boycott of Clarksdale businesses. In 1962, King again visited Clarksdale on the first stop on a region-wide tour, where he urged a crowd of 1000 to &quot;stand in, sit in, and walk by the thousands&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Clarksdale’s current mayor is [[Bill Luckett (businessman)|Bill Luckett]].

Clarksdale was thrust into national headlines in February 2013 after mayoral candidate [[Marco McMillian]] was found murdered near the town of [[Sherard, Mississippi|Sherard]], west of Clarksdale.  Because McMillian was openly gay, and due to the gruesome level of violence inflicted, there has been speculation about whether his murder was a hate crime.

==Music history==
[[File:ClarksdaleMS Crossroads.jpg|thumb|The crossroads where legend has it blues guitarist Robert Johnson sold his soul to the devil.]]
Clarksdale has been historically significant in the history of the [[blues]]. The [[Mississippi Blues Trail]], now being implemented, is dedicating markers for historic sites such as Clarksdale's [[Riverside Hotel (Clarksdale)|Riverside Hotel]], where [[Bessie Smith]] died following an auto accident on [[U.S. Route 61|Highway 61]]. The [[Riverside Hotel (Clarksdale)|Riverside Hotel]] is just one of many historical blues sites in Clarksdale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roadfan.com/clark2.html
|title=Clarkesdale Blues|publisher=roadfan.com|accessdate=2007-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Early supporters of the effort to preserve Clarksdale's musical legacy included the award-winning photographer and journalist Panny Mayfield, [[Living Blues]] magazine founder [[Jim O'Neal]], and attorney Walter Thompson, father of sports journalist [[Wright Thompson]]. In 1995, [[Mt. Zion Memorial Fund]] founder Skip Henderson, a vintage guitar dealer from [[New Brunswick, New Jersey]] and friend of Delta Blues Museum founder Sid Graves, purchased the [[Illinois Central Railroad]] passenger depot to save it from planned demolition. With the help of local businessman Jon Levingston, as well as the Delta Council, Henderson received a $1.279 million grant from the federal government to restore the passenger depot. These redevelopment funds were then transferred on the advice of Clarksdale's City attorney, Hunter Twiford, to Coahoma County, in order to establish a tourism locale termed &quot;Blues Alley&quot;, after a phrase coined by then Mayor, Henry Espy. The popularity of the [[Delta Blues Museum]] and the growth of the Sunflower River Blues Festival and Juke Joint Festivals has provided an economic boost to the city.

In late 1979 Carnegie Public Library Director Sid Graves began a nascent display series which later became the nucleus of the [[Delta Blues Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/23/arts/muddy-waters-s-imprint-on-mississippi.html |title=Muddy Waters's Imprint on Mississippi |author=Robbert Palmer |date=23 April 1988 |accessdate=4 October 2009 |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graves single-handedly nurtured the beginnings of the museum in the face of an indifferent community and an often recalcitrant Library Board, at times resorting to storing displays in the trunk of his car when denied space in the library. When the fledgling museum was accidentally discovered by [[Billy Gibbons]] of the rock band [[ZZ Top]] through contact with Howard Stovall Jr., the [[Delta Blues Museum]] became the subject of national attention as a pet project of the band, and the Museum began to enjoy national recognition.

In 1995 the museum, at that time Clarksdale's only attraction, grew to include a large section of the newly renovated library building, but remained under the tight control of the Carnegie Library Board, who subsequently fired Sid Graves, at the time seriously ill. Graves died in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, in January 2005. In an interim move from the renovated Library building, the Museum spent most of 1996 in a converted retail storefront on Delta Avenue under the direction of a politically connected former Wisconsin native, the late Ron Gorsegner. In 1997-1998 Coahoma County would finally provide funds to form a separate Museum Board of Directors composed mainly of socially prominent, local white blues fans, and to renovate the adjoining [[Illinois Central Railroad]] freight depot, providing a permanent home for the Delta Blues Museum.

===Mississippi Blues Trail marker===
Clarksdale has received a historic marker as a site on the [[Mississippi Blues Trail]] by the Mississippi Blues Commission in recognition of its importance in the development of the [[blues]] in Mississippi. The marker is on Stovall Road at the alleged cabin site of famed bluesman McKinley Morganfield a/k/a [[Muddy Waters]] a fact that has never been conclusively verified. Morganfield supposedly lived there from 1915 until 1943 while he worked on the large Stovall cotton Plantation before moving to [[Chicago]] after mistreatment at the hands of a Stovall overseer as documented by author [[Peter Guralnick]] in his book &quot;Feel Like Going Home: Portraits in Blues, Country, and Rock 'n' Roll&quot;.
A second Mississippi Blues Trail historic marker is placed at the [[Riverside Hotel (Clarksdale)|Riverside Hotel]] that provided lodging for blues entertainers passing through the delta.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Oxford''' is a city in, and the [[county seat]] of, [[Lafayette County, Mississippi|Lafayette County]], [[Mississippi]], [[United States]]. Founded in 1837, it was named after the British university city of [[Oxford]] in hopes of having the state university located there, which it did successfully attract. 

As of the 2010 US Census, the population is 18,916. Oxford is the home of the [[University of Mississippi]], founded in 1848, also commonly known as &quot;Ole Miss.&quot;

Oxford has been named by ''[[USA Today]]'' as one of the top six college towns in the nation. It is included in ''The Best 100 Small Towns in America''. Lafayette County consistently leads the state rankings in the lowest unemployment rate per quarter.  Oxford City Schools are ranked as &quot;Star&quot; schools, the highest ranking available, and Lafayette County school systems are consistently ranked as &quot;5-star&quot; systems.

==History==

Oxford and Lafayette County were formed from lands ceded by the Chickasaw in the treaty of Pontotoc Creek in 1832.  The county was organized in 1836, and in 1837 three pioneers—John Martin, John Chisom, and John Craig—purchased land from Hoka, a female Chickasaw landowner, as a site for the town.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Lamar Mayfield. ''Oxford and Ole Miss''. Arcadia Publishing, 2009, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; They named it Oxford, intending to promote it as a center of learning in the Old Southwest.  In 1841, the Mississippi legislature selected Oxford as the site of the state university, which opened in 1848.

During the [[American Civil War]], Oxford suffered invasion by federal troops under Generals [[Ulysses S. Grant]] and [[William T. Sherman]] in 1862; in 1864 Major General [[Andrew Jackson Smith]] burned the buildings in the town square, including the county courthouse.  In the postwar [[Reconstruction Era]], the town recovered slowly, aided by federal judge [[Robert Andrews Hill]], who secured funds to build a new courthouse in 1872. During this period many African American [[freedman|freedmen]] moved from farms into town and established a neighborhood known as &quot;Freedmen Town&quot;, where they built houses, businesses, churches and schools, and exercised all the rights of citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historymarkersofms.com/Lafayette/Freedmen_Town.JPG Freedmen Town, Lafayette County, History Markers of Mississippi], accessed 30 May 2008,&lt;/ref&gt;  Even after Mississippi [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchised]] most African Americans in the [[Mississippi Constitution|Constitution of 1890]], they continued to build their lives in the face of discrimination.

During the [[Civil Rights Movement]], Oxford gained national attention in 1962 as state officials attempted to prevent [[James Meredith]], an African American, from enrolling at the [[University of Mississippi]] after being admitted by a federal court. After President John F. Kennedy, following negotiations with Governor [[Ross Barnett]], ordered United States Marshals to protect him, Meredith traveled to Oxford under armed guard to register in late September 1962, and riots broke out in protest of his admittance. Thousands of armed &quot;volunteers&quot; flowed into the Oxford area to prevent Meredith's admittance. During a night of riots by segregationists, cars were burned, federal marshals were pelted with rocks, bricks, small arms fire and university property was damaged; two men were killed by gunshot wounds. The riot spread into adjacent areas of the city of Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;Doyle, William. ''An American Insurrection: James Meredith and the Battle of Oxford, Mississippi, 1962.'' New York: Anchor Books, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  Order was restored to the campus with the early morning arrival of nationalized Mississippi National Guard and regular U.S. Army units, who camped in the City.&lt;ref&gt;Eagles. Charles W. &quot;'The Fight for Men's Minds': The
Aftermath of the Ole Miss Riot of 1962&quot; http://mdah.state.ms.us/pubs/riot.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

More than 3000 journalists came to Oxford on September 26, 2008 to cover the [[United States presidential election debates, 2008|first presidential debate of 2008]], which was held at the [[University of Mississippi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://debate.olemiss.edu/ 2008 Presidential Debate | The University of Mississippi - Official Home Page]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==

Oxford is located at {{Coord|34|21|35|N|89|31|34|W|type:city}} (34.359837, -89.526242).{{GR|1}}

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|10.0|sqmi|km2}}, of which, {{convert|10.0|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and 0.10% is water.

The land is hilly in places but is generally level. To the west is the [[Mississippi Delta]].
It is within one hundred miles of [[Memphis, Tennessee]].

Oxford is located at the confluence of highways from eight directions: Mississippi highway 6 (now co-signed with [[U.S. Route 278|US-278]]) runs west to [[Batesville, Mississippi|Batesville]] and east to [[Pontotoc, Mississippi|Pontotoc]]; highway 7 runs north to [[Holly Springs, Mississippi|Holly Springs]] and south to [[Water Valley, Mississippi|Water Valley]].  Highway 30 goes northeast to [[New Albany, Mississippi|New Albany]]; highway 334 (&quot;Old Highway 6&quot;) southeast to [[Toccopola, Mississippi|Toccopola]]; Taylor Road southwest to [[Taylor, Mississippi|Taylor]], and highway 314 (&quot;Old Sardis Road&quot;) northwest, formerly to [[Sardis, Mississippi|Sardis]] but now to the Clear Creek Recreation Area on [[Sardis Lake (Mississippi)|Sardis Lake]].

The streets in the downtown area follow a grid pattern with two [[street name|naming conventions]].  Many of the north-south streets are numbered from west to east, beginning at the old railroad depot, with numbers from four to nineteen.  The place of &quot;Twelfth Street,&quot; however, is taken by North and South Lamar Boulevard (formerly North and South Streets).  The east-west avenues are named for the U.S. presidents in chronological order from north to south, from [[George Washington|Washington]] to [[Grover Cleveland|Cleveland]]; here again, there are gaps: John Quincy Adams would be indistinguishable from John Adams; &quot;Polk Avenue&quot; is replaced by University Avenue, and &quot;Arthur Avenue&quot; is lacking.

==Demographics==

As of the [[census]]{{GR|2}} of 2010, there were 18,916 people, with 8,648 households residing in the city. The racial makeup of the city was 72.3% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 21.8% [[African American (U.S. Census)|African American]], 0.3% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 3.3% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], 0.1% [[Pacific Islander (U.S. Census)|Pacific Islander]], and 1.1% from two or more races. [[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]] of any race were 2.5% of the population. The average household size was 2.09.

The median income for a household in the city was $38,872, and the average household income was $64,643. The [[per capita income]] for the city was $29,195.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clrsearch.com/Oxford_Demographics/MS/Household-Income Oxford, MS Household Income Statistics]. CLRSearch. Retrieved on 2013-08-17.&lt;/ref&gt; About 12% of families and 32.3% of the population were below the [[poverty line]].

==Education==
The City of Oxford is served by the [[Oxford School District]] and by two private schools, Oxford University School and Regents School. Regents is located just outside the city limits in the College Hill community.  Oxford is the home of the main campus of the [[University of Mississippi]], known as &quot;Ole Miss&quot;, and of the Lafayette-Yalobusha Center of [[Northwest Mississippi Community College]].

== Health care ==
The [http://www.baptistonline.org/facilities/oxford/ Baptist Memorial Hospital - North Mississippi], located in Oxford provides comprehensive health care services for Oxford and the surrounding area, supported by a growing number of physicians, clinics and support facilities.  The North Mississippi Regional Center, a state-licensed Intermediate Care Facility for the Mentally Retarded, is located in Oxford.

Oxford is home to the National Center for Natural Products Research at the University of Mississippi's School of Pharmacy. The Center is the only facility in the United States that is federally licensed to cultivate [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] for scientific research, and for distribution to patients who are allowed marijuana for medical purposes.

==Transportation==
The City of Oxford operates public transportation under the name Oxford-University Transit (OUT), with bus routes throughout the city and University of Mississippi campus.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxfordms.net/visitors/transit/bus-routes-a-schedules.html&lt;/ref&gt; Ole Miss students and faculty ride free upon showing University identification.

[[University-Oxford Airport]] serves the Lafayette-Oxford-University area. While no airline service is available, the airport can become quite busy during sporting events at the [[University of Mississippi]].

[[Mississippi Central Railroad (present)|Mississippi Central Railroad]] provides freight rail service to the Lafayette County Industrial Park in Oxford.

[[Image:TheFaulknerPortable.jpg|250px|right|thumb|William Faulkner's [[Underwood Typewriter Company|Underwood]] Universal Portable typewriter in his office at [[Rowan Oak]] (see below), which is now maintained by the [[University of Mississippi]] in Oxford as a museum.]]
* [[William Faulkner]] adopted Oxford as his hometown after growing up there when his family moved  to Oxford from nearby [[New Albany, MS|New Albany]] when he was three.  Oxford is the model for the city &quot;Jefferson&quot; in his fiction, and [[Lafayette County, Mississippi]], was the model for his fictional [[Yoknapatawpha County]]. His former home, [[Rowan Oak]], now owned by the University of Mississippi and recently remodeled, is a favorite tourist attraction in Oxford. Several members of Faulkner's family still live in the Oxford and Lafayette County area.
* [[John Grisham]] also has a home in Oxford. He received a [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] from the [[University of Mississippi School of Law]] in 1981 and practiced law in the Mississippi suburbs of [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]]  for ten years before retiring to write full-time. He and his family relocated to Oxford in the early 1990s. Mr. Grisham still maintains a home in Oxford but his primary residence is now in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]].
* Curtis Wilkie, Jane Ann Mullen, [[Ace Atkins]], Tom Franklin, [[Beth Ann Fennelly]], [[Ann Fisher-Wirth]], Neil White, Wright Thompson, and [[Jesmyn Ward]] are among the many writers who live in Oxford. Deceased authors [[Stark Young]], [[Larry Brown (author)|Larry Brown]], [[Willie Morris]], and [[Barry Hannah]] also called Oxford home.  [[Howard Bahr]] and [[Richard Ford]] also lived in Oxford for an extended period.
* Oxford has been called the art center of the South. Famous artists include [[photorealism|photorealist]] painter [[Glennray Tutor]]; figurative painter [[Jere Allen]];  expressionist painter Paula Temple; portraitist Jason Bouldin, sculptor William Beckwith; sculptor Rod Moorhead; and primitive artist Theora Hamblett (1895–1977). New Orleans artist [[John McCrady]] (1911–1968) studied art at Ole Miss.
* [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] [[Jacob Thompson]] (1810–1885) owned a manor called &quot;Home Place&quot; in Oxford that was burned down in 1864 during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] by [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] troops. A historical marker stands on the spot where it once stood.
* [[Lucius Quintus Cincinnatus Lamar II|L.Q.C. Lamar]] (1825–1893), U.S. senator and supreme court justice, resided in Oxford, where he served as professor of mathematics at the [[University of Mississippi]], farmed, and practiced law.  He was the son-in-law of university chancellor [[Augustus Baldwin Longstreet]].  Lamar's home in Oxford has recently been restored (2008) as a museum.
*[[New York Giants]] quarterback [[Eli Manning]] lives in Oxford during the offseason. His father, former [[Ole Miss]] and [[New Orleans Saints]] quarterback [[Archie Manning]], owns a condominium in Oxford.
&lt;!-- NOTE: THIS IS NOT INTENDED TO BE A COMPLETE LIST! It needs to stay reasonably short. INSTEAD, ADD NEW ENTRIES TO [[List of people from Mississippi]]. --&gt;

==Attractions==
[[Image:RowanOak.jpg|thumb|250px|Rowan Oak]]
* The courthouse square, called &quot;The Square&quot;, is the geographic and cultural center of the city. In addition to the historic Lafayette County Courthouse, the Square is known for an abundance of locally owned restaurants, specialty boutiques, and professional offices, along with Oxford City Hall.
* The J. E. Neilson Co., located on the southeast corner of the square is the South's oldest documented store. Founded as a trading post in 1839, Neilson's continues to anchor the Oxford square. When the [[Great Depression]] hit Oxford and most of the banks in town closed, Neilson's acted as a surrogate bank, cashing paychecks for university employees and others.
* [[Square Books]], a local bookstore founded in 1979, is consistently ranked among the best [[independent bookstore]]s in the country. A sister store, Off Square Books, which is several doors down the street to the east, deals in used and remainder books and is the venue for a radio show called Thacker Mountain Radio, with host Jim Dees, that is broadcast state-wide on Mississippi Public Broadcasting. The show often draws comparisons to [[Garrison Keillor]]'s ''[[A Prairie Home Companion]]'' for its mix of author readings and musical guests. A third store, Square Books Jr., deals exclusively in children's books and educational toys.
* The Lyric, just off the courthouse square, is Oxford's largest music venue, with a capacity near 1200. Originally built in the late 1800s, the structure became a livery stable owned by William Faulkner’s family in the early part of the 20th century.  During the 1920s it became Oxford's first motion picture theater, the Lyric. In 1949, Faulkner walked from [[Rowan Oak|his home]] in Oxford to his childhood stable for the world premiere of MGM’s ''Intruder in the Dust'', adapted from one of his novels. Abandoned for many years, the building housed office space and a health center from the early 1980s. After extensive restoration, the Lyric reopened on 3 July 2008 as a live music venue. It also is used occasionally for film and live drama.

== Cultural ==
* Oxford has had a thriving and diverse music scene for many years, often drawing comparisons to other [[Southern United States|Southern]] college towns with active musical life, such as [[Charlottesville, Virginia]]; [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina]]; [[Gainesville, Florida]]; [[Austin, Texas]]; or [[Athens, Georgia]]. Oxford's relatively close proximity to large music cities such as [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]], and [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], make it a regular stop for most of the current musicians and bands who tour on a regular basis. Musicians past and present living in Oxford include [[Beanland (band)|Beanland]], [[The Cooters (band)|The Cooters]], [[Bass Drum of Death]], [[Kudzu Kings]], [[Blue Mountain (band)|Blue Mountain]], [[George McConnell]], [[Caroline Herring]] and blues harp player [[Adam Gussow]].
* Oxford is also the home of the renegade [[blues]] label [[Fat Possum Records]], who released records by blues legends [[R. L. Burnside]] and [[Junior Kimbrough]], as well as [[The Black Keys]].  [[Johnny Marr]], former [[guitarist]] for [[The Smiths]] and current member of [[Modest Mouse]] bought a home in Oxford but no longer lives in it.  Former [[Derek and the Dominos]] member [[Bobby Whitlock]] lived in Oxford where he had a ranch and his own studio.
* Musicians [[Modest Mouse]], [[Gavin Degraw]], [[Elvis Costello]], [[The Hives]], and [[Counting Crows]] have recorded albums at [[Sweet Tea Recording Studio]] in Oxford. Dennis Herring, the owner of Sweet Tea, has received Grammy awards for his work with artists such as [[Jars of Clay]] and blues great [[Buddy Guy]].
* [[Bob Dylan]] wrote a song called &quot;[[Oxford Town]]&quot;, which was included on his album [[The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan]]. The song was about the violent events surrounding the admission of [[James Meredith]] into the [[University of Mississippi]] in 1962. Dylan played a memorable concert at the Tad Smith Coliseum on the Ole Miss campus in November 1990, which opened with a performance of the song ''Oxford Town''.
* Oxford has been the setting for numerous movies, including ''Intruder in the Dust'' (1949, based on the [[Intruder in the Dust|Faulkner novel]]), [[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]] (1960), ''Barn Burning'' (1980, based on the [[Barn Burning|Faulkner short story]]), ''Rush'' (1981 documentary), ''[[Heart of Dixie]]'' (1989), ''[[The Gun in Betty Lou's Handbag]]'' (1992), ''Sorry, We're Open'' (2008 documentary), ''The Night of the Loup Garou'' (2009), ''Where I Begin'' (2010), and parts of ''[[The People vs. Larry Flynt]]'' (1997).

'''Biloxi''' ({{IPAc-en|b|ə|ˈ|l|ʌ|k|s|i}}; {{respell|bə|LUK|see}}), officially the '''City of Biloxi''', is a city in [[Harrison County, Mississippi]]. The [[2010 United States Census]] recorded the population as 44,054. Along with the adjoining city of [[Gulfport, Mississippi|Gulfport]], Biloxi is a county seat of Harrison County.

The city is part of the [[Gulfport-Biloxi metropolitan area]] and the [[Gulfport-Biloxi-Pascagoula, Mississippi Combined Statistical Area]]. Pre-[[Hurricane Katrina|Katrina]], Biloxi was the third largest city in Mississippi behind [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]] and [[Gulfport, Mississippi|Gulfport]]; but with its population losses following that storm, it was passed by [[Hattiesburg, Mississippi|Hattiesburg]].  Also, in the 2010 census, [[Southaven, Mississippi|Southaven]] is shown as the fourth largest city, so Biloxi is now ranked fifth in the state.

The beachfront of Biloxi lies directly on the [[Mississippi Sound]], with [[barrier island]]s scattered off the coast and into the [[Gulf of Mexico]].

[[Keesler Air Force Base]] lies within the city and is home to the [[81st Training Wing]] and the [[403d Wing]] of the [[United States|U.S. Air Force]] Reserve.

==History==

===Colonial era===
The first permanent settlement in [[Louisiana (New France)|French Louisiana]] was founded at [[Fort Maurepas]], now in [[Ocean Springs, Mississippi]] and referred to as Old Biloxi, in 1699 under the direction of [[Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville]], with Louisiana separated from [[Spanish Florida]] at the [[Perdido River]] near [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]] (founded 1559 and again in 1698).

The name of Biloxi in French was ''&quot;Bilocci&quot;'' (with ''&quot;fort Maurepas&quot;''),&lt;ref name=enquete/&gt; and the name was sometimes translated into English as &quot;Fort Bilocci&quot; on maps updated circa year 1710/1725.&lt;ref name=&quot;rmaps1&quot;&gt;

In 1720, the administrative capital of [[Louisiana (New France)|French Louisiana]] was moved to Biloxi (or Bilocci) from [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]] (or ''Mobille''). French Louisiana (part of New France) was known in French as ''La Louisiane'' in colonial times, but in modern times is called ''&quot;La Louisiane française&quot;'' to distinguish from the modern state of [[Louisiana]] (also ''&quot;Louisiane&quot;'' in French).&lt;ref name=&quot;enquete&quot;&gt;&quot;La Louisiane française&quot; (in French), by Virginie Tanlay, from book ''Histoire de la Louisiane'', [http://flfa.free.fr/enquete7.htm flfa-enquete7]: states that [[Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville|Iberville]] chose &quot;le site de Bilocci&quot; (or Biloxi)
&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to fears of tides and hurricanes in the 18th century, the capital of French Louisiana was later moved by colonial governor [[Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville|Bienville]], in 1723, from Biloxi to a new inland harbor town named ''La Nouvelle-Orléans'' ([[New Orleans]]), built for the purpose in 1718–1720.

In 1763, following Great Britain's victory in the [[Seven Years War]], [[France]] had to cede French Louisiana east of the [[Mississippi River]], except for New Orleans, to [[Great Britain]], as part of the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]]. At that same time, Louisiana west of the Mississippi, including New Orleans, was ceded to [[Spain]] as part of the [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1762)|Treaty of Fontainebleau]].

===Subsequent history===
[[File:Howard Street Biloxi Mississippi 1906.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Looking West down Howard Avenue at Lameuse Street in Biloxi in 1906]]
British rule persisted from 1763 to 1779, and then Spanish rule from 1779 to 1798. Despite this, the character of Biloxi remained mostly French.&lt;ref name=&quot;hco&quot;&gt;&quot;Biloxi: A Historic &amp; Cultural Overview&quot;. City of Biloxi historical pamphlet, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1811, Biloxi came under United States of America control as part of the [[Mississippi Territory]]. Mississippi, and Biloxi with it, were then admitted to the union in 1817.

Now that ownership was settled, Biloxi began to grow. It became a summer resort, with the advantages of close proximity to New Orleans and ease of access via water. Summer homes were built by well-to-do farmers and commercial figures. Hotels and rental cottages came into existence to serve those who could not afford their own homes.&lt;ref name=&quot;hco&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Biloxi Lighthouse 2010.jpg|right|250px|thumb|[[Biloxi Lighthouse]], built in 1848 and reputed to be one of the most photographed objects in the American South.&lt;ref name=&quot;blh&quot;/&gt;]]
One of Biloxi's most known features has been the [[Biloxi Lighthouse]], which was built in [[Baltimore]] and then shipped south and completed in May 1848.&lt;ref name=&quot;blh&quot;&gt;&quot;Biloxi Lighthouse&quot;. City of Biloxi historical datasheet, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; (It and another are the only surviving lighthouses of twelve that once dotted the [[Mississippi Gulf Coast]].&lt;ref name=&quot;blh&quot;/&gt;)

In the early stages of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], [[Ship Island (Mississippi)|Ship Island]] was captured by [[Union Army|Union forces]], which led to the effective Union capture of Biloxi as well. No major battles were fought in the area, and Biloxi did not suffer direct damage from the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;hco&quot;/&gt; Some local Union sentiment could be discerned following the war's conclusion.&lt;ref name=&quot;blh&quot;/&gt;

In the postbellum period, Biloxi again emerged as a vacation spot. Its popularity as a destination increased with railroad access. In 1881, the first [[cannery]] was built in the town, leading to others soon joining the location. Biloxi grew again, and as different [[ethnic group]]s came to work in the seafood factories, Biloxi gained a more heterogeneous population.&lt;ref name=&quot;hco&quot;/&gt;

During [[World War II]], the [[United States Army Air Forces]] built Keesler Field, now [[Keesler Air Force Base]], which became a major [[basic training]] site and site for aircraft maintenance. The Biloxi economy boomed as a result,&lt;ref name=&quot;isjl&quot;&gt;[http://www.isjl.org/history/archive/ms/biloxi.htm &quot;Biloxi/Gulfport, Mississippi&quot;], [[Institute of Southern Jewish Life]]&lt;/ref&gt; again bringing more diverse groups to the area. By 1958, the first [[Synagogue|Jewish synagogue]] had been built in the town.&lt;ref name=&quot;isjl&quot;/&gt;

Biloxi's [[casino]] history dates back to a period in the 1940s, when open, if technically illegal, gambling took place in a casino within the [[Broadwater Beach Resort]].&lt;ref name=&quot;sh-landmark&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.hotel-online.com/News/PR2005_3rd/Aug05_Broadwater.html | title=The Landmark Broadwater Hotel, Once Biloxi's Premier Resort, Shutting Down | author=Wilemon, Tom | publisher=[[The Sun Herald]] | date=2005-06-30 | accessdate=2008-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Open gambling ended during the 1950s.&lt;ref name=&quot;sh-before&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.sunherald.com/images/beforeafter/broadwater.html | title=Before-After: Broadwater | author=Bergeron, Kat | publisher=[[The Sun Herald]] | accessdate=2008-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mississippi Gulf Coast]] became known as the &quot;Poor Man's Riviera&quot;, and was frequented by [[Southern United States|Southern]] families interested in fishing expeditions during the summer.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-1963&quot;/&gt; Commercially, Biloxi was dominated by shrimp boats and oyster luggers.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-1963&quot;/&gt;

In the early 1960s, the Gulf Coast again emerged as a prime alternative to [[Florida]] as a southern vacation destination among [[Northern United States|Northerners]], with Biloxi a center of the focus.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-1963&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=FA0C16FC3E5B1A7B93C7A81789D95F478685F9 | title=Mississippi Gulf Coast Woos Vacationists | author=Janson, Donald | publisher=The New York Times | date=1963-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biloxi hotels upgraded their amenities and hired chefs from France and Switzerland in an effort to provide some of the best seafood cuisine in the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-1963&quot;/&gt; [[Edgewater Mall]] was built in 1963.

With the introduction of legal gambling in Mississippi in the 1990s, Biloxi was again transformed.&lt;ref name=&quot;isjl&quot;/&gt; It became an important center for casinos, and the hotels and complexes brought millions of dollars in tourism revenue to the city. The more famous casino complexes were the [[Beau Rivage (Mississippi)|Beau Rivage]] casino resort, the [[Hard Rock Hotel and Casino (Biloxi)]], [[Casino Magic Biloxi Casino &amp; Hotel|Casino Magic]], [[Grand Casino Biloxi|Grand Casino]], [[Isle of Capri Casinos|Isle of Capri Casino Resort Biloxi]], [[Penn National Gaming|Boomtown Casino]], [[President Casino Broadwater Resort]], and [[IP Hotel and Casino|Imperial Palace]]. Like [[Tunica County, Mississippi|Tunica County]] in the northern part of the state, Biloxi and the surrounding Gulf Coast region was considered a leading gambling center in the [[Southern United States]].

To celebrate the area's Tricentennial in 1998/99, the city's tourism promotion agency invited the nationally syndicated Travel World Radio Show to broadcast live from Biloxi, with co-host Willem Bagchus in attendance.

By the early 21st century, Biloxi's economy rested on the three prongs of seafood, tourism and gaming.&lt;ref name=&quot;hco&quot;/&gt;

===Hurricanes===
Scores of hurricanes have hit the Mississippi Gulf Coast, but the most destructive, as measured by storm surge levels in the [[Biloxi Light]]house, occurred in 1855, 1906, 1909, 1947, 1969 ([[Hurricane Camille]]), and 2005 ([[Hurricane Katrina]])&lt;ref&gt;Debbie Stringer. 2010.

On August 29, 2005, [[Hurricane Katrina]] hit the [[Mississippi Gulf Coast]] with high winds, heavy rains and a {{convert|27|ft|m|sing=on}} storm surge, causing massive damage to the area.
Katrina came ashore during the high tide of 6:56AM, +2.3&amp;nbsp;feet more.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;2005 NOAA Tide Predictions: Biloxi (Cadet Point), Biloxi Bay&quot; (2005), tide on 29-Aug-2005, ''NOAA'', web: [http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/get_predictions.shtml?year=2005&amp;stn=0551+South+Pass&amp;secstn=Biloxi+(Cadet+Point),+Biloxi+Bay&amp;thh=%2b2&amp;thm=4&amp;tlh=%2b1&amp;tlm=30&amp;hh=*1.38&amp;hl=*1.38 NOAA-tide-tables].&lt;/ref&gt;
Commenting on the&amp;nbsp;power of the storm and the damage, Mayor [[A.J. Holloway]] said, &quot;This is our [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake|tsunami]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sunherald.com/mld/sunherald/news/special_packages/hurricane_katrina/12514756.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Mississippi Governor [[Haley Barbour]] was quoted as saying the destruction of the Mississippi coastline by [[Hurricane Katrina]] looked like an American [[Hiroshima]].

On the morning of August 31, 2005, in an interview on [[MSNBC]], Governor Barbour stated that 90% of the buildings along the coast in Biloxi and neighboring [[Gulfport, Mississippi|Gulfport]] had been destroyed by the hurricane. Several of the &quot;floating&quot; casinos were torn off their supports and thrown inland, contributing to the damage.

Many churches were destroyed or severely damaged, including St. Michael's Catholic Church (see photo at right), which was gutted by the storm surge, breaking the entry doors and stained-glass windows along the first floor; however, the interior was later removed, and the structure was still solid enough to allow repairing the church.

Hurricane Katrina damaged over 40 Mississippi libraries, flooding several feet in the Biloxi Public Library and breaking windows, beyond repair, requiring a total rebuild.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Hurricane Katrina Related Damages to Public Libraries in Mississippi&quot; (September 2005), Mississippi Library Commission, web:[http://www.ala.org/ala/cro/katrina/MSPL_Katrina_Damage.pdf ALA-Katrina].&lt;/ref&gt;

Hurricane-force winds persisted for 17 hours and tore the branches off many coastal oak trees, but the tree trunks survived the {{convert|30|ft|m|sing=on}} flood and many have since regrown smaller branches. Some reconstructed homes still have the [[Antebellum architecture|antebellum]] appearance, and miles inland, with less flooding, shopping centers have re-opened.

Harrison County [[Coroner]] Gary T. Hargrove told the mayor and City Council that Hurricane Katrina had claimed 53 victims in Biloxi, as of January 30, 2006. Of the 53 confirmed fatalities in Biloxi, a figure that includes one unidentified male, Hargrove said the average age was 58, with the youngest being 22 and the oldest 90; 14 were female and 39 were male.

Biloxi is also the site of a well-known memorial to the Katrina victims, built by the crew and volunteers of ''[[Extreme Makeover: Home Edition]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gulf-coast.com/Attractions/KatrinaMemorialBiloxi.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Many casinos were damaged or destroyed by Hurricane Katrina. Of the casinos that were located in Biloxi, eight have reopened since Katrina. They are: the Grand Biloxi Casino Hotel Spa (formerly known as Grand Casino Biloxi), the Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino, the Isle of Capri Casino and Resort, the Palace Casino Resort, the IP Casino Resort Spa (formerly known as Imperial Palace), Treasure Bay Casino, Boomtown Casino, and the Beau Rivage, which reopened on the first anniversary of Hurricane Katrina.&lt;ref name=BixCasinos&gt;&quot;Tentative re-opening plans for Biloxi casino resorts&quot; (2006), City of Biloxi, www.Biloxi.ms.us, webpage:[http://www.biloxi.ms.us/Casinos/ Biloxi-Casinos].&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiple plans have been laid out to rebuild the waterfront areas of Biloxi, and the federal government has recently announced that it is considering giving up to 17,000 Mississippi coast homeowners the option to sell their properties so that a vast hurricane-protection zone can be implemented.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5ib5MyH-XXFnw4D_gLfXvd4hmx4SQD8S64ME80 Gov't May Buy Thousands of Miss.

==History==
{{expand section|date=February 2012}}
[[File:Drew, Mississippi 1.jpg|left|thumb|Drew, Mississippi]]
Todd J. Moye, author of ''Let the People Decide: Black Freedom and White Resistance Movements in Sunflower County, Mississippi, 1945-1986'', said that the white residents of Drew &quot;traditionally been regarded as the most recalcitrant in the count on racial matters.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Moye28&quot;&gt;Moye, p. [http://books.google.com/books?id=KZ4IoG1nQuUC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;lpg=PA28&amp;dq=Parchman+%22middle+of+nowhere%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8iErWRgWxk&amp;sig=w7ZwTFf-eOlI4OxQU1Kp-1DVQsw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=p4pJT8fNHsjItgfLp5juAg&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=Parchman%20%22middle%20of%20nowhere%22&amp;f=false 28].&lt;/ref&gt; Moye explained that Whites in Drew were &quot;considered the most recalcitrant of [[Sunflower County]], and perhaps the state.&quot;&lt;ref name=Moye128&gt;Moye, p. [http://books.google.com/books?id=KZ4IoG1nQuUC&amp;pg=PA128&amp;dq=%22The+Ruleville+Freedom+School+was%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FDlRUcGuA47e8wSg-4CAAw&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20Ruleville%20Freedom%20School%20was%22&amp;f=false 128].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s a man named [[Joe Pullen]] was lynched near Drew after killing 13 members of his lynch mob and injuring 26 of them.&lt;ref name=Moye128/&gt;

Since Drew is in close proximity to the [[Mississippi State Penitentiary]] (also known as Parchman) Moye said that historically Drew was &quot;a dangerous place to be black.&quot;&lt;ref name=Moye128/&gt; In the 1930s and 1940s many police officers shot blacks, saying that they appeared like escaped prisoners from Parchman.&lt;ref name=Moye128/&gt;

During the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–1968)|20th Century African-American Civil Rights Movement]], when attempts were made to move [[Fannie Lou Hamer]]'s movement for poor people in [[Ruleville, Mississippi|Ruleville]] to Drew, the organizers, according to Moye, &quot;faced stiff resistance.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Moye28&quot;/&gt; [[Mae Bertha Carter]], a major figure in the area civil rights movement, originated from Drew.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moye28&quot;/&gt;

'''Gulfport''' is the second largest city in [[Mississippi]] after the state capital [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]]. It is the larger of the two principal cities of the [[Gulfport-Biloxi, Mississippi Metropolitan Statistical Area]],&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulfport-Biloxi-Pascagoula,_Mississippi_Combined_Statistical_Area&lt;/ref&gt; which is included in the [[Gulfport-Biloxi-Pascagoula, Mississippi Combined Statistical Area]]. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the city of Gulfport had a total population of 69,220. Gulfport is co-[[county seat]] with [[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]] of [[Harrison County, Mississippi]]. Gulfport is also home to the [[United States Navy|US Navy]] Atlantic Fleet [[Seabees]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seabee.navy.mil/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Gulfport was incorporated on July 28, 1898. Gulfport was founded by two men: [[William H. Hardy]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lib.usm.edu/legacy/archives/m380.htm&lt;/ref&gt; who was president of the [[Gulf and Ship Island Railroad]] (G&amp;SIRR) that connected inland lumber mills to the coast, and [[Joseph T. Jones]] who later took over the G&amp;SIRR, dredged the harbor in Gulfport, and opened the shipping channel to the sea. In 1902, the harbor was completed and the Port of Gulfport became a working seaport that now accounts for millions of dollars in annual sales and tax revenue for the state of Mississippi.

[[File:Steamer loading resin, Gulfport, MS 1906 cph.3b18580.jpg|thumb|Steamer loading [[resin]] in Gulfport, 1906]]
From its beginnings as a lumber port, Gulfport evolved into a diversified city. With about 6.7 miles (10.7 kilometers) of white sand beaches along the [[Gulf of Mexico]], Gulfport has become a tourism destination, due in large part to Mississippi's Coast Casinos. Gulfport has served as host to popular cultural events such as the &quot;World's Largest Fishing Rodeo,&quot; &quot;Cruisin' the Coast&quot; (a week of classic cars), and &quot;Smokin' the Sound&quot; (speedboat races). Gulfport is a thriving residential community with a strong mercantile center.  There are historic neighborhoods and home sites, as well as diverse shopping opportunities and several motels scattered throughout to accommodate golfing, gambling, and water-sport tourism.

In 1910, the U.S. Post Office and Customhouse was built. The Gulfport Post office was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;http://nrhp.focus.nps.gov/natreg/docs/All_Data.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1916, Mayor [[George M. Foote]] announced that the [[Andrew Carnegie]] Corporation was going to place a [[Carnegie Library]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.harrison.lib.ms.us/history/history_outline.htm#1890&lt;/ref&gt; in Gulfport.

On August 17, 1969 Gulfport and the Mississippi Gulf Coast was hit by Hurricane Camille. By central pressure, Camille was the second strongest U.S. land falling hurricane in recorded history.  The area of total destruction in Harrison County, Mississippi was 68 square miles (180 km2).[11] The total estimated cost of damage was $1.42 billion (1969 USD, $9 billion 2012 USD).[12] This made Camille the second-most expensive hurricane in the United States, up to that point (behind Hurricane Betsy).[13] The storm directly killed 143 people along Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana.

In December 1993, the City annexed {{convert|33|sqmi}} north of Gulfport making it the second largest city in Mississippi.

On August 29, 2005, Gulfport was hit by the strong east side of [[Hurricane Katrina]], and much of Gulfport was flooded or destroyed (see details below).  Much of Gulfport was also severely damaged by [[Hurricane Camille]] on August 17, 1969.

==Geography and Climate==
Gulfport is located at 30°24'6&quot; North, 89°4'34&quot; W (30.401641, &amp;minus;89.076169).{{GR|1}}

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city had a total area of {{convert|166.4|km2|abbr=on|disp=flip}}, of which {{convert|147.4|km2|abbr=on|disp=flip}} is land and {{convert|19.0|km2|abbr=on|disp=flip}} (11.40%) is water.

[[Image:Mississippi-Coast-towns-NOAA.jpg|center|thumb|400px| '''Gulfport, Mississippi''' (map center) is east of [[Long Beach, MS|Long Beach]], west of [[Biloxi, MS|Biloxi]], along the [[Gulf of Mexico]].]]

Gulfport has a [[humid subtropical climate]], which is strongly moderated by the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. Winters are short and generally warm, cold spells do occur, but seldom last long. Snow flurries are rare in the city, with no notable accumulation occurring most years. Summers are generally long, hot and humid, though the city's proximity to the Gulf prevents extreme summer highs, as seen farther inland. Gulfport is subject to extreme weather, most notably [[tropical storm]] activity through the Gulf of Mexico.

According to the [[census]] of 2010, there were 69,220 people residing in the city. The [[population density]] was 1,191.4 people per square mile (459.9/km²). The city had 50,825 or 74.97% of its population at the age of 18 and above. The racial makeup of the city was 56.86% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 36.07% [[African American (U.S. Census)|African American]], 0.39% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 1.69% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], 0.14% [[Pacific Islander (U.S. Census)|Pacific Islander]], 2.13% from [[Race (U.S. Census)|other races]], and 2.73% from two or more races. Results show that 5.19% of the population was [[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic]]/[[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]] of any race.

There were 31,602 housing units at an average density of 555.4 per square mile (214.4/km²). The city had 83.24% of housing units occupied. There were an average of 2.57 persons living in each occupied housing unit.

Comparing the 2000 and 2010 Census, the population of the city went down while the total number of housing units rose. This can be attributed to [[Hurricane Katrina]], which destroyed housing and displaced people. New housing development has continued with a mixture of redevelopment from hurricane damage, though not all of the displaced population returned.

As of the [[census]] of 2000, there were 26,943 households out of which 32.1% have children under the age of 18 living with them, 42.6% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 18.2% had a female householder with no husband present, and 34.5% were non-families. 27.7% of all households were made up of individuals and 8.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.51 and the average family size was 3.07.

In Gulfport, the population dispersal was 26.0% under the age of 18, 11.1% from 18 to 24, 30.4% from 25 to 44, 21.1% from 45 to 64, and 11.4% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 34 years. For every 100 females there were 98.2 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 96.1 males. The median income for a household in the city was $32,779, and the median income for a family was $39,213. Males had a median income of $29,220 versus $21,736 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the city was $17,554. 17.7% of the population and 14.1% of families were below the [[poverty line]]. Out of the total population, 25.8% of those under the age of 18 and 13.7% of those 65 and older were living below the poverty line.

Gulfport is the location of [[Gulfport-Biloxi International Airport]]. The airport suffered extensive damage due to Hurricane Katrina. A major renovation project is for the most part completed and it has resumed commercial air service. New airlines are being regularly added.

On August 29, 2005, Gulfport was hit by the strong eastern side of [[Hurricane Katrina]]. Much of the city was flooded or destroyed in one day by the strong, hurricane-force winds which lasted over 16 hours and a storm surge exceeding 28 feet (9&amp;nbsp;m) in some sections.&lt;ref name=CNN360Tuchman29&gt;Gary Tuchman, Transcript of &quot;Anderson Cooper 360 Degrees&quot; (2006-08-29) 19:00 ET, ''CNN'', CNN.com web: [http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0508/29/acd.01.html CNN-ACooper082906]: GARY TUCHMAN, CNN Correspondent: Responds to Anderson Cooper that it felt like it would never end, saying winds were at least 100 miles per hour in Gulfport for seven hours, between about 7:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. For another five or six hours, on each side of that, they [Gulfport] had hurricane-force winds over 75 miles per hour; much of the city [Gulfport, Mississippi, in Harrison County] of 71,000 was then under water.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hurricane Katrina damaged over 40 Mississippi libraries, gutting the Gulfport Public Library, first floor, and breaking windows on the second floor, beyond repair, requiring total reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Hurricane Katrina Related Damages to Public Libraries in Mississippi&quot; (September 2005), Mississippi Library Commission, web:[http://www.ala.org/ala/cro/katrina/MSPL_Katrina_Damage.pdf ALA-Katrina].&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Sun Herald]]'' newspaper in Biloxi-Gulfport, under the executive editor [[Stanley R. Tiner]], won the 2006 [[Pulitzer Prize]] in journalism for its Katrina coverage.

'''Rosedale''' is a city in [[Bolivar County, Mississippi|Bolivar County]], [[Mississippi]], [[United States]]. The population was 2,414 at the 2000 census.

It is the same &quot;Rosedale&quot; that [[blues]]man [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]] referenced in his song [[Travelling Riverside Blues|&quot;Traveling Riverside Blues]].&quot; Locals claim that [[Robert Johnson (musician)#Devil legend|Johnson sold his soul to the Devil]] at the intersection of Mississippi state highways [[Mississippi Highway 1|1]] and [[Mississippi Highway 8|8]], on the south end of town, and that he tells this story metaphorically in &quot;[[Cross Road Blues]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Tributes to these songs have been recorded by many artists, notably a live performance titled &quot;[[Cross Road Blues|Crossroads]]&quot; by [[Cream (band)|Cream]] in 1968, and one of &quot;Traveling Riverside Blues&quot; by [[Led Zeppelin]] in 1997 on their [[BBC Sessions (Led Zeppelin album)|''BBC Sessions'']] album. Johnson's deal with the Devil is mentioned as occurring in Rosedale in 1930 in an episode of the TV series ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]].''&lt;/ref&gt;  However, a number of other [[Mississippi Delta|Delta]] municipalities claim that the transaction took place in or near their boundaries.

==History==
[[File:Grace Episcopal Church, Rosedale, MS.JPG|thumb|right|[[Grace Episcopal Church (Rosedale, Mississippi)|Grace Episcopal Church]] in Rosedale, Mississippi, is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Bolivar County, Mississippi|National Register of Historic Places]]]]
This area in the nineteenth century was one of extensive cotton plantations, with [[slavery in the United States|enslaved]] laborers. After the [[American Civil War]], some [[freedmen]] managed to clear and buy land in the bottomlands, with many becoming landowners before the end of the nineteenth century. By 1910, declining conditions had forced most to lose their land.&lt;ref&gt;John C. Willis, ''Forgotten Time: The Yazoo-Mississippi Delta after the Civil War''. Charlottesville: University of Virginia Press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Others stayed to work as sharecroppers and laborers. Beginning in the early twentieth century, thousands of blacks left Mississippi as part of the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], north by railroad to [[Chicago]] and other Midwestern industrial cities, but others remained where they had been for generations, with strong local ties.

The Mississippi Blues Commission placed a historic marker at Rosedale's former [[Yazoo and Mississippi Valley Railroad]] depot site, designating it as a site on the [[Mississippi Blues Trail]]. The marker commemorates the sites in the original lyrics of legendary 
blues artist [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]]'s &quot;[[Traveling Riverside Blues]].&quot; He traced the railway route which ran south from [[Friars Point]] to Rosedale among other stops, including [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]] and north to [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]]. The marker emphasizes that a common theme of blues songs was riding on the railroad, which was seen as a [[metaphor]] for travel and escape.&lt;!--dead link.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Columbus''' is a city in [[Lowndes County, Mississippi|Lowndes County]], [[Mississippi]] that lies above the [[Tombigbee River]]. It is approximately {{convert|146|mi|km|0|sp=us}} northeast of [[Jackson, MS|Jackson]], {{convert|92|mi|km|0|sp=us}} north of [[Meridian, MS|Meridian]], {{convert|63|mi|km|0|sp=us}} south of [[Tupelo, MS|Tupelo]], {{convert|60|mi|km|0|sp=us}} northwest of [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama]], and {{convert|120|mi|km|0|sp=us}} west of [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], [[Alabama]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CVB&quot;&gt;[http://www.columbus-ms.org/about_columbus/index.html Columbus Convention and Visitors Bureau]&lt;/ref&gt; The population was 25,944 at the 2000 census. It is the [[county seat]] of [[Lowndes County, Mississippi|Lowndes County]]{{GR|6}} and the principal city of the [[Columbus, Mississippi Micropolitan Statistical Area|Columbus]] [[Micropolitan Statistical Area]], which is part of the larger [[Columbus-West Point Combined Statistical Area|Columbus-West Point]] [[Combined Statistical Area]]. Columbus is also part of the area of northeast Mississippi called [[Golden Triangle (Mississippi)|The Golden Triangle]], consisting of Columbus, [[West Point, MS|West Point]] and [[Starkville, MS|Starkville]], in the counties of Lowndes, [[Clay County, MS|Clay]] and [[Oktibbeha]].

==History==
The first record of the site of Columbus in Western history is found in the annals of the explorer [[Hernando de Soto (explorer)|Hernando de Soto]], who is reputed to have crossed the nearby [[Tombigbee River]] on his search for [[El Dorado]]. However, the site does not enter the main continuity of American history until December 1810, when [[John Pitchlynn]], the U.S. interpreter for the [[Choctaw]] Nation, moved to [[Plymouth Bluff]] where he built a home, established a farm and transacted Choctaw Agency business.

===Founding===
Columbus was founded in 1821. Before its incorporation, the town site was referred to informally as ''Possum Town'', a name which was given by the local Native Americans.  The name Possum Town remains the town's nickname among locals.  Columbus came into existence as a result of the failure of a flooded settlement across the river, [[Plymouth, Mississippi|Plymouth]], which was established in 1817. [[Plymouth Bluff]] (above the ruined settlement) is today an environmental center for [[Mississippi University for Women]]. The survivors of the flood moved to a site occupied by Thomas Moore and Dr. [[Gideon Lincecum]]. Silas McBee suggested the name ''Columbus''; in return, a small local creek bears McBee's name.&lt;ref&gt;Rowland, Dunbar, ed. Mississippi, Comprising Sketches of Counties, Towns, Events, Institutions, and Persons arranged in Cyclopedic Form in three volumes. Vol. 2. Atlanta: Southern Historical Publishing Association, 1907, pages 134-137.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first actions taken by the city's founders was to establish a public school; Franklin Academy remains in operation to the present day as Mississippi's first public school.  However, its status as such awaited a correction to the territorial boundary of Mississippi and Alabama which, demarcated only a year earlier, had Franklin Academy in Alabama.  In fact, during its early post-Mississippi-founding history, the city of Columbus itself was still referred to as ''Columbus, Alabama.''

===Civil War and aftermath===
During the [[American Civil War]], Columbus was a hospital town. However, Columbus also had an arsenal that made gunpowder, handguns and a few cannons. Because of this the Union ordered the invasion of Columbus but was stopped by General Nathan Bedford Forrest.This is substantiated in the book &quot;The Battle of West Point: Confederate Triumph at Ellis Bridge&quot; by John McBride. Many of the casualties from the [[Battle of Shiloh]] were brought there, and thousands were buried in the town's Friendship Cemetery. One of the hospitals was located at the still-operating Annunciation Catholic Church, built in 1863. The decision of a group of ladies to decorate the Union and Confederate graves with flowers together on April 25, 1866, is an early example of what became [[Memorial Day]]. A poet, [[Francis Miles Finch]], happened to be in town that day and commemorated the occasion with the poem &quot;[[The Blue and the Grey]]&quot;.

As a result of Nathan Bedford Forrest preventing the Union Army from reaching Columbus, the Antebellum homes of Columbus were spared from being burned or destroyed, making its collection second only to [[Natchez, Mississippi|Natchez]] as the most extensive in Mississippi. This again is substantiated in the book &quot;The Battle of West Point: Confederate Triumph at Ellis Bridge&quot; by John McBride. These antebellum homes may be toured during the annual Pilgrimage in which the residences open their homes to tourists from around the country.

During the war, Columbus attorney [[Jacob H. Sharp]] served as a [[Brigadier General (CSA)|brigadier general]] in the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate Army]]. After the war, he owned the Columbus ''Independent'' newspaper and served four years representing the district in the [[Mississippi House of Representatives]].&lt;ref&gt;Eicher, John H., and [[David J. Eicher|Eicher, David J.]], ''Civil War High Commands'', Stanford University Press, 2001, page 481. ISBN 0-8047-3641-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century===
Columbus has hosted [[Columbus Air Force Base]] (CAFB) since [[World War II]]. CAFB was founded as a flight training school. After a stint in the 1950s and 1960s as a [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC) base (earning Columbus a spot in [[Soviet Union]] target lists), CAFB returned to its original role. Today, it is one of only four basic Air Force flight training bases in the United States, and prized as the only one where regular flight conditions may be experienced. Despite this, CAFB has repeatedly hung in the balance during [[Base Realignment and Closure]] (BRAC) hearings.

Columbus boasted a number of industries during the mid-20th century, including the world's largest [[toilet seat]] manufacturer, Sanderson Plumbing Products, and major mattress, furniture and textile plants. Most of these had closed by 2000. A series of new plants at the [[Golden Triangle Regional Airport]], including the [[Severstal]] mill, the [[American Eurocopter]] factory, the [[Paccar]] engine plant and the [[Aurora Flight Sciences]] facility, are revitalizing the local economy.

Columbus is the birthplace of famous playwright [[Tennessee Williams]], author of ''[[Cat on a Hot Tin Roof]]'' and ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (play)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]''. His birthplace, formerly the rectory of nearby St. Paul's Episcopal Church, is now the welcome center for Columbus (300 Main St., Columbus). Columbus is also the birthplace of baseball announcer [[Red Barber]]; boxing's first three-time world heavyweight champion, [[Henry Armstrong]]; rock singer [[Andrew Wood (singer)|Andrew Wood]]; the parents of [[Grammy]]-award winning bluegrass musician [[Alison Krauss]]; [[American Idol]] contestant [[Jasmine Murray]]; and bluegrass musician [[Ruby Jane Smith]]. [[Lenny Fant]], award-winning [[basketball]] coach at the [[University of Louisiana at Monroe]] from 1957–1979, graduated from Lee High School in Columbus but was born in [[Hamilton, Alabama|Hamilton]], Alabama.

===Recent history===
Columbus has made the national news at least three times in the past two decades. On June 12, 1990, a fireworks factory exploded, detonating a blast felt as far as 30 miles away from Columbus. Two workers were killed in the blast.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.latimes.com/1990-06-13/news/mn-207_1_fireworks-factory&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1990/Explosions-At-Mississippi-Fireworks-Plant-Kill-Two/id-b6bf032a0255a80153130be35b43e3be&lt;/ref&gt; On June 26, 2000, the television show ''[[48 Hours (TV series)|48 Hours]]'' did an investigative report of five murders of senior citizens occurring in an 18-month period between late 1997 and early 1999.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18559_162-209570.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tvguide.com/detail/tv-show.aspx?tvobjectid=195619&amp;more=ucepisodelist&amp;episodeid=3170119&lt;/ref&gt; On February 16, 2001, straightline winds measured at 74 miles per hour destroyed many homes and trees but fortunately resulted in no fatalities. The city was declared a federal disaster area the next day by President [[George W. Bush]]. Less than two years later in November 2002, a tornado hit Columbus and caused more damage to the city,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tornadoproject.com/past/pastts02.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nws.noaa.gov/os/assessments/pdfs/veteran.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; including the Mississippi University for Women.&lt;ref&gt;http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/02/14/16963369-tornado-damage-to-university-of-southern-mississippi-estimated-in-tens-of-millions?lite&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.muw.edu/publicaffairs/2006_prnews/061003_miller.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Columbus won a Great American Main Street Award from the National Trust by Historic Preservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.columbusmainstreet.com | title=Welcome to the Columbus Main Street Website | work=Columbus Main Street | accessdate=December 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, The Heritage Academy Patriots won the [[Mississippi Association of Independent Schools]] Class AAA, Division 2 state football championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cdispatch.com/sports/article.asp?aid=20228&amp;TRID=1 | title=State Champions: Patriots cap memorable year as No. 1 | first=Adam | last=Minichino | date=November 11, 2012 | accessdate=March 4, 2013 | work=The Commercial Dispatch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|57.8|km2|sqmi|1|sp=us}} − {{convert|55.5|km2|sqmi|1|sp=us}} of it is land and {{convert|2.3|km2|sqmi|1|sp=us}} of it is water.  Large lakes and rivers run nearby the area such as the Buttahatchee River in Northern Lowndes County that defines the border between Lowndes and Monroe counties Mississippi; in the middle of the City of Columbus and Lowndes County Lies the Luxapalila Creek, and the Tombigbee River with the Stennis Lock and Dam impounding Columbus Lake.  Columbus is a relatively flat place in the Northern part of Lowndes County the land rises for a short period of time into hills and bluffs, in the Southern/Eastern part of the county the land has rolling hills that quickly turn into flatland floodplains that dominate this county.  This county lies in the Black Prairie Geographic Region, and the Northeastern Hills Region of the state/area. Forests, Prairies, Forests, and Floodplain Forests lie here.  Surprisingly the soil quality is poor in the eastern part of the county, otherwise the soil is relatively fertile in most of the county.

==Education==
Columbus is home to a state university, the [[Mississippi University for Women]]. The MUW campus is also home to the [[Mississippi School for Mathematics and Science]], a state-funded school for academically gifted high school juniors and seniors.

The city's public high school (under the [[Columbus Municipal School District]]) is [[Columbus High School (Mississippi)|Columbus High School]], located in the eastern part of town. It is the largest high school in the city and fifth largest in the state, enrolling approximately 1370 students. Columbus High School was formed by the merger of the city's two previous high schools, [[Stephen D. Lee]] High School and Caldwell High School; the schools were merged in 1992 and the campuses in 1997. Columbus is also home to the oldest public elementary school in Mississippi, [[Franklin Elementary (Columbus, Mississippi)|Franklin Academy Elementary]], founded in 1821. Lee High School was desegregated in 1970 and received a state award for the high school with the best race relations. A race relations committee was formed consisting of black and white students. The students decided to have both white and black homecoming courts so as to prevent sides being taken along racial lines. However, black students were allowed to vote for the white homecoming court and vice versa. The school went undefeated in football in 1970, which helped unite the student body. Students were ranked based on achievement score tests and divided into 3 groups in order to allow each group to learn at their own pace. This practice was in place prior to integration. It was continued after integration for a period but was later ruled to be illegal by a Federal court.

The [[Lowndes County School District]] operates three high schools—Caledonia, New Hope, and West Lowndes—fed by similarly named elementary and middle schools.

Columbus has several private schools, including:
* Immanuel Center for Christian Education (K-3 through 12)
* Heritage Academy ([[Christian]], [[K-12]])
* Annunciation Catholic School ([[Catholic]], [[K-8 (education)|K-8]])
* Victory Christian Academy (Christian, K-12)
* Palmer Home for Children ([[orphanage]])

==Media==
Columbus' city newspapers are the daily (except Saturdays) ''[[Commercial Dispatch]]'' and the weekly ''[[Columbus Packet]]''. One television station, [[WCBI-TV]], the [[CBS]] affiliate, is located in the city's historic downtown area; it broadcasts [[The CW Television Network|CW]] and [[MyNetworkTV]] programming on digital subchannels.

Two magazines are published in Columbus: ''[[The New Power Magazine]]'', a regional urban magazine, and ''[[Columbus Fire and Rescue Magazine]]''.

Columbus is also served by television stations from the Columbus / Tupelo / West Point DMA, ranked No. 133 nationally

Radio Stations include:

*103.1 Sports Talk/ESPN Radio
*94.1 Top 40
*99.9 Rock

Columbus lies on U.S. Highways [[US 82|82]] and [[US 45|45]]. It is also served by state routes [[Mississippi State Highway 12|12]], [[Mississippi State Highway 50|50]], [[Mississippi State Highway 69|69]], and [[Mississippi State Highway 182|182]]. Columbus is the eastern terminus of the [[Columbus and Greenville Railway]]; it is also served by the [[BNSF Railway]] (on the original right-of-way of the [[St. Louis - San Francisco Railway]]), the [[Norfolk Southern]], and the [[Canadian National Railway|CN]] (using the original right-of-way of the [[Gulf, Mobile, and Ohio]]). The local airport is [[Golden Triangle Regional Airport]].  The airport currently has three flights a day to [[Atlanta]].
The city is located on the east bank of the [[Tombigbee River]] and the associated [[Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway]]. [[Columbus Lake (Mississippi)|Columbus Lake]], formed by the [[John C. Stennis Lock and Dam]], is approximately two miles north of downtown. The [[Luxapalila Creek]] runs through the town, separating East Columbus from Columbus proper (both are within city limits). The Lux, as it is locally known, joins the Tombigbee about three miles south of downtown.

==Hurricane Katrina==

[[Image:FEMA - 16964 - Photograph by John Fleck taken on 10-04-2005 in Mississippi.jpg|thumb|300px|The Bay bridge on US Highway 90, damaged by Hurricane Katrina]]

On August 29, 2005 at 10:00 a.m. CDT, [[Hurricane Katrina]] made its final landfall near Bay St. Louis, at the mouth of the [[Pearl River (Mississippi-Louisiana)|Pearl River]], with a {{convert|28|ft|m|sing=on}} storm surge.  Hurricane Katrina came ashore during the high tide of 9:15AM, +2.3&amp;nbsp;feet more,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;2005 NOAA Tide Predictions: St. Louis Bay entrance&quot; (2005), tide on 29-Aug-2005, ''NOAA'', web: [http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/get_predictions.shtml?year=2005&amp;stn=0551+South+Pass&amp;secstn=St.+Louis+Bay+entrance&amp;thh=%2b3&amp;thm=17&amp;tlh=%2b2&amp;tlm=57&amp;hh=*1.36&amp;hl=*1.36 NOAA-tide-tables].&lt;/ref&gt; causing a storm tide over {{convert|30|ft|m}} deep. USGS Topographical maps show a common {{convert|25|ft|m}} elevation contour line running throughout a ridge along old HWY 90 (Old Spanish Trail) in the western edge of the city. It was primarily this area which did not see the surge inundation of Hurricane Katrina.

The town was notable for being the highest point on the entire [[Gulf of Mexico]] [[coastline]] (approx. 12&amp;nbsp;feet), its pristine beaches, and esteemed restaurants such as Trapani's.

The final death toll from Hurricane Katrina is not yet known.

Hurricane Katrina damaged over 40 Mississippi libraries, with severe roof and water damage to the Bay St. Louis Public Library. The library reopened to the public on October 12, 2005, and is awaiting repairs.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Hurricane Katrina Related Damages to Public Libraries in Mississippi&quot; (September 2005), Mississippi Library Commission, [http://www.ala.org/ala/cro/katrina/MSPL_Katrina_Damage.pdf (ALA-Katrina)].&lt;/ref&gt; The Bay St. Louis Bridge on US Highway 90, was also damaged, with many bridge sections downdropped at the west edges.  The destroyed bridge was replaced by a new St. Louis Bay Bridge, which was awarded America's Transportation Award.  [http://www.americastransportationaward.org/Default.aspx?ContentID=45]  The new bridge features a pedestrian bridge with an art walk featuring the works of local artists.  [http://www.hancockchamber.org/Events/Bridgefest2009/bridgefestartists.asp]

Currently, the underground utility infrastructure in Bay St. Louis is receiving a federally funded total overhaul and replacement.

==Hurricane Katrina==
While Picayune received extensive damage from [[Hurricane Katrina]], it was not as severe as in other nearby cities. This has caused it to become the permanent home for many who relocated from the New Orleans area and the Mississippi Gulf Coast and were seeking a safer homesite with easy commuting to those areas. The bulk of the damage in Picayune was caused by winds from the hurricane. This resulted in widespread roof, window and fence damage. The wind also caused hundreds, if not thousands, of downed trees and power outages for up to several months.

==History==
{{refimprove section|date=May 2012}}
[[File:Choctaw-Nation.png|thumb|left|120px|The entire Choctaw Nation's location compared to the U.S. state of Mississippi.]]

The area which is now Vicksburg was previously part of the [[Natchez people|Natchez]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]s' territory. The first [[European Americans|Europeans]] who settled the area were [[French people|French]] colonists, who built [[Fort St. Pierre Site|Fort-Saint-Pierre]] in 1719 on the high bluffs overlooking the [[Yazoo River]] at present-day [[Redwood, Mississippi|Redwood]]. On 28 November 1729, the Natchez [[Natchez Massacre|attacked]] the fort and plantations in and around the present-day city of [[Natchez, Mississippi|Natchez]], killing several hundred settlers, including the Jesuit Father [[Paul Du Poisson]], and carrying off a number of women and children. The Natchez War was a disaster for French Louisiana as the colonial population of the Natchez District never recovered.  However, with the help of the [[Choctaw]], traditional enemies of the Natchez, the French defeated and scattered the Natchez and their allies, the Yazoo.

The Choctaw Nation took over the area by right of conquest and inhabited it for several decades.  Under pressure from the US government, in 1801 the Choctaw agreed to cede nearly {{convert|2000000|acre|km2}} of land to the US under the terms of the [[Treaty of Fort Adams]]. The treaty was the first of a series that eventually led to the [[Indian Removal|removal]] of most of the Choctaw to [[Indian Territory]] west of the Mississippi River in 1830.  Nonetheless, many Choctaw remained in Mississippi, citing article XIV of the [[Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek]].

In 1790, the Spanish founded a military outpost on the site, which they called [[Fort Nogales]] (''nogales'' meaning &quot;walnut trees&quot;).  When the Americans took possession in 1798, they changed the name to [[Walnut Hills]]. The small village was incorporated in 1825 as Vicksburg, named after [[Newitt Vick]], a [[Methodist]] [[minister (Christianity)|minister]] who had established a mission on the site.

In 1835, during the [[John Murrell (bandit)|Murrell Excitement]], a mob from Vicksburg attempted to expel the gamblers from the city, because the citizens were sick of the rougher element treating the city with nothing but contempt.  Five gamblers who had shot and killed a local doctor were hanged as a result.&lt;ref&gt;http://masglp.olemiss.edu/Water%20Log/WL18/wlvicks.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:View of Vicksburg, Mississippi.jpg|thumb|right|View of Vicksburg in 1855]]
During the [[American Civil War]], the city finally had to surrender during the [[Siege of Vicksburg]], after which the [[Union Army]] gained control of the entire [[Mississippi River]]. The 47-day siege was intended to starve the city into submission.  Otherwise its location atop a high bluff overlooking the Mississippi River proved impregnable to assault by federal troops. The surrender of Vicksburg by Confederate General [[John C. Pemberton]] on July 4, 1863, together with the defeat of General [[Robert E. Lee]] at [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]] the day before, has historically marked the [[Turning point of the American Civil War|turning point]] in the Civil War. It has been claimed that the residents of Vicksburg did not celebrate the national holiday of [[Independence Day (United States)|4th of July]] again until 1945 but this is inaccurate. Large Fourth of July celebrations were being held by 1907 and informal celebrations took place before that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waldrep|first=Christopher|title=Vicksburg's Long Shadow: The Civil War Legacy Of Race And Remembrance|year=2005|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0742548688|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=esDgeo7QYJEC&amp;pg=PA247&amp;dq=vicksburg+++celebrate+4th+of+July+newspapers&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QH4OUdOBNsyb1AW4rYGQCQ&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=vicksburg%20%20%20celebrate%204th%20of%20July%20newspapers&amp;f=false|page=247}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Historian Michael G. Ballard, in his ''Vicksburg'' campaign history, pp. 420-21, claims that this story has little foundation in fact. Although it is unknown whether city officials sanctioned the day as a local holiday, Southern observances of July 4 were for many years characterized more by family picnics than by formal city or county activities.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Mississippi River floating dry dock - Vicksburg.jpg|thumb|left|Floating [[drydock]] in Vicksburg, circa 1905]]
Because of the city's location on the Mississippi River, in the 19th century it built an extensive trade from the river's prodigious [[steamboat]] traffic. Between 1881 and 1894, the [[Anchor Line (riverboat company)|Anchor Line]], a prominent steamboat company on the Mississippi River from 1859 to 1898, operated a steamboat called the ''City of Vicksburg''. In 1876 a Mississippi River flood cut off the large [[meander]] flowing past Vicksburg, leaving limited access to the new channel.

The [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] diverted the [[Yazoo River]] in 1903 into the old, shallowing channel to rejuvenate the waterfront. Railroad access to the west was by transfer steamers and ferry [[barges]] until a combination railroad-highway bridge was built in 1929. This is the only Mississippi River rail crossing between [[Baton Rouge]] and [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]].  It is the only highway crossing between Natchez and [[Greenville, Mississippi|Greenville]].

[[Interstate 20]] bridged the river after 1973.  Freight rail traffic still crosses via the old bridge. North-South transportation links are by the Mississippi River and [[U.S. Highway 61]].
[[File:Mississippi River Commission Building Vicksburg.jpg|thumb|right|The historic 1894 Mississippi River Commission Building]]

On March 12, 1894, the popular soft drink [[Coca-Cola]] was bottled for the first time in Vicksburg by [[Joseph A. Biedenharn]], a local [[confectionery|confectioner]]. Today, surviving nineteenth-century Biedenharn [[Soft drink|soda]] [[bottle]]s are prized by collectors of Coca-Cola memorabilia.  His original candy store has been renovated as the Biedenharn Coca-Cola Museum.

Vicksburg served as the primary refugee gathering point, and relief parties put up temporary housing during the [[Great Mississippi Flood of 1927]].  It submerged a large percentage of the [[Mississippi Delta]]. That flood was the impetus towards the US Army Corps of Engineers establishing the Waterways Experiment Station as the primary hydraulics laboratory, to develop protection of important croplands and cities from the river.  Now known as the [[Engineer Research and Development Center]], it applies military engineering, information technology, environmental engineering, hydraulic engineering, and geotechnical engineering.

In December 1953, a [[1953 Vicksburg, Mississippi tornado outbreak|severe tornado]] swept across Vicksburg causing 38 deaths and destroying nearly 1,000 buildings.

===Racial unrest===
In the first few years after the war, the Ku Klux Klan became active but was suppressed about 1870.  By the mid-1870s, new paramilitary groups had arisen in the [[Deep South]].  On December 7, 1874 in the Vicksburg Massacre, white men killed at least 50 black residents.  Alternate accounts {{Who|date=February 2010}} estimated that upwards of 300 blacks were killed in the city and the surrounding area.  The [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]], a [[paramilitary]] organization that acted as an arm of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], was active in Vicksburg and other Mississippi areas.  President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] sent Federal troops to Vicksburg to quell the violence.  In the aftermath of the Vicksburg Massacre, other states adopted what they called the Mississippi Plan.  At election times, paramilitary groups' intimidated black Republican voters into staying away from the polls, thereby preventing the election of any Republicans or blacks, despite their legal right to vote. By the late 1870s, the Democrats had regained power in state legislatures across the former Confederacy.

[[Lynchings]] and other forms of [[vigilante]] violence continued to occur in Vicksburg after the start of the 20th century as well.  In May 1903, for example, two black men charged with murdering a planter were taken from jail by a mob of 200 farmers and lynched before they went to trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B06E7DA1F30E733A25757C0A9639C946297D6CF&amp;scp=8&amp;sq=vicksburg+lynched&amp;st=p

In 2001, a group of Vicksburg residents visited the [[Paducah, Kentucky#Contemporary Paducah|Paducah, Kentucky mural project]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.riverfrontmurals.com/muralcommunity.htm Vicksburg Riverfront Murals ''It Took A Community To Raise A Mural!'']&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, the Vicksburg Riverfront [[mural]]s program was begun by [[Louisiana]] mural artist [[Robert Dafford]] and his team on the floodwall located on the waterfront in downtown.&lt;ref name=&quot;riverfrontmurals.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.riverfrontmurals.com/indexmain.htm Vicksburg Riverfront Murals &quot;Celebrating Vicksburg:A Great American Community&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; Subjects for the murals were drawn from the history of Vicksburg and the surrounding area and include President Theodore Roosevelt's bear hunt, the [[SS Sultana]], the [[Sprague (towboat)|Sprague]], the [[Siege of Vicksburg]], the [[Kings Crossing site]], [[Willie Dixon]], the [[Great Mississippi Flood of 1927|Flood of 1927]], the [[1953 Vicksburg, Mississippi tornado outbreak]], Rosa A. Temple High School and the [[Vicksburg National Military Park]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.riverfrontmurals.com/muralssponsors.htm Vicksburg Riverfront Murals]&lt;/ref&gt; The project was finished in 2009 with the completion of the Jitney Jungle/Glass Kitchen mural.&lt;ref name=&quot;riverfrontmurals.com&quot;/&gt; In the fall of 2010, a new 55 foot mural was painted on a section of wall on Grove Hill across the street from the original project by former Dafford muralists Benny Graeff and [[Herb Roe]]. The mural's subject is the annual &quot;Run thru History&quot; held in the Vicksburg National Military Park.&lt;ref&gt;[http://issuu.com/vicksburgpost/docs/081110 Mural on Grove hill to highlight Run Thru History]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://issuu.com/vicksburgpost/docs/101310 Ready to Roll]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

===The early 1900s===
Long Beach began as an agricultural town, based around its [[radish]] industry.  But on August 10, 1905, Long Beach incorporated and became another city on the Mississippi Gulf Coast.  As the years went on, the city moved from its agricultural heritage and moved toward tourism with the beach and high-rise condominiums becoming increasingly popular.

=== &quot;The Radish capital of the world&quot; ===
Long Beach's early economy was based largely upon radishes.  Logging initially drove the local economy, but when the area's virgin yellow pine forests became depleted, row crops were planted on the newly cleared land.&lt;ref name=&quot;friendly&quot;&gt;[http://www.sunherald.com/181/v-print/story/100052.html Long Beach is a friendly city] ''The Sun-Herald''.  Retrieved October 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

A productive truck farming town in the early 20th century, citizens of Long Beach proclaimed the city to be the &quot;Radish Capital of the World&quot;.  The city was especially known for its cultivation of the Long Red radish variety, a favorite beer hall staple in the northern US at the time.  In 1921, a bumper crop resulted in the shipment of over 300 train loads of Long Beach's Long Red radishes to northern states.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Ellen Alexander. ''Rosalie and Radishes: A history of Long Beach, Mississippi''. Hagerstown Bookbinding &amp; Printing Co, 2001 edition&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mdah.state.ms.us/pubs/mhn/may02index.html Mississippi History Newsletter] Volume 44 No. 5. May 2002.  Retrieved October 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, the Long Red radishes for which Long Beach was known fell into disfavor, and the rise of the common button radish caused a dramatic decline in the cultivation of this crop in the area.&lt;ref name=&quot;friendly&quot;/&gt;

=== Hurricane Katrina ===
[[Image:Katrina LB.JPG|thumb|| The impact of [[Hurricane Katrina]] on the Long Beach shoreline]]
Nineteen days following the city's [[centennial]], [[Hurricane Katrina]] struck the city on August 29, 2005, destroying more than 90% of all buildings along the [[Gulf of Mexico]].{{Clarify|date=May 2012}}&lt;!--Surely not from the Yucatan all the way around to Key West. 90% of all buildings in Long Beach? On the Mississippi Gulf Coast?--&gt;  Many Long Beach residents were left without homes or those that took on much water and or wind damage.

Hurricane Katrina damaged over 40 Mississippi libraries, heavily damaging the Long Beach Public Library.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Hurricane Katrina Related Damages to Public Libraries in Mississippi&quot; (September 2005), Mississippi Library Commission, web:[http://www.ala.org/ala/cro/katrina/MSPL_Katrina_Damage.pdf ALA-Katrina].&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of [[Long Beach, California]], held a fund raiser to help its eponymous relative.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.longbeachcares.net Long Beach Cares]&lt;/ref&gt;  The city of [[Peoria, Arizona]], adopted Long Beach and provided both public and private resources.  This resulted in a close relationship between the two communities.

== Today ==
Today, the city is still recovering from Hurricane Katrina.  More and more residents are moving in, due to beaches and condominiums setting up in the area.

Many restaurants have returned to Long Beach, such as Harbor View Cafe, Bull's, and Cajun Crawfish Hut, and have given local musicians popularity like Grocery Feet, The Crowd and solo pianist/vocalist Brett Hilbert.

However, the city has not received the full return of businesses due to building codes on the beach put in effect by the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] and Mississippi Emergency Management Agency, and also because of the economic downturn. The city is recovering from Katrina and its citizens are still &quot;the friendly city.&quot;

'''New Albany''' is a city in [[Union County, Mississippi|Union County]], [[Mississippi]], [[United States]]. The population was 8,526 at the 2010 census. New Albany is the [[county seat]] of [[Union County, Mississippi|Union County]]{{GR|6}}. New Albany was first organized in 1840 at the site of a grist mill and saw mill on the [[Tallahatchie River]] and was developed as a river port. The birthplace of author [[William Faulkner]] as well as [[Eli Whiteside]] and [[Bettie Wilson]] and the adopted home of Morris Futorian, father of the Northeast Mississippi furniture industry. As of 2010 New Albany has a population of 8,526 and is known for its education system, well-educated labor force and strong work ethic. The city houses modern factories, robust neighborhoods and vibrant shopping centers, while at the same time preserves its historic downtown area.

Organized in 1840 at the site of a grist mill and a saw mill on the Tallahatchie River near the intersection of two historic Chickasaw Indian trade trails, the town developed as a river port and as a regional center for agriculture and commerce. The Civil War interrupted this progress, however, as Union troops swept through the city and burned all but a few buildings.

Union County was formed from parts of neighboring Lee, Pontotoc, and Tippah Counties in 1870, with New Albany designated as county seat. The city’s new role as a center of government led to renewed economic activity. Citizens’ efforts in the late 1880s to secure a railroad through New Albany were rewarded with two railroads connecting the community to points north, south, east and west. Depot clerk for one of the railroads was the father of William Faulkner. Born in 1897 in a single-story clapboard house, Faulkner went on to write 19 novels and 75 short stories, winning the coveted Nobel Prize and the Pulitzer Prize twice for his work.

'''Greenwood''' is a city in and the [[county seat]] of [[Leflore County, Mississippi|Leflore County]], [[Mississippi]],{{GR|6}} located at the eastern edge of the [[Mississippi Delta]] approximately 96 miles north of [[Jackson, Mississippi]], and 130 miles south of [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Tennessee]]. The population was 16,087 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. It is the principal city of the Greenwood [[Greenwood, Mississippi micropolitan area|Micropolitan Statistical Area]]. The [[Tallahatchie River]] and the [[Yalobusha River]] meet at Greenwood to form the [[Yazoo River]].  Throughout the 1960s Greenwood was the site of major protests and conflicts over racial integration and voting rights during the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–68)|civil rights movement]].

== History ==
[[File:Howard.street.greenwood.ms.postcard.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Howard Street, Greenwood]]
The flood plain of the [[Mississippi River]] has long been an area rich in vegetation and wildlife, feeding off the Mississippi and its numerous tributaries. Long before [[European ethnic groups|European]]s migrated to [[North America|America]], the [[Choctaw]] and [[Chickasaw]] Indian nations settled in the Delta's bottomlands and throughout what is now central Mississippi. They were descended from indigenous peoples who had lived in the area for thousands of years.

In the nineteenth century, the [[Five Civilized Tribes]] suffered increasing encroachment on their territory by European-American settlers from southeastern states. Under pressure from the United States government, in 1830 the Choctaw principal chief [[Greenwood Leflore]] and other Choctaw leaders signed the [[Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek]], ceding most of their remaining land to the United States in exchange for land in what is now southeastern Oklahoma. The government opened the land to settlement by European Americans.  LeFlore came to regret his decision to sign away his people's land, stating in 1843 that he was &quot;sorry to say that the benefits realized from [the treaty] by my people were by no means equal to what I had a right to expect, nor to what they were justly entitled.&quot;&lt;ref name=choctaw&gt;{{cite book|author=Greg O'Brien|title=Pre-removal Choctaw History: Exploring New Paths|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jGFmNPevedUC&amp;pg=PA221|accessdate=13 May 2013|year=2008|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=978-0-8061-3916-6|page=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Euro-American settlement on the banks of the [[Yazoo River]] was a trading post founded by John Williams in 1834&lt;ref name=greenwood&gt;{{cite book|author1=Donny Whitehead|author2=Mary Carol Miller|title=Greenwood|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=mTL6TxmacCwC|accessdate=13 May 2013|date=14 September 2009|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=978-0-7385-6786-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7}} and known as Williams Landing. The settlement quickly blossomed, and in 1844 was incorporated as &quot;Greenwood,&quot; named after Chief [[Greenwood Leflore]]. Growing in the midst of a strong cotton market, the city's success was based on its strategic location in the heart of the Delta; on the easternmost point of the [[alluvial plain]] and astride the [[Tallahatchie River|Tallahatchie]] and the [[Yazoo River|Yazoo]] rivers. The city served as a shipping point for cotton to major markets in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]], [[Memphis, Tennessee]], and [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. Greenwood continued to prosper, based on slave labor on the cotton plantations and in shipping, until the latter part of the [[American Civil War]].

The end of the Civil War in 1865 and the following years of [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] changed the labor market to one of free labor. The state was mostly undeveloped frontier, and many freedmen withdrew from working for others. In the nineteenth century, many blacks managed to clear and buy their own farms in the bottomlands.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated4&quot;&gt;John C. Willis, ''Forgotten Time: The Yazoo-Mississippi Delta after the Civil War''. Charlottesville: University of Virginia Press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; With the disruption of war and changes to labor, cotton production initially declined, reducing the city's previously thriving economy.

The construction of [[Rail transport|railroads]] through the area in the 1880s revitalized the city,&lt;ref name=greenwood/&gt;{{rp|8}} with two rail lines running to downtown Greenwood, close to the Yazoo River, and shortening transportation to markets. Greenwood again emerged as a prime shipping point for cotton. Downtown's Front Street bordering the Yazoo filled with cotton factors and related businesses, earning that section the name Cotton Row. The city continued to prosper in this way well into the 1940s, although cotton production suffered during the infestation of the [[boll weevil]] in the early 20th century. For many years, the bridge over the Yazoo displayed the sign, &quot;World's Largest Inland Long Staple Cotton Market&quot;.

The industry was largely mechanized in the 20th century before [[World War II]]. Since the late 20th century, some Mississippi farmers have begun to replace cotton with corn and soybeans as commodity crops, because of the shift of the textile industry overseas, and stronger prices for those crops.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/06/business/06cotton.html?em Krauss, Clifford. &quot;Mississippi Farmers Trade Cotton Plantings for Corn&quot;], ''The New York Times'', May 5, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Greenwood's Grand Boulevard was once named one of America's 10 most beautiful streets by the U.S. Chambers of Commerce and the Garden Clubs of America. Sally Humphreys Gwin, a charter member of the Greenwood Garden Club, planted the 1,000 oak trees lining Grand Boulevard. In 1950, Gwin received a citation from the National Congress of the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]] in recognition of her work in the conservation of trees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newspaperarchive.com ''Delta Democrat-Times'', November 26, 1956.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=ftJm0hwGAGEC&amp;pg=PA87&amp;lpg=PA87&amp;dq=%22ten+most+beautiful+streets%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jQ4q7RfFuK&amp;sig=gHCc9TWjro3-IoRyD1ShDgwHPhE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=wCTZSda8PNfVlQfsw4G9DA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3 Kirkpatrick, Mario Carter.

===The civil rights era in Greenwood===

In 1955, following the [[Supreme Court]]'s decision in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'', the [[White Citizens' Council]] was founded by [[Robert B. Patterson]] in Greenwood to fight against racial integration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://orig.jacksonsun.com/civilrights/sec2_citizencouncil.shtml | title = White Citizens' Councils aimed to maintain 'Southern way of life' | publisher = Jackson Sun}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local chapters formed across the state, and the white-dominated legislature voted to give the Councils financial support. Having been [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchised]] since 1890, when the state passed a new constitution and related electoral and [[Jim Crow]] laws, the black community had not been able to elect representatives since then to the state or federal legislature, and could not protest such actions.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Edward Cresswell, ''Rednecks, Redeemers and Race: Mississippi after Reconstruction'', Jackson: University Press of Mississippi, 2006, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; The Council paid staff to collect information on black professionals and activists who worked for the restoration of American constitutional civil rights.

====1962–1965====
From 1962 until 1964, Greenwood was a center of protests and voter registration struggles during the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)|Civil Rights Movement]]. The [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee|SNCC]], [[Council of Federated Organizations|COFO]], and the [[Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party|MFDP]] were all active in Greenwood. During this period, hundreds were arrested in nonviolent protests; civil rights activists were subjected to repeated violence, and whites used economic retaliation against African Americans who attempted to register to vote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis62.htm#1962greenwood Mississippi Voter Registration — Greenwood] ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans&lt;/ref&gt;  The city police set their police dog, Tiger, on protesters while white counter-protesters yelled &quot;{{abbr|Sic 'em|Seek him: an order you might give a dog so that they will growl, snarl and perhaps bite at the target.}}&quot; from the sidewalk.&lt;ref name=hend&gt;{{cite book | last = Hendrickson | first = Paul | title = Sons of Mississippi | publisher = [[Alfred A. Knopf]] | year = 2003 | place = New York | isbn = 0-375-40461-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Martin Luther King]] visited the city later in 1963, the [[Ku Klux Klan]] distributed a flyer which read in part (capitalization in original):
{{quotation|TO THOSE OF YOU ''NIGGERS'' WHO GAVE OR GIVE AID AND COMFORT TO THIS CIVIL RIGHTS SCUM, WE ADVISE YOU THAT YOUR IDENTITIES ARE IN THE PROPER HANDS AND ''YOU WILL BE REMEMBERED.''  WE KNOW THAT THE NIGGER OWNER OF COLLINS SHOE SHOP ON JOHNSON STREET &quot;ENTERTAINED&quot; MARTIN LUTHER KING WHEN THE &quot;BIG NIGGER&quot; CAME TO GREENWOOD. WE KNOW OF OTHERS AND WE SAY TO YOU &amp;mdash; AFTER THE SHOWING AND THE PLATE-PASSING AND STUPID STREET DEMONSTRATIONS ARE OVER AND THE IMPORTED AGITATORS HAVE ALL GONE, ONE THING IS SURE AND CERTAIN &amp;mdash; YOU ARE STILL GOING TO BE ''NIGGERS'' AND WE ARE STILL GOING TO BE WHITE MEN.  YOU HAVE CHOSEN YOUR BEDS AND NOW YOU MUST LIE IN THEM.&lt;ref name=hend /&gt;}}

The civil rights protesters in Greenwood in the mid-1960s were supported by an economic boycott organized by the Catholic peace organization [[Pax Christi]], which had a chapter in the city.  Pax Christi's ultimately successful efforts were encouraged by the native Mississippian [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Jackson|Bishop of Jackson]], [[Joseph Bernard Brunini]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Namorato1998&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael V.

In 1964 and 1965 respectively, the [[United States Congress]] passed the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Civil Rights Act]] and [[Voting Rights Act]] to enforce constitutional rights of African Americans and other minorities. For some time, voter registration and elections were monitored by the federal government because of historic discrimination against blacks in the state. The proportion of black citizens of Mississippi who were registered to vote finally roughly matched their proportion of the population in the late 1980s.&lt;ref name=&quot;DavidsonGrofman1994&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Chandler Davidson|author2=Bernard Grofman|title=Quiet Revolution in the South: The Impact of the Voting Rights Act, 1965-1990|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=IAoBiCSt2Q0C&amp;pg=PA354|accessdate=15 September 2012|date=27 May 1994|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-02108-9|page=354}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1966–present====
In June 1966, [[James Meredith]], the first African-American to attend the [[University of Mississippi]], announced that he was going to walk from [[Memphis, Tennessee]] to [[Jackson, Mississippi]] to protest racism.  Meredith was shot about ten days into his &quot;[[March Against Fear]],&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/6/newsid_3009000/3009967.stm|publisher=BBC|title=On this day June 6, 1966: Black civil rights activist shot|accessdate=May 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a number of high profile civil rights leaders, including [[Stokely Carmichael]], vowed to continue his protest.  When the group reached Greenwood on June 17, Carmichael was arrested but released after a few hours.  Later, in Greenwood's Broad Street Park, Carmichael gave his famous [[Black power]] speech, stating: {{quotation|This is the twenty-seventh time I have been arrested&amp;mdash;and I ain't going to jail no more! The only way we gonna stop them white men from whuppin' us is to take over. We been sayin' &quot;freedom&quot; for six years and we ain't got nothin'.

On December 3, 2010, Frederick Jermaine Carter, an African-American man from [[Sunflower County, Mississippi|Sunflower County]] with a history of mental illness, was found dead, hanging from a tree in north Greenwood. The Leflore county coroner ruled the death a suicide, but the [[NAACP]]  was concerned that foul play may have been involved. The NAACP explicitly tied the black community's suspicions about the verdict to the state's history of racial violence against blacks. The reporter Larry Copeland for ''USA Today'' noted that the young [[Emmett Till]] had been lynched 12 miles away in 1955; state Senator David Jordan said, &quot;We're not drawing any conclusions. We're skeptical, and rightfully we should be, given our history. We can't take this lightly. We just have to wait and see.&quot; However, following a thorough investigation, there were never any charges brought against anyone, much less any proof from any source whatsoever that Carter died from anything but his own hand. Found to be mentally ill, it was proven without a doubt that Carter committed suicide, with no assistance from anyone, and in broad daylight. ref Greenwood Commonwealth, that&lt;ref name=&quot;Copeland&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2010-12-06-suicide-mississippi_N.htm | title = NAACP contests suicide as cause of hanged man's death | publisher = USA Today | date = 6 December 2010| author = Larry Copeland | accessdate = 19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pass Christian''', nicknamed '''The Pass''', is a city in [[Harrison County, Mississippi|Harrison County]], [[Mississippi]], [[United States]], along the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. It is part of the [[Gulfport, Mississippi|Gulfport]]&amp;ndash;[[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]] [[Gulfport-Biloxi metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]]. The population was 4,613 at the 2010 census.&lt;ref name=&quot;Census 2010&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://factfinder2.census.gov| title=Profile of General Population and Housing Characteristics: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (DP-1): Pass Christian city, Mississippi| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau, American Factfinder| accessdate=May 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2013}}

=== Pre-history ===
The exact date when Native Americans first arrived in the Gulf Coast area is not known, but artifacts have been found suggesting that humans have inhabited the area for many thousands of years.

Indian mounds can be found throughout the Gulf coast region of southern Mississippi, but many have been destroyed by artifact hunters, farmers, developers, and flooding. A 1768 English map shows one large mound existed on the shore near to Market Street. Others existed at Bayou Portage and the Shelly Plantation on the shore north of the Bay of St. Louis near DeLisle. The mounds and middens in the area containing arrowheads, pottery, and human skeletons were pilfered by amateur archaeologists over the years and many of the items recovered are in private collections. At the border of Pass Christian and Long beach near white Harbor Road meets Hwy. 90 there once existed an Indian village, whose inhabitants were  referred to by locals as &quot;The Pitcher Point Indians&quot;.  The approximate location of the Indian Village is just a few hundred yards east of White Harbor Road. There are no ruins at this location but the beach in this area has produced many arrowheads and pottery shards over the years.

=== Spanish explorers ===
It is likely that Pitcher Point is the location where survivors of the 1528 [[Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca]]  expedition landed naked and starving among a people called the Carnones. This story was told to DeVaca by friendly Indians who stated that, “the natives had killed the Spanish who were so feeble that they could not defend themselves.”

=== French explorers ===
Pass Christian was discovered by French-Canadian explorers in 1699, shortly after the first French colony was established in Biloxi. In June of 1699, while sounding the channel at the Pass Christian peninsula, the French named that channel Passe aux Huîtres for the many oysters they found there. Pass Christian was named for a nearby deepwater pass, which in turn was named for Nicholas Christian L'Adnier,who lived on nearby [[Cat Island (Mississippi)|Cat Island]] beginning in 1746.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ci.pass-christian.ms.us/history/briefhistp5.htm]{{dead link|date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They remained on Ile aux Vaisseaux the following day due to bad weather. On the 13th Iberville and his brother Bienville with a party of thirteen men went ashore, sailing due north from the west end of the island. Their landing would have been somewhere between present-day Beauvoir and Edgewater.

The following morning they explored eastward along the beach, following footprints in the sand until they caught sight of three Indians in a canoe leaving Deer Island. Iberville pursued them across Biloxi Bay, catching up just as they reached shore at Ocean Springs. The younger natives fled into the woods leaving an old and dying man. The Frenchmen made him a bed of straw and built him a fire before withdrawing to make a camp for themselves. Unfortunately, the grasses around him soon caught fire and though the fires were extinguished, the old man died half an hour later.

Iberville’s hunters captured an old woman in the woods and heaped gifts upon her to take to her people. The first diplomatic contact with the native people had been accomplished and the Indians told them of the great river to the west.

On February 27 Iberville set out “in wind and drizzle” with Bienville, M. Sauvolle and about 48 men to visit the Mississippi River. They spent the night near the south end of the later named Bay of Saint Louis and the following day traversed the Breton Sound in fog and rain which continued through the following day. On March 2, running before a storm, they located and entered the mouth of the Mississippi and traveled up stream making contact with various tribes until on March 16 they came upon a decorated pole which marked the boundary between the Houmas and the Bayagoulas tribes. They called the place Red Stick or “Baton Rouge”. On the return trip, Iberville discovered the proof he sought in the form of letter written by Henri de Tonti to La Salle fourteen years earlier. The letter had been left with the chief of the Mongoulachas who bartered it to Iberville for a few hatchets and knives.

Iberville shortly thereafter divided his party into two groups. Bienville returned by the mouth of the Mississippi while Iberville explored the area of Pass Manschac, lakes Maurepas and Pontchartrain and returned to the open water by the Rigolets.

When Iberville departed from his ships on April 27, he instructed them to return to France if he had not returned within one month. On March 30 he camped near the mouth of the Bay of Saint Louis where he built a large fire to signal his return.

The following morning he recognized Cat island, and shortly thereafter reached his ships. About an hour later Bienville and his party arrived.

The unincorporated area north of the bayou, known as [[DeLisle, Mississippi|DeLisle]] (pronounced &quot;duh LILL&quot; or &quot;duh LEEL&quot;), shares a zip code with Pass Christian, but is not within the city limits. DeLisle was formerly known as Wolf Town or Wolftown.

===Battle of 1814===
On the night of December 12, 1814, more than 1000 British troops and 42 barges en route to New Orleans moved through the pass between Ship and Cat Islands and sailed westward along the Mississippi coast, passing just offshore of Pass Christian. They were closely watched by Lt. Thomas Ap Catesby Jones, commanding the seven American boats standing off Malheureux Island as the British proceeded to anchor off Henderson’s Point(western tip of Pass Christian) the night of the 13th of December. He dispatched the tender, Sea Horse, under the command of Sailing Master William Johnson into the Bay of Saint Louis to assist in the removal of the public stores lest they fall to the British. He then sent the ship, Alligator to Chalmette to warn General Andrew Jackson of the British approach.

Word of the British fleet’s arrival spread throughout the county and a large crowd gathered at sunrise on the 14th, along the bluff to watch the fleet passing. Three British boats were dispatched to capture the Sea Horse as it endeavored to load munitions below the bluff at Ulman Avenue. Among the crowd was an elderly lady on crutches, a Miss Claiborne, who was visiting from Natchez. About 2 p.m., on observing the impending attack, she is quoted as saying “Will no one fire a shot in defense of our country” whereupon it is said that she took Mayor Toulme’s cigar and lighted one of the cannon. The ball sailed past the Seahorse and landed close to the approaching British. Assuming that he had fire cover from shore, Capt. Johnson seized the initiative and attacked the British fleet. He had a 6-pounder (canon) on his deck and after half an hour of intense barrage the British retreated. Four more barges joined the first three and the seven renewed the attack. Although Capt. Johnson’s defense was gallant, superior numbers forced him to blow up the little schooner rather than surrender her.

The rest of the American fleet in the Mississippi Sound, consisting of four barges, was anchored in the westerly current between Malheureux Island and Point Clear. On the morning of the 15th, the British rowed their boats into the current until they were about two miles away where they anchored to take tea (breakfast) and rest before attacking. About 10:30 they closed on the brave little fleet under the command of Lt. Thomas Ap Catesby Jones.

By 12:40 the battle was over. Six Americans were dead and 35 were wounded. The British suffered 17 dead and 77 wounded.
The greater significance of this battle and the greater loss to the British was the passage of time allowing General Andrew Jackson to gather more troops and to complete fortifications for the defense at Chalmette where victory over the British was achieved on January 7.

The British were so certain of victory that they brought civil servants to assume governing the areas they expected to conquer with them, as well as wives and children who were waiting on the Mississippi Coast islands. However, the great victory for the Americans was rendered inconsequential because the peace treaty had already been signed and word had not reached the Coast.

Mississippi became a state in December, 1817 and the first act of the Mississippi legislature was to incorporate the city of Bay Saint Louis (directly across the bay from Pass Christian) to become the capital of the state. The incorporation was completed at the morning session but at the afternoon session, the representative from Rankin County changed his vote and Natchez was designated capital instead. It remained the capital for two years before the capital was moved to Jackson where it remains.

===Civil War ===
The town was a famous resort prior to the [[American Civil War]]. It was a favorite location for the beach and summer homes of the wealthy of [[New Orleans]], who built a row of historic mansions along the shoreline, where Scenic Drive was one of the country's notable historic districts.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} The Pass Christian Yacht Club, established in 1849, was the first [[yacht club]] in the South and the second in the United States.

During the Civil War, the Battle of Pass Christian occurred when the {{USS|Massachusetts|1860}} began shelling the town. The 3rd Mississippi Regiment, which was stationed in Pass Christian, had marched toward Biloxi expecting a [[Union Army|Union]] landing there, leaving Pass Christian completely unprotected. A housewife dashed to her upper floor balcony and waved a white bed sheet, the flag of surrender, and the bombardment ceased. Union soldiers plundered the town before withdrawing, there being little of value, including food, for them to confiscate. This skirmish became known as the Bedsheet Surrender.

=== Pass Christian flag ===
On September 4, 1861, 69 men, including Captain Ashbel Green were mustered into military service. They made up the [http://www.reocities.com/scvcamp373/CoH_3rd_MS_Inf_Reg_CSA.html Dahlgren Guards] Company, which was part of the Third Mississippi Infantry &quot;C&quot; Regiment, commanded by [http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=54567846 Col. John Deason]. The Pass Christian Dahlgren Guards was headed by [https://www.familysearch.org/learn/wiki/en/3rd_Regiment,_Mississippi_Infantry Lt. Col. Thomas A. Mellon] during their encampment at Camp Tugville, which was located two miles northeast of the Pass near the intersection of White Rock Road and Pass Road.

In the early months of 1862, the women of the Pass raised their spirits by creating a flag that represented their love for their men, devotion for their sovereign state, and dedication to the war effort. The flag they created, &quot;[http://city.passchristian.net/the_flag.htm The Pass Christian Flag]&quot; was an adaptation of the official flag of the Sovereign Republic of Mississippi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/us-mspch.html Pass Christian, Mississippi (U.S.)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Pass Christian is located at {{Coord|30|19|28|N|89|14|50|W|type:city}} (30.324463, -89.247214){{GR|1}}. According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|15.3|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|8.4|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|6.9|sqmi|km2}} (44.97%) is water.

[[Image:Mississippi-Coast-towns-NOAA.jpg|right|thumb|300px| '''Pass Christian, Mississippi''' (map center) is east of [[Bay St. Louis, MS|Bay St. Louis]], along the [[Gulf of Mexico]].]]
Geographically, the town of Pass Christian is [[peninsula]]r, with water on three sides: the Gulf of Mexico to the south, the Bay of St. Louis to the west and a long stretch of [[bayou]] to the north.
In 1781 all of Pass Christian peninsula was owned by Julia de la Brosse (Widow Asmard). Upon her death in 1799, Widow Asmard deeded 800 [[arpent]]s - the entire downtown Pass Christian - to Charles Asmar, who upon his death left the property to his heirs. Pass Christian was officially chartered as a town in 1848.&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.passchristian.net/pass_time_line.htm Pass Time Line&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pass Christian harbor===
[[Image:FEMA - 37538 - Pass Christian Harbor with docked boats in Mississippi.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Pass Christian Harbor]]
The Municipal Harbor was formalized in 1956 with the creation of a Harbor Commission. In 1958, an 11-foot high, 350-foot long, concrete, breakwater wall was constructed in the sound by the T.L. James Company.  There are only two such concrete harbor walls in the world, with the other in Japan. Almost 1000 linear feet of public fishing is permitted on the two breakwalls. The harbor consists of seven piers, four assigned for pleasure craft and three for commercial vessels. Before it was destroyed by waves from Hurricane Katrina there were 346 slips ranging in berth sizes from 31-feet to 84-feet, in addition to a skiff-pier providing 20 tie-ups. Water, electricity, showers, restrooms, and a bait and fuel station and a vessel pump-out station were available, all overseen from the two-story Harbor Master office.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pass_Christian,_Mississippi&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7 View source for Pass Christian, Mississippi - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

=== Oyster Reef ===
Pass Christian possesses some of the finest oyster reefs in the world and has served to anchor Pass Christian’s economy. The oyster reefs that lie just offshore are among the largest on the Mississippi Gulf Coast. The Pass Christian group of Oyster Reefs have been documented on maps since D'Iberville and Bienville chartered these waters in 1699. Early French maps of the area refer to the reefs and batures as Passe aux Huîtres (Oyster Pass). There are nine reefs comprising an area of about twenty square miles. Further west are the Henderson Point and Calico reefs which are one to two miles south of Henderson Point.

=== Pass Christian Yacht Club ===
The [http://www.pcyc-gya.org/ Pass Christian Yacht Club] is known as the birthplace of yachting in the South. The second oldest yacht club in the United States was organized in Pass Christian. The first deep sea rodeo on the gulf coast which included a tarpon category was at Pass Christian in 1925
Tarpon Hole, offshore of Pass Christian in the [[Mississippi Sound]], was the location where a world record Black Sea Bass was caught by Captain John T. McDonald. Captain McDonald operated the schooner ''Queen of the Fleet''. The fishing vessel was noted for its nearly spotless racing record throughout the 1890s and early 1900s until being replaced by larger, faster [[schooner]]s built for the Biloxi fisheries during [[World War I]]. The two-masted {{convert|42|ft|m|adj=on}} vessel was purchased in 1895 by Mrs. Bidwell, later given to John McDonald, and years later, was lost at sea on October 16, 1923, during a storm. John T. McDonald had been a city alderman in 1888, and served as mayor for three two-year terms from 1890 to 1895, and served another term in 1903. 
A descendant of CPT McDonald, William (Billy) McDonald, served as mayor from 1995 until July 1, 2006, when he had to resign due to health concerns.Before that, he served 12 years as a supervisor on the Harrison County Board of Supervisors and was responsible for many improvements to Pass Christian's infrastructure.

=== Sherman Castle ===
James M. Sherman, at age 67, began construction of Sherman Castle. Designed and built of solid cement, the steel-reinforced castle located at 1012 West Beach, Highway 90 has withstood many hurricanes. At the time of his death, Sherman had completed most of the structure with walls that are nine inches thick. Much of the structure was first laid out in molds that were shaped and poured with concrete to erect the castle piece by piece.

=== Hurricane Camille ===
Pass Christian was in the path of two of the most intense hurricanes ever to hit the United States--[[Hurricane Camille]] on August 17, 1969, and [[Hurricane Katrina]] on August 29, 2005. Each hurricane caused the near total destruction of the city.
Hurricane Camille, the 2nd strongest hurricane of the
20th century, was declared a hurricane (meaning it had
sustained wind speeds of 74 m.p.h.) on Friday, August
15, 1969. By the time it smashed into the Mississippi
Gulf Coast at Pass Christian, Mississippi 2 days later
on Sunday, August 17, it had sustained winds of 190
m.p.h. with gusts in the 210 – 220 m.p.h. range. It also
had the 2nd lowest barometric pressure ever recorded [909
millibars (26.85)]. Raindrops hit with the force of
bullets, and waves off the Gulf Coast crested between
twenty-two and twenty-eight feet above normal tide range.
Camille was only the 2nd hurricane on record to reach
Category 5 at the time of landfall, as well as being
the 2nd most intense hurricane at the time of landfall.
The 1935 Florida Keys Hurricane was the first Category
hurricane as well as the strongest hurricane to hit the
United States coastline this century.

[[Hurricane Camille]] destroyed the [http://wikimapia.org/9882567/Site-Richelieu-Manor-Apartments-Hurricane-Camille-1969 Richelieu Apartments] killing eight people who had chosen to ride the storm out. The Richelieu Apartments faced the Gulf of Mexico and was less than 250 feet away from the surf on the beach. Early Sunday, August 17, the storm was southeast of New Orleans by 200 miles, A Hurricane Warning was then announced for the entire Mississippi Coast.  Evacuation was advised but some of the occupants of the Richelieu apartments ignored the warning.  At 10:15 p.m. on August 17, 1969 the front wall of the storm came ashore. The Richelieu Apartments were totally destroyed; all that remained were the foundation and the shell of the in-ground swimming pool, the force of the water pounded the concrete block construction until it completely destroyed the building. The hurricane party depicted in [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071638/ &quot;Hurricane&quot;], a 74 min TV Movie featuring some notable stars includes actual footage of hurricane &quot;Camille&quot;

=== Hurricane Katrina ===
On August 29, 2005, Pass Christian was almost completely destroyed by Hurricane Katrina. Of the approximately 8,000 homes in Pass Christian, all but 500 were damaged or destroyed. In spite of the fact that the beachfront Scenic Drive follows the crest of a small bluff, affording it some elevation, most of the historic mansions along the road were severely damaged, and many were completely destroyed, including The superbly restored Greek Revival mansion &quot;Union Quarters&quot; described in the National Register of Historic Places as having been built in 1855. A cast iron fence fronted the property enclosing a Magnolia Historical Marker which was dedicated in 1960. It read, &quot;Union officers were temporarily quartered here during the invasion of Pass Christian.&quot;

Hurricane Katrina totally destroyed the local public library. It was rebuilt.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Hurricane Katrina Related Damages to Public Libraries in Mississippi&quot; (September 2005), Mississippi Library Commission, web:[http://www.ala.org/ala/cro/katrina/MSPL_Katrina_Damage.pdf ALA-Katrina]{{dead link|date=February 2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thirteen members of the city's police department retreated to the library after the police station became unsafe and water from the Gulf of Mexico began to pour in.

The library was immediately north of City Hall across a small parking lot but was at a lower elevation. When the water crested the elevation of City Hall, the police cars in the parking lot began to float and were carried around the parking lot by the current.  One car struck the south side doors, causing them to implode, and the Gulf of Mexico driven by Katrina's powerful winds rushed into the building.  With no way to fight against the current they were trapped inside a concrete box that was rapidly filling with water.  Knowing that they had to escape they attempted to shoot the glass out of the north side of the building. This was unsuccessful, as the bullets ricocheted off the glass. The [[laminated glass]] proved impervious to the .45 caliber rounds of the police-issue handguns. The force of the water entering the building after the southern wall was destroyed by the car was far too strong to swim against. The only way out was with the current.&lt;!---so what happened?---&gt;

The [[storm surge]] from Hurricane Katrina that hit Pass Christian was estimated at 8.5&amp;nbsp;m (27.8&amp;nbsp;ft),&lt;ref name=&quot;KatrinaTCR&quot;&gt;{{cite web| last=Knabb| first=Richard D| coauthors=Rhome, Jamie R.; Brown, Daniel P| url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pdf/TCR-AL122005_Katrina.pdf| format=PDF| title=Tropical Cyclone Report: Hurricane Katrina: 23–30 August 2005| publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]]| date=2005-12-20; updated 2006-08-10| accessdate=2008-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is the US record high,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=U.S. Storm Surge Records| url=http://www.wunderground.com/hurricane/surge_us_records.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt; leveling Pass Christian up to half a mile inland from the shore; estimation of highest storm surges was complicated because high-water markers were also destroyed. [[U.S. Route 90|Highway 90]] along the beach was damaged, and the bridge over the Bay of St. Louis was thrown completely apart, not being reopened until a new bridge was partially completed in May 2007. (Connection was temporarily replaced by a [[ferry]] service.) [[Sewage]] contamination rendered the local water supply unusable, as some samples tested positive for more than 250 bacteria and parasites. By late September 2005, access was restricted south of the railroad tracks (about four blocks inland) without proper credentials, as crews continued to search for victims and clear debris. In early 2007, although rebuilding was underway in much of the city, a large portion of empty, deserted homes and other structures remain. Many residents were still living in [[FEMA trailer]]s, and out-of-state volunteers were still needed for the rebuilding effort.

[http://www.public.navy.mil/necc/1ncd/Pages/NMCB1/default.aspx Naval Mobile Construction Battalion (NMCB) 1], based in Gulfport, Ms launched [http://www.seabee.navy.mil/ Seabees] from Construction Battalion Center (CBC) Gulfport Sept. 9 to neighboring communities throughout Harrison and Stone counties to include Pass Christian to assist its citizens with disaster recovery in the wake of Hurricane Katrina.In a measure to improve health, sanitation and morale, The Seabees cleared approximately three miles of railroad track for a temporary sewer line, they set up a laundry unit and installed a nine-head shower unit for the firefighters and volunteers.They also built tempoprary housing  to house 1,000 people rendered homeless by the impact of Hurricane Katrina. 250 Seabees from detachments across the United States have gathered behind the city's War Memorial Park, where they constructed a temporary police department headquarters and other municipal offices. This is not the first time that Seabees have answered the call to duty in Pass Christian. The naval construction teams performed a similar feat after Hurricane Camille struck the town hard in 1969.

{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2013}}

=== Manufacturing ===
The Du Pont White Pigment and Mineral Products Plant is located in DeLisle. The plant produces [[titanium dioxide]] and has been in operation since 1979. The town of Pass Christian is near the plant, directly across the Bay of St. Louis. Some community members also expressed concerns that chemical releases, as reported on [http://www.epa.gov/tri/ EPA’s Toxic Release Inventory], from the DuPont plant could have contaminated the community’s water and air. DuPont DeLisle’s titanium dioxide plant reported the third highest amount of dioxin-like compounds in EPA’s Toxic Release Inventory (TRI). In 2005, the Hurricane Katrina storm surge flooded significant portions of the plant. Unlike other aquatic organisms, blue crabs do not have the ability to metabolize quickly certain dioxin-like 
compounds [[Polychlorinated dibenzofurans]] that predominate in the coke and ore solids waste stream of the plant.

==== Seafood processing ====
The Pass Packing Company was formed on May 16, 1899, with George Brandt, F Andressen, Frank Sutter, TV Courtenay, JH Knost, and George H Taylor as its founding officers. This plant was bought out by the Dunbar and Dukate interests of Biloxi who also acquired the cannery at Bay St. Louis. The plant was located at the present site of the Pass Christian Yacht Club. Originally built in 1902, the building was destroyed by the 1947 hurricane. Workers arrived by truck or box car and were housed in special cottages owned by the factory. There was a large apartment building on Market Avenue which the locals called the &quot;White Elephant&quot;, and was reported to house as many as 30 families.  Additionally, there were the Row Houses consisting of rows of duplexes built one after the other.The &quot;Green Row&quot; on Dunbar Street had 16 duplexes, and the &quot;Red Row&quot; on Woodman Avenue had 19 duplexes.These houses were eventually abandoned when in 1956 mechanical oyster shuckers were installed, thereby eliminating the need for so many employees.

Besides seafood packer George Washington Dunbar, there was Ernest Hudson Merrick, who was one of the first importers of out of state labor for the seafood packing industry at Pass Christian. In 1908, he started visiting the Pass during summers to escape the heat of New Orleans.  During his summers he became interested in the potential of fishing along the coast and proceeded to build a fleet of fishing schooners and a factory for processing, packing, and shipping oysters and shrimp,”said one of his sons, Bill Merrick. He was one of the first to ship fresh oysters and shrimp to the north packed in ice.  The delicacy of the Gulf Coast oysters created a large demand in the Midwest.

Seafood production in the region has been severely impacted by large scale fish die-offs. The 2006 [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill|The Deepwater Horizon oil spill]] along with the presence of toxic sediments stirred up by Hurricane Katrina and record amounts of fresh water diverted into the Bonnet Carre Spillway in Louisiana has brought seafood production to a standstill.  Offshore Oyster Beds were hit especially hard.Field crews have reported a 50 percent to 65 percent mortality rate in some areas, and a 90 percent to 95 percent mortality rate in others. 
The owner of a Mississippi seafood company filed a federal class-action lawsuit Friday over the rig explosion that caused a massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico
On April 30, 2010 A local Seafood shipper, Jerry Forte, owner of Jerry Forte Seafood in Pass Christian, claims the spill could damage the commercial seafood industry. Forte's attorneys filed the suit in U.S. District Court in Gulfport.
The suit seeks at least $5 million in compensatory damages, plus an unspecified amount of punitive damages against Transocean, BP, Halliburton Energy Services Inc. and Cameron International Corp. and Hyundai Heavy Industries Co.

==Education==
The [[Pass Christian School District]] operates the schools in the city, and in the inland, unincorporated areas around and to the north of [[DeLisle, Mississippi|DeLisle]]. The Pass Christian Middle School (formerly the Pass Christian High School) on the corner of 2nd Street and Church Street was destroyed by Hurricane Katrina. A monument proclaiming that the school had withstood Hurricane Camille was left standing. The new Pass Christian High School, which opened in 2001, was flooded almost to the second level, but was renovated and re-opened in October 2006.  The Pass Christian Elementary School, across the street from the high school, was also flooded and was torn down because of mold concerns.  Delisle Elementary was the only school left standing, and became a temporary grounds for all of the students of the Pass Christian School District, housed either in temporary trailer classrooms or in the elementary school, sharing cafeteria and gymnasium facilities with the school.

A new educational complex housing Pass Christian Middle School and Pass Christian Elementary School is the $32 million Pass Christian Center of Excellence. It includes a day care center and an attached [[Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America|Boys &amp; Girls Club]],&lt;ref&gt;Samuels, Christina A. &quot;[http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2010/08/25/01gulf.h30.html Region's Schools Turn Storm's Havoc Into Transformation].&quot; ''[[EducationWeek]]''. August 25, 2010. Retrieved August 4, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; on the north side of campus. It opened in 2010.  As of 2011, Delisle Elementary School has been torn down and is under reconstruction.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Pass Christian High School is a [[Blue Ribbon school]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ORS&quot;&gt;[http://orshome.mde.k12.ms.us/ors/ Mississippi Assessment and Accountability Reporting System], Retrieved 2011-3-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The parochial elementary and middle school of St. Paul's Roman Catholic church was destroyed by Katrina, and the school was merged with the neighboring Long Beach parochial school to form St. Vincent de Paul School. Coast Episcopal High School is a parochial high school in Pass Christian.

Thompson was given an operating budget of $1.8 million and charged with hiring 25 sworn police officers and 10 to 15 civilian employees, finding and furnishing a police headquarters, and purchasing vehicles and equipment.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.clarionledger.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=20106130344&lt;/ref&gt;  Fire protection is currently provided by the Byram Volunteer Fire Department.In June 2011, Byram selected Mississippi State Fire Academy - Senior Instructor Marshall C. Robinson,Jr., as the city's first Fire Chief. Robinson was given a direction that included the transition from a 100% volunteer fire department to a combination fire department. Byram is currently moving to add fire service infrastructure designed to lower insurance rating in the whole city and create economic development designed to generate sustainable economic growth. {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

=== Re-incorporation ===
Since 1991, the bordering city of [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]] has been attempting to annex Byram. That led to unhappiness on the part of residents who feared higher property taxes and poor city services such as slow police response and a lack of street repairs.  Lawsuits between Jackson and local residents began in 2004.  After his election as mayor of Jackson, [[Frank Melton]] stated that he did not want to continue attempts at annexation, but the suit continued.

In 2006, a judge ruled that Byram could incorporate itself with about {{convert|20|sqmi|km2}}, and that Jackson could annex four square miles. The ruling was appealed to the Mississippi Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wlbt.com/global/story.asp?s=10121525&amp;ClientType=Printable |title=High court okays Byram incorporation |date=2009-04-02 |accessdate=2009-06-11 |publisher=[[WBLT]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 2, 2009, the Mississippi Supreme Court unanimously upheld the lower court's ruling. Jackson officials said they would ask for a rehearing. On April 17, 2009, the Mississippi Supreme Court granted an extension to attorneys for the city of Jackson to file a motion to reconsider the court's decision.  Ultimately, Byram incorporated on June 16, 2009.

==Education==

==History==
The site was first settled by John and William Lott in the early 19th century, giving the town its original name, Lott's Bluff.  It was incorporated as Columbia on June 25, 1819, becoming the fourth municipality in the state of [[Mississippi]].  It served as the temporary capital of Mississippi from November, 1821, when the 5th session of the Mississippi Legislature first met there, until 1822.  In that year, a special session of the legislature met in Columbia, inaugurating Governor [[Walter Leake]], and selecting LeFleur's Bluff (now [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]]) as the permanent capital.[http://www.mainstreetcolumbia.com]  Former Mississippi governor and Columbia native [[Hugh L. White]] introduced white squirrels to the area, and they are still common in Columbia City Park.[http://www.villageprofile.com/mississippi/marion/08/topic.html]

===Historic Home of Mississippi Rodeo===
In the mid-1930s, two Columbia, Mississippi [[cowboy]]s – [[Earl W. Bascom|Earl]] and Weldon [[Fort Bascom|Bascom]] – made Columbia the historic “Home of Mississippi Rodeo.” Known as the “Founding Fathers of Mississippi Rodeo,” the Bascom brothers pioneered the sport in Mississippi, producing the first [[rodeo]] in [[Marion County, Mississippi|Marion County]] in 1935. Originally from [[Alberta]], the Bascoms cowboyed for the nearby Hickman Ranch. Both of these cowboys married local girls. This first rodeo of 1935 was held at Columbia’s City Park and is now known in rodeo history as the world’s first outdoor night rodeo held under electric lights. In 1936, Earl Bascom, an inventor as well as a trained artist, designed and supervised the construction of Mississippi’s first permanent rodeo arena in Columbia. Earl Bascom has been called the “Father of Modern Rodeo”, having helped pioneer the sport with his many rodeo innovations. To this day, rodeo remains a popular sport in Columbia and Marion County.

'''Pearl''' is a city in [[Rankin County, Mississippi|Rankin County]], [[Mississippi]]. The population was 25,092 at the 2010 census. It is part of the [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]] [[Jackson, Mississippi metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]].

Today, Pearl is a growing community across the [[Pearl River (Mississippi-Louisiana)|Pearl River]], for which the city was named, from Jackson. It is Mississippi's 13th largest city and the largest city in Rankin County.

Pearl is a rarity in Mississippi cities in that it does not have a downtown square. Over the years the city has developed the old Pearl High School into a city administration building that houses city hall, Pearl Police Department, public works departments and city courts. A large auditorium-style community center was built next door.

==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2011}}
[[File:Pearl Mississippi becomes a city headline.JPG|thumb|left|The Rankin County Press headline from June 1973]]
The area was settled from the 1860s as a rural farming community close to the Pearl River. Population was sparse until the mid-1900s brought in people and industries from the state capital of [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]] in [[Hinds County]]. Thereafter, growth in the area came from the urban expansion of the capital, control of flood threats from the Pearl River, accessible interstates and [[Jackson-Evers International Airport]].

On September 16, 1968, a meeting was held to discuss the incorporation of Pearl, with all but 6 of the 657 attending residents favoring incorporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cityofpearl.com/history-of-pearl.php | title = History of Pearl | accessdate = 2009-06-06 | publisher=cityofpearl.com}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; A &quot;Boundary Committee&quot; proposed several different possible boundaries a little more than a month later, and the following January the community voted for a {{convert|11|sqmi|km2}} boundary that included the Pearl River to Airport Road, excluding East Jackson and all areas south of Interstate 20 except Cunningham Heights and Grandview Heights. A majority at that meeting also agreed on naming the city &quot;Pearl&quot;, in preference to the also-proposed &quot;Riverview&quot; and &quot;Brightsville&quot;, and named the first mayor, Harris Harvey, and council members Jimmy Joe Thompson, W.D. McAlpin, James Netherland, Ophelia Byrd, Mack C Atwood, W.L. Maddox and Bobby Joe Davis. With the Mississippi Supreme Court ruling of June 5, 1973, the incorporation could go ahead. A week later, the charter was issued, and on June 29, 1973 Governor William Winter presided over the first annual Pearl Day Celebration, with the swearing in of the city's new officials, who met for the first time on July 3, 1973.

*The Pearl Municipal Separate School District was created on May 18, 1976 by an Ordinance of the City of Pearl Mayor and Board of Alderman.
*The first franchise by the City of Pearl for [[cable television]] to be installed was granted on July 6, 1976.
*The Pearl Chamber of Commerce was formed on August 24, 1978.
*Pearl voters approved a $1.5&amp;nbsp;million bond issue to construct a new junior high school on December 1, 1981.
*The Rankin County campus of [[Hinds Community College]] opened in Pearl on July 1, 1983.
*A Community Center is next door to City Hall. Its clock tower includes inscriptions of the names of graduates of Pearl High School for the period 1949 through 1989 while the high school occupied this site.
*The [[Mississippi Braves]] baseball team play in Trustmark Park in Pearl.
*A {{convert|25000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} library opened near City Hall on July 18, 2005.

'''Yazoo City''' is a city in [[Yazoo County, Mississippi|Yazoo County]], [[Mississippi]]. It was named after the [[Yazoo River]], which, in turn was named by the French explorer [[Robert La Salle]]  in 1682 as &quot;Rivière des Yazous&quot; in reference to the [[Yazoo tribe]] living near the river's mouth. It is the county seat of Yazoo County and the principal city of the Yazoo City [[Micropolitan Statistical Area]], which is part of the larger [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]]&amp;ndash;Yazoo City [[Jackson-Yazoo City Combined Statistical Area|Combined Statistical Area]]. According to the 2010 census, the population was 11,403.

==Geography==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2012}}
Yazoo City is located at {{Coord|32|51|23|N|90|24|27|W|type:city}} (32.856458, -90.407379){{GR|1}}, 40 miles northwest of [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]] at the junctions of U.S. Routes [[U.S. Route 49|49]], [[U.S. Route 49|49E]], and [[U.S. Route 49|49W]], and MS Highways [[Mississippi Highway 3|3]], [[Mississippi Highway 16|16]], and [[Mississippi Highway 149|149]], on the banks of the [[Yazoo River]], near the [[Panther Swamp National Wildlife Refuge]].

[[U.S. Route 49W]] provides a fairly direct link between Yazoo City and [[Belzoni, Mississippi|Belzoni]]. The old highway segment has been renamed [[Mississippi Highway 149]]. MS 149 passes through [[Panther Swamp National Wildlife Refuge]] and the communities of [[Louise, Mississippi|Louise]] and [[Midnight, Mississippi|Midnight]] before reconnecting with the new US 49W at [[Silver City, Mississippi|Silver City]], seven miles south of Belzoni. The new highway makes the town of [[Carter, Mississippi|Carter]] so near that it might be considered for annexation by Yazoo City in a few years. There are now two bridges across the Yazoo River at Yazoo City.

The section of MS 3 in Yazoo City is called Haley Barbour Parkway. [[Haley Barbour|Barbour]], the former governor of Mississippi, grew up in Yazoo City and has a home on Wolf Lake, a lake north of Yazoo City. U.S. Route 49 (part of which was formerly U.S. 49E) through Yazoo City is named [[Jerry Clower]] Boulevard, after the famous comedian, a former resident of Yazoo City.

Yazoo City is also known as the &quot;Gateway to the Delta&quot; due to its location on the transition between the two great landforms that characterize the geography of Mississippi (the western part of the city lies in the [[Mississippi Delta]] and the eastern part lies in the loess bluffs that characterize most of eastern Mississippi). 
[[File:Ricks Memorial Library Yazoo.jpg|thumb|right|Ricks Memorial Library, Yazoo City]]
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|10.9|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|10.8|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|0.1|sqmi|km2}} (1.19%) is water.

==History==
[[File:Young band boy, and overseer. Yazoo City, Miss. - NARA - 523426.jpg|thumb|200px|Child Labor in Yazoo City (1911). Northern mills moved south to escape labor unions.]]
The community now known as Yazoo City was founded in 1824 with the name '''Hannan's Bluff'''. It was later renamed '''Manchester''', then changed to '''Yazoo City''' in 1841. Yazoo City became the county seat in 1849.

A [[yellow fever]] epidemic struck Yazoo City in 1853. During the [[American Civil War]], a makeshift shipyard was established on the Yazoo River at Yazoo City after the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] loss of [[New Orleans]]. The shipyard was destroyed by [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] forces in 1863, but the Confederates soon recovered Yazoo City. Union forces returned the following year and this time burned down almost the entire town. 

Yazoo City was rebuilt, but yellow fever struck and took more victims in 1878. In 1904 a fire destroyed much of central Yazoo City. According to a local legend, the fire was caused by a [http://www.yazoo.org/Wtchgrav.htm witch avenging her death.] In reality, a boy playing with matches accidentally set a house ablaze. The fire quickly spread and three-fourths of the town was destroyed, including most of the homes. It was stopped by a canal, which saved the new courthouse (built in 1872 to replace the one burned by the Yankees) and ten [[antebellum architecture|antebellum]] homes nearby. The town took almost two years to recover.

The [[Great Mississippi Flood of 1927]] did much damage to the entire Delta, but Yazoo City was restored and is now protected by an effective flood prevention system.

'''Natchez''' is the only city and [[county seat]]{{GR|6}} of [[Adams County, Mississippi|Adams County]], [[Mississippi]], [[United States]]. Natchez has a total population of 15,792 (as of the 2010 census).&lt;ref name=&quot;Census 2010&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_DP/G001/1600000US2850440| title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (G001): Natchez city, Mississippi| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau, American Factfinder| accessdate=June 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Located on the [[Mississippi River]] some {{convert|90|mi}} southwest of [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]], the [[State capital|capital]] of Mississippi, and {{convert|85|mi}} north of [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]], [[Louisiana]], it is the 25th-largest city in the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_DP/G001/0400000US28.16000| title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (G001): All places within Mississippi| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau, American Factfinder| accessdate=June 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is named for the [[Natchez people|Natchez tribe]] of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] who lived in the vicinity through the arrival of [[Europeans]] in the eighteenth century.

Established by [[French colonization of the Americas|French colonists]] in 1716, Natchez is one of the oldest and most important European settlements in the lower [[Mississippi River Valley]], and served as the capital of the [[Mississippi Territory]] and then the state of Mississippi. It predates Jackson, which replaced Natchez as the capital in 1822, by more than a century. The strategic location of Natchez, on a bluff overlooking the Mississippi River, ensured that it would become a pivotal center of trade, commerce, and the interchange of Native American, European, and African-American cultures in the region for the first two centuries of its existence. In U.S. history, it is recognized particularly for its role in the development of the [[Old Southwest]] during the first half of the nineteenth century. It was the southern terminus of the historic [[Natchez Trace]], which provided many pilots of [[flatboat]]s and [[keelboat]]s a road back to their homes in the [[Ohio River Valley]] after unloading their cargo in the city. Today Natchez serves in the same capacity for the modern [[Natchez Trace Parkway]], which commemorates this route.

In the middle of the nineteenth century, the city became the home of a collection of extremely wealthy Southern planters, who owned vast tracts of land in the surrounding lowlands of Mississippi and Louisiana where they grew large crops of [[cotton]] and [[sugar cane]] using [[slave labor]]. Natchez became the principal port from which these crops were exported, both upriver to Northern cities and downriver to [[New Orleans]], where much of the cargo was exported to Europe. The planters' fortunes allowed them to build huge mansions in Natchez before 1860, many of which survive to this day and form a major part of the city's architecture and identity. Agriculture remained the primary economic sustenance for the region until well into the twentieth century.

During the twentieth century the city's economy experienced a downturn, first due to the replacement of [[steamboat]] traffic on the Mississippi River by railroads in the early 1900s, and later due to the exodus of many local industries that had provided a large number of jobs in the area. Despite its status as a popular tourist destination for much of its preserved aspects of antebellum culture, Natchez has experienced a general decline in population since 1960. It remains the principal city of the Natchez, MS–[[Louisiana|LA]] [[Natchez micropolitan area|Micropolitan Statistical Area]].

[[File:Temple on Mound C and chiefs cabin de Batz.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Great Temple on Mound C and the Sun Chiefs cabin, drawn by Alexandre de Batz in the 1730s]]
According to [[archaeology|archaeological]] excavations, the area has been continuously inhabited by various cultures of [[indigenous peoples]] since the 8th century CE.{{Citation needed|reason=Apr 2010|date=April 2010}} The original site of Natchez was developed as a major village with ceremonial [[platform mound]]s, built by people of the prehistoric [[Plaquemine culture]], part of the [[Mississippian culture]]. Archaeological evidence shows they began construction of the three main mounds by 1200. Additional work was done in the mid-15th century.

By the late 17th and early 18th century, the [[Natchez people|Natchez]] (pronounced &quot;Nochi&quot;), descendants of the Plaquemine culture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| editor1-last=Rees| editor1-first=Mark A.| editor2-last=Livingood| editor2-first=Patrick C.| author1=Douglas C.

Weinstein| chapter=Extra regional contact and cultural interaction at the Coles Creek - Plaquemine transition: Recent data from the Lake Providence Mounds, East Carroll Parish, Louisiana| title=Plaquemine Archaeology| publisher=University of Alabama Press| year=2007| pages=38–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PLAQMISS&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.crt.state.la.us/archaeology/virtualbooks/LAPREHIS/plaqu.htm| title=Louisiana Prehistory: Plaquemine Mississippian| accessdate=2011-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; occupied the site, which they used for their major ceremonial center, replacing [[Emerald Mound]]. They added to the mounds, including a residence for their chief, the &quot;Great Sun&quot;, on Mound B, and a combined [[temple]] and [[charnel house]] for the elite on Mound C.  Many early European explorers, including [[Hernando de Soto]], [[René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle|La Salle]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville|Bienville]], made contact with the Natchez at this site, called the Grand Village of the Natchez. Their accounts provided descriptions of the society and village. The Natchez maintained a hierarchical society, divided into nobles and commoners, with people affiliated according to [[matrilineality|matrilineal]] descent. The [[paramount chief]], the &quot;Great Sun&quot;, owed his position to the rank of his mother.

The {{convert|128|acre|km2|adj=on}} site of the [[Grand Village of the Natchez]] is preserved as a [[National Historic Landmark]] and is maintained by the Mississippi Department of Archives and History. The site includes a museum with [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] from the mounds and village, picnic pavilion, and walking trails. Nearby Emerald Mound is also a National Historic Landmark.

===Colonial history (1716–1783)===
In 1716 the French founded [[Fort Rosalie]] to protect the [[trading post]] established in the Natchez territory in 1714. Permanent French settlements and plantations were subsequently established. The French inhabitants of the &quot;Natchez colony&quot; often came into conflict over land use and resources with the Natchez, who were increasingly split into pro-French and pro-English factions.

After several smaller wars, the Natchez (together with the [[Chickasaw]] and [[Yazoo tribe|Yazoo]]) launched a war to eliminate the French in November 1729. It became known by the Europeans as the &quot;Natchez War&quot;. The Indians destroyed the French colony at Natchez and other settlements in the area. In the [[Natchez Massacre]] on November 29, 1729, the Natchez Indians killed a total of 229 French colonists: 138 men, 35 women, and 56 children (the largest death toll by an Indian attack in Mississippi's history). Counterattacks by the French and their Indian allies over the next two years resulted in most of the Natchez Indians' being killed, enslaved, or forced to flee as [[refugee]]s. After surrender of the leader and several hundred Natchez in 1731, the French took their prisoners to New Orleans, where they were sold as slaves and shipped as laborers to the [[plantation]]s of [[Saint-Domingue]], as ordered by the French prime minister [[Jean-Frédéric Phélypeaux, Count of Maurepas|Maurepas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~msalhn/NativeAmerican/natchezmassacre.htm  Ginny Walker English, &quot;Natchez Massacre 1729&quot;], State Coordinator, Mississippi American Local History Network, 2000–2001, accessed 3 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the refugees who escaped enslavement ultimately became part of the [[Muscogee people|Creek]] and [[Cherokee]] nations. Descendants of the Natchez [[diaspora]] survive as the [[Natchez people|Natchez Nation]], a treaty tribe and confederate of the federally recognized [[Muscogee (Creek) Nation]], with a sovereign traditional government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://natcheznation.gq.nu/ Natchez Nation official web site]{{dead link|date = August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, Fort Rosalie and the surrounding town, which was renamed after the extinguished tribe, spent periods under [[United Kingdom|British]] and then [[Spain|Spanish]] colonial rule. After defeat in the [[American Revolutionary War]], the British ceded the territory to the United States under the terms of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]].

Spain was not a party to the treaty, and it was Spanish forces that had taken Natchez from the British. Although the Spanish were loosely allied with the American colonists, they were more interested in advancing their power at the expense of the British. Once the war was over, the Spanish were not inclined to give up that which they had taken by force. The Spanish retained control of Natchez for a time. A census of the Natchez district taken in 1784 counted 1,619 people, including 498 African-American slaves.

===Antebellum (1783–1860)===
[[Image:Historical house at Natchez - Mississippi.jpg|thumb|250px|right|&quot;The Parsonage&quot;, historic house in Natchez, Mississippi]]
In the late 18th century, Natchez was the starting point of the [[Natchez Trace]] overland route, a Native American trail originally established by migrating animals, most likely buffalo, which ran from Natchez to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] through what is now [[Mississippi]], [[Alabama]], and [[Tennessee]]. Produce and goods were transported on the Mississippi River by the [[flatboat]]men and [[keelboat]]men, who usually sold their wares at Natchez or New Orleans, including their boats (as lumber). They made the long trek back north overland on the Natchez Trace to their homes. The boatmen were locally called &quot;Kaintucks&quot; because they were usually from [[Kentucky]], although the entire Ohio River Valley was well represented among their numbers.

On October 27, 1795, the U.S. and Spanish signed the [[Pinckney's Treaty|Treaty of San Lorenzo]], settling their decade-long boundary dispute. All Spanish claims to Natchez were formally surrendered to the United States. More than two years passed before official orders reached the Spanish garrison there. It surrendered the fort and possession of Natchez to United States forces led by Captain Isaac Guion on March 30, 1798.

A week later, Natchez became the first capital of the new [[Mississippi Territory]], created by the [[John Adams|Adams]] administration. After it served for several years as the territorial capital, the territory built a new capital, named [[Washington, Mississippi|Washington]], {{convert|6|mi|0}} to the east, also in Adams County. After roughly 15 years, the legislature transferred the capital back to Natchez at the end of 1817, when the territory became a state. Later the capital was returned to Washington. As the state's population center shifted to the north and east as more settlers entered the area, the legislature voted to move the capital to the more centrally located city of [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]] in 1822.

Throughout the course of the early nineteenth century, Natchez was the center of economic activity for the young state. Its strategic location on the high bluffs on the eastern bank of the Mississippi River enabled it to develop into a bustling port. At Natchez, many local plantation owners had their cotton loaded onto steamboats at the landing known as Natchez-Under-the-Hill&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.underthehillsaloon.com/custom/webpage.cfm?content=News&amp;id=33]&lt;/ref&gt; to be transported downriver to New Orleans or, sometimes, upriver to [[St. Louis]] or [[Cincinnati]]. The cotton was sold and shipped to [[New England]] and European spinning mills.

The [[Natchez District]], along with the [[Sea Islands]] of [[South Carolina]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], pioneered cotton agriculture in the United States. Until new hybridized breeds of cotton were created in the early nineteenth century, it was unprofitable to grow cotton in the United States anywhere other than those latter two areas. Although South Carolina came to dominate the [[plantations in the American South|cotton plantation]] culture of much of the [[Antebellum South]], it was the Natchez District that first experimented with [[hybrid (biology)|hybridization]], making the cotton boom possible.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

The growth of the cotton industry attracted many new settlers to Mississippi, who competed with the [[Choctaw]] for their land. Despite land cessions, the settlers continued to encroach on Choctaw territory, leading to conflict. With the election of President [[Andrew Jackson]] in 1828, he pressed for Indian removal, gaining Congressional passage of an act authorizing that in 1830. Starting with the Choctaw, the government began Indian removal in 1831 to lands west of the Mississippi River. Nearly 15,000 Choctaw left their traditional homeland over the next two years.

On May 7, 1840, an intense tornado struck Natchez, killing 269 people, most of whom were on flatboats in the Mississippi River. The tornado killed 317 persons in all, making it the second-deadliest tornado in United States history. Today the event is called the &quot;[[Great Natchez Tornado]]&quot;.

The terrain around Natchez on the Mississippi side of the river is hilly. The city sits on a high bluff above the Mississippi River; to reach the riverbank, one must travel down a steep road to the landing called Silver Street, which is in marked contrast to the flat &quot;delta&quot; lowland found across the river surrounding the city of [[Vidalia, Louisiana]]. Its early planter elite built numerous [[antebellum architecture|antebellum]] mansions and estates. Many owned plantations in Louisiana but chose to locate their homes on the higher ground in Mississippi. Prior to the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Natchez had the most millionaires per capita of any city in the United States.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} It was frequented by notables such as [[Aaron Burr]], [[Henry Clay]], [[Andrew Jackson]], [[Zachary Taylor]], [[Ulysses S. Grant]], [[Jefferson Davis]], [[Winfield Scott]], and [[John James Audubon]]. Today the city boasts that it has more antebellum homes than any other city in the US, as during the Civil War Natchez was spared the destruction of many other [[Southern United States|Southern]] cities.

The Forks of the Road Market had the highest volume of slave sales in Natchez, and Natchez had the most active [[history of slavery|slave trading]] market in Mississippi. This also stimulated the city's wealth. The market, at the intersection of two streets, became especially important after the slave traders Isaac Franklin of Tennessee and John Armfield of [[Virginia]] purchased the land in 1823. Tens of thousands of slaves passed through the market, most originating in Virginia and the [[Upland South|Upper South]], and destined for the plantations in the [[Deep South]].  All trading at the market ceased by the summer of 1863, when [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] troops occupied Natchez.&lt;ref&gt;Jim Barnett and H. Clark Burkett, &quot;The Forks of the Road Slave Market at Natchez,&quot; ''Journal of Mississippi History,'' Sept 2001, Vol. 63 Issue 3, pp 168–187&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to 1845 and the founding of the Natchez Institute, the city's elite were the few who could pay for formal education. Although many of the parents had not had much schooling, they were anxious to provide their children with a prestigious education. Schools opened in the city as early as 1801, but many of the wealthiest families relied on private tutors or out-of-state institutions. The city founded the Natchez Institute to offer free education to the rest of the white residents of the city. Although children from a variety of economic backgrounds could obtain an education, class differences persisted among students, particularly in terms of school choice and social ties. Although it was considered illegal, slave children were often taught the alphabet and reading the Bible by their white playmates in private houses.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Huston Nguyen, &quot;The Value of Learning: Education and Class in Antebellum Natchez,&quot; ''Journal of Mississippi History,'' Sept 1999, Vol. 61 Issue 3, pp 237–263,&lt;/ref&gt;

===American Civil War (1861–1865)===
[[File:elder33.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[William Henry Elder]], Bishop of Natchez]]
During the Civil War, Natchez remained largely undamaged. The city surrendered to [[David Farragut|Flag-Officer David G. Farragut]] after the fall of New Orleans in May 1862.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = A. T. Mahan | title = The Navy in the Civil War | publisher = Sampson Low, Marston, and Company | place = London | year = 1898}}  [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/21562/21562-h/21562-h.htm#CHAPTER_II (available at gutenberg.org)]&lt;/ref&gt; Two civilians, an elderly man and an eight-year-old girl named Rosalie Beekman, were killed during the war, when a Union [[ironclad]] shelled the town from the river. The man died of a heart attack and Rosalie was killed by a shell fragment. [[Union Army|Union]] troops under [[Ulysses S. Grant]] occupied Natchez in 1863; Grant set up his temporary headquarters in the Natchez mansion [[Rosalie Mansion|Rosalie]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rosaliemansion.com/History.html &quot;A Brief History of Rosalie Mansion&quot;], official website&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Natchez residents remained defiant of the Federal authorities. In 1864, [[William Henry Elder]], the Catholic bishop of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Jackson|Diocese of Natchez]], refused to obey a federal order to compel his parishioners to pray for the [[President of the United States]]. The federals arrested Elder, jailed him briefly and banished him across the river to Confederate-held [[Vidalia, Louisiana|Vidalia]]. Elder was eventually allowed to return to Natchez and resume his clerical duties there, staying until 1880, when he was elevated to [[archbishop]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cincinnati|Cincinnati]].

Ellen Shields's memoir reveals a Southern woman's reactions to Yankee occupation of the city. Shields was a member of the local elite, and her memoir points to the upheaval of Southern society during the war. Because Southern men were absent at war, many elite women had to call on their class-based femininity and their sexuality to deal with the Yankees.&lt;ref&gt;Joyce L.. Broussard, &quot;Occupied Natchez, Elite Women, and the Feminization of the Civil War,&quot; ''Journal of Mississippi History,''  Summer 2008, Vol. 70 Issue 2, pp 179–208&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1860 there were 340 planters in the Natchez region who each owned 250 or more slaves; many were not enthusiastic Confederates. They were fairly recent arrivals to the South, opposed [[secession]], and held social and economic ties to the North. These elite planters lacked a strong emotional attachment to the South; but when war came, many of their sons and nephews joined the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate army]].&lt;ref&gt;William K. Scarborough, &quot;Not Quite Southern: The Precarious Allegiance of the Natchez Nabobs in the Sectional Crisis,&quot; ''Prologue,'' Winter 2004, Vol. 36 Issue 4, pp 20–29&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Dahlgren was among the recent migrants; from [[Philadelphia]], he had made his fortune before the war. He did support the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] and led a brigade, but was criticized for failing to defend the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]]. When the Yankees came, he moved to [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] for the duration. He returned in 1865 but never recouped his fortune. He had to declare bankruptcy, and in 1870 he gave up and moved to [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;Herschel Gower, ''Charles Dahlgren of Natchez: The Civil War and Dynastic Decline'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

White Natchez became much more pro-Confederate after the war. The [[Lost Cause of the Confederacy|Lost Cause]] myth arose as a means for coming to terms with the South's defeat. It quickly became a definitive ideology, strengthened by its celebratory activities, speeches, clubs, and statues. The major organizations dedicated to creating and maintaining the tradition were the [[United Daughters of the Confederacy]] and [[United Confederate Veterans]]. At Natchez and other cities, although the local newspapers and veterans played a role in the maintenance of the Lost Cause, elite women particularly were important, especially in establishing memorials, such as the Civil War Monument dedicated on [[Memorial Day]] 1890, and cemeteries. The Lost Cause enabled women noncombatants to lay a claim to the central event in their redefinition of Southern history.&lt;ref&gt;Melody Kubassek, &quot;Ask Us Not to Forget: The Lost Cause in Natchez, Mississippi,&quot; ''Southern Studies'', 1992, Vol. 3 Issue 3, pp 155–170&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postwar period (1865–1900)===
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2011}}
[[Image:Natchez MS bridge.jpg|thumb|left|[[Natchez–Vidalia Bridge]] over the [[Mississippi River]] near Natchez]]
Natchez was able to make a rapid economic comeback in the postwar years, with the resumption of much of the commercial shipping traffic on the Mississippi River. The [[cash crop]] was still cotton, but gang labor came to be largely replaced by [[sharecropping]]. In addition to cotton, the development of local industries such as logging added to the exports through the city's wharf. In return, Natchez saw an influx of manufactured goods from Northern markets such as [[Cincinnati]], [[Pittsburgh]], and St. Louis.

The city's prominent place in Mississippi River commerce during the nineteenth century was expressed by the naming of ''Natchez'' for nine steamboats plying the lower river between 1823 and 1918.  Many were built for and commanded by the famous Captain Thomas P. Leathers, whom [[Jefferson Davis]] had wanted to head the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] defense fleet on the Mississippi River. (This appointment never was concluded.) In 1885, the [[Anchor Line (riverboat company)|Anchor Line]], known for its luxury steamboats operating between St. Louis and New Orleans, launched its &quot;brag boat&quot;, the ''City of Natchez''. This ship survived only a year before succumbing to a fire at [[Cairo, Illinois]], on 28 December 1886. Since 1975, an excursion steamboat at New Orleans has borne the name ''Natchez''.

Such river commerce sustained the city's economic growth until just after the turn of the twentieth century, when steamboat traffic began to be replaced by the [[railroad]]s. The city's economy declined over the course of the century, as did that of many Mississippi river towns. [[Tourism]] has helped compensate for the decline.

After the war and during [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]], the world of [[domestic worker|domestic servants]] in Natchez changed somewhat in response to [[emancipation]] and freedom. After the Civil War, most domestic servants continued to be black women, and often they were single mothers. Although they were poorly paid, they found domestic work provided an important source of income for family maintenance. White employers often continued the [[paternalism]] that characterized relations between slaveholders and slaves. They often preferred black workers to white servants. White men and women who did work as domestics generally held positions such as gardener or governess, while black servants worked as cooks, maids, and laundresses.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Huston Nguyen, &quot;Laying the Foundations: Domestic Service in Natchez, 1862–1877,&quot; ''Journal of Mississippi History,'' March 2001, Vol. 63 Issue 1, pp 34–60&lt;/ref&gt;

===Since 1900===
For a short time, the women's school Stanton College in Natchez educated daughters of the white Southern elite. It was located in [[Stanton Hall]], built as a private mansion in 1858 and designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in the twentieth century. During the early 20th century, the college was a site of negotiation between the planter class and the new commercial elite, as well as between traditional parents and their more modern daughters. The young women joined social clubs and literary societies that maintained relations among cousins and family friends. The coursework included classes in proper behavior and letter writing, as well as skills that might enable those suffering from genteel poverty to make a living. The girls often balked at [[dress code]]s and rules, but also replicated their parents' social values.&lt;ref&gt;Cita Cook, &quot;The Modernized Elitism of Young Southern Ladies at Early Twentieth-Century Stanton College,&quot; ''Journal of Mississippi History,'' Sept 2000, Vol. 62 Issue 3, pp 199–223&lt;/ref&gt;

Located on the Mississippi River, the town long had an active nightlife. On April 23, 1940, 209 people died in a fire at the [[Rhythm Club fire|Rhythm Night Club]], a black dance hall in Natchez.&lt;ref name=hendrickson /&gt; The local paper remarked that &quot;203 negroes bought 50 cent tickets to eternity.&quot;&lt;ref name=hendrickson /&gt; This fire has been noted as the fourth deadliest fire in U.S. history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfpa.org/itemDetail.asp?categoryID=851&amp;itemID=21090&amp;URL=Research%20&amp;%20Reports/Fact%20sheets/Safety%20in%20other%20occupancies/Nightclubs/assembly%20occupancies/Public%20assembly%20and%20nightclub%20fires&amp;cookie%5Ftest=1 National Fire Protection Association.]&lt;/ref&gt; Several [[blues]] songs pay tribute to this tragedy and mention the city of Natchez.&lt;ref name=monge&gt;{{Cite news| title = Death by Fire: African American Music on the Natchez Rhythm Club Fire | author = Luigi Monge}} in {{cite book|author=Robert Springer|title=Nobody Knows Where the Blues Come from: Lyrics and History|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=sgwBhIm3sC4C&amp;pg=PR7|accessdate=1 September 2011|date=1 June 2007|publisher=Univ. Press of Mississippi|isbn=978-1-934110-29-4|pages=76ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil Rights Era and cold cases===
In the early 1960s, after the admission of [[James Meredith]] as the first black to the [[University of Mississippi]], Natchez was the center of [[Ku Klux Klan]] activity opposing [[racial integration|integration]] and the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–68)|civil rights movement]]. E. L. McDaniel, the [[Grand Dragon]] of the [[United Klans of America]], the largest Klan organization in 1965,&lt;ref name=&quot;UKARise&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.adl.org/issue_combating_hate/uka/rise.asp| title=Emergence of the UKA| publisher=[[Anti-Defamation League]]| year=2007| accessdate=2007-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; had his office in Natchez at 114 Main Street. In August 1964, McDaniel established a [[klavern]] of the UKA in Natchez, operating under the cover name of the Adams County Civic and Betterment Association.

Despite the violence of the time, Forrest A. Johnson, Sr., a well-respected white attorney in Natchez, began to speak out and write against the Klan.  From 1964 through 1965, he published an alternative newspaper called the ''Miss-Lou Observer'', in which he weekly took on the Klan. Klansmen and their supporters conducted an economic [[boycott]] against his law practice, nearly ruining him financially.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ladd&quot;&gt;[http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/index.php/site/comments/evolution_of_a_man_lifting_the_hood_in_south_mississippi/ Donna Ladd, &quot;Evolution of A Man: Lifting The Hood In South Mississippi&quot;], ''Jackson Free Press'', 26 October 2005, accessed 15 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In his October 1964 report, A.E. Hopkins, an investigator for the [[Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission]], who spied on activities of residents, wrote that the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) was in [[Adams County, Mississippi|Adams County]] in force &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;because of the alleged burning of several churches in that area as well as several bombings and the whipping of several Negroes; also, because of the murder of two Negroes from [[Meadville, Mississippi|Meadville]] whose bodies were recovered from the [[Mississippi river]] while the murders of three civil rights workers from Philadelphia was being investigated by Federal, State and local officials.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ladd&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; By that time, more than 100 FBI agents were in the area as part of the [[Philadelphia, Mississippi|Philadelphia]] investigation and to try to keep racial violence under control. Bill Williams, an FBI agent in Natchez for two years during that time, said in a 2005 interview that the &quot;race wars in the area are 'a story never told,' that Natchez in 1964 had become the 'focal point for racial, anti-civil rights activity for the state for the next several years'.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ladd&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Note: Hopkins was referring to the murders of the 19-year-old black men [[Henry Hezekiah Dee]] and [[Charles Eddie Moore]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965 two weeks after he urged the school board to accept desegregation, George Metcalfe, an [[NAACP]] official in Natchez, was seriously injured in the bombing of his car. On February 27, 1967, Wharlest Jackson Sr. was killed when a car bomb went off in his truck as he drove home from work at the Armstrong Rubber Company, where he had recently received a promotion and was working in a position previously &quot;reserved&quot; for whites. A [[Korean War]] veteran, married and with five children, he also had been treasurer of the NAACP. His murder was never solved, and no one has been charged in the crime.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ladd3&quot;&gt;[http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/index.php/site/comments/daddy_get_up_this_son_of_natchez_wants_justice_too/ Donna Ladd, &quot;Daddy, Get Up: This Son of Natchez Wants Justice, Too&quot;], ''Jackson Free Press'', 26 October 2005, accessed 16 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] published long lists of the names of Natchez residents who were current or former members of the Klan, including over 70 employees at the [[International Paper]] plant in the city, as well as members of the Natchez police department and the Adams County Sheriff's department.&lt;ref name=hendrickson&gt;{{cite book | last = Hendrickson | first = Paul | title = Sons of Mississippi | publisher = [[Alfred A. Knopf]] | year = 2003 | place = New York | isbn = 0-375-40461-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; HUAC found that there were at least four [[white supremacy|white supremacist]] terrorist groups operating in Natchez during the 1960s, including the Mississippi White Caps. The MWC distributed flyers anonymously around the city, threatening &quot;crooks and mongrelizers&quot;. The Americans for the Preservation of the White Race was founded in May 1963 by nine residents of Natchez.&lt;ref name=hendrickson /&gt;

The Cottonmouth Moccasin Gang was founded by Claude Fuller and Natchez Klansmen Ernest Avants and James Lloyd Jones. In June 1966, they murdered Natchez resident Ben Chester White, reportedly as part of a plot to draw Dr. [[Martin Luther King]] to Natchez in order to assassinate him. The three Klansmen were arrested and charged by the state with the murder, but in each case, despite overwhelming evidence and, in Jones's case, a confession, either the charges were dismissed or the defendants were acquitted by all-white juries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Ku Klux Klan in Mississippi: a History | last = Newton | first = Michael | year = 2010 | publisher = McFarland and Company | page = 171 | isbn = 978-0-7864-4653-7}}  [http://books.google.com/books?id=YSLCS7hg-DEC&amp; (available on Google books)]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Ford Seale]], arrested in 1964 as a suspect in the kidnapping and murders of Dee and Moore, had been released when the state district attorney decided not to take the case forward. Interest in the case was revived after 2000, and the FBI investigated. Seale was arrested and charged by the US Attorney. He was tried and convicted in federal court in 2007. He died in federal prison in 2011 at the age of 76.

The FBI discovered that Ben Chester White had been killed on federal land near Pretty Creek in the [[Homochitto National Forest]] of Natchez, which gave them jurisdiction. In 1999 they reopened an investigation into the case,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.natchezdemocrat.com/1999/12/05/white-was-an-unlikely-klan-target/ Kevin Cooper, &quot;White was an unlikely Klan target&quot;], ''Natchez Democrat'', 5 December 1999, accessed 16 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and indicted Ernest Avants in 2000. He was convicted in 2003 and sentenced to life in prison. He died in prison in 2004 at age 72.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nuweb9.neu.edu/civilrights/?page_id=768 &quot;Ben Chester White&quot;], Civil Rights and Restorative Justice, Northeastern University, 2011, accessed 16 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2011, ''The Injustice Files'' of the Investigation Discovery channel aired three TV episodes of cold case murders related to the civil rights era. The first episode was devoted to the story of Wharlest Jackson, Sr., killed in 1967, as noted above. This was part of a collaboration with the FBI, which had started an initiative in 2007 to investigate and prosecute civil rights cases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/16/arts/television/16civilrights.html Felicia R.

===Natural disasters===
In August 2005, in the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]], Natchez served as a refuge for coastal Mississippi and Louisiana residents, providing shelters, hotel rooms, rentals, [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] disbursements and animal shelters. Natchez was able to keep fuel supplies open for the duration of the disaster, provide essential power to the most affected areas, receive food deliveries, and maintain law and order while assisting visitors from other areas. Many churches, including Parkway Baptist Church, were used as emergency shelters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Crouch| first=Andy| title=It's Not About Power| url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2005/december/18.66.html| publisher=Christianity Today| accessdate=21 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the months after the hurricane, a majority of the available homes were purchased or rented, with some tenants making Natchez their permanent new home.

Flooding in 2011 drove the [[Mississippi River]] to crest at {{convert|61.9|ft}} on May 19, the highest recorded height of the river since the 1930s.

===Images and memory===
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2011}}
Historic wealthy and famous families in Natchez have used the Natchez Pilgrimage, which is an annual tour of the city's impressive antebellum mansions, to portray a nostalgic vision of its antebellum slaveholding society. Since the Civil Rights Movement, however, this version has been increasingly challenged by blacks who have sought to portray the black experience in Natchez.&lt;ref&gt;Jack E Davis, &quot;A Struggle for Public History: Black and White Claims to Natchez's Past,&quot; ''Public Historian,'' Jan 2000, Vol. 22 Issue 1, pp 45–63&lt;/ref&gt; According to the author Paul Hendrickson, &quot;Blacks are not a part of the Natchez Pilgrimage.&quot;&lt;ref name=hendrickson /&gt;

A [[cinema verité]] account of the 1966 Civil Rights actions by local NAACP leaders in Natchez was depicted by the filmmaker [[Ed Pincus]] in his film ''Black Natchez.'' The film highlights the attempt to organize a black community in the [[Deep South]] in 1965 during the heyday of the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. A black leader has been car-bombed and a struggle ensues in the black community for control. A group of black men organize a chapter of the Deacons for Defense—a secret armed self-defense group. The community splits between more conservative and activist elements.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.hamilton.edu/filmseries &quot;Ed Pincus’s Black Natchez (1967)&quot; ''F.I.L.M.'' 2010], Hamilton University Film Series&lt;/ref&gt;

By the winter of 1988 the National Park Service had established [[Natchez National Historical Park]] around [[Melrose (Natchez, Mississippi)|Melrose]] mansion. The William Johnson House in the city was added a few years later. The tours given by the National Park Service tend to present a more complex view of the past.

The historic district has been used by Hollywood as the backdrop for feature films set in the antebellum period. [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]'s ''[[The Adventures of Huck Finn (1993 film)|The Adventures of Huck Finn]]'' was partially filmed here in 1993. The 1982 [[television movie]] ''Rascals and Robbers: The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn'' was also filmed here. The television mini-series ''Beulah Land'' was also filmed in Natchez, as well a number of individual weekly shows of the TV drama ''The Mississippi'', starring [[Ralph Waite]].

In 2007 a [[United States Courthouse (Natchez, Mississippi)|United States Courthouse]] was opened, after renovating a historic hall for changed use. Part of the old hall had a [[Jim Crow]]-era monument to the local men and women from Natchez and Adams County who served in World War I. The 1924 monument was the subject of several stories in the ''Natchez Democrat'', as reporters noted it lacked representation of black Army troops who had served in the war. A story suggested the monument may be updated and the old monument retired.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.natchezdemocrat.com/2010/11/04/names-to-be-added-to-war-plaques/ &quot;Names to be added to war plaques&quot;], ''Natchez Democrat'', 4 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  On November 10, 2011, new plaques were installed which include the names of 592 African American soldiers along with 107 white soldiers, all of whom were not included on the old plaques.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.natchezdemocrat.com/2011/11/11/wwi-plaque-is-a-wrong-righted/], ''Natchez Democrat'', 11 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Itta Bena''' is a city in [[Leflore County, Mississippi]]. The population was 2,208 at the 2000 census. The town's name is derived from the [[Choctaw]] phrase ''iti bina'', meaning &quot;forest camp&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Native American place names in Mississippi | first = Keith A. | last = Baca | year = 2007 | publisher = University Press of Mississippi | isbn = 978-1-57806-954-5}} ([http://books.google.com/books?id=MgNgEVvsaZcC&amp;pg=PA45&amp; available at Google books])&lt;/ref&gt; Itta Bena is part of the [[Greenwood, Mississippi micropolitan area]].

==History==

===Early history of Itta Bena===
[[File:Roebuck Lake.jpg|thumb|left|Roebuck Lake in Itta Bena]]
[[File:Itta Bena MS WWI parade Love and Service for Our Boys float.jpg|thumb|right|WW I parade float]]
[[Choctaw|Choctaw Indians]] occupied the Delta region prior to the arrival of European settlers.  The first [[Indian removal|removal treaty]] carried out under the [[Indian Removal Act]] was the 1830 [[Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek]], which ceded about 11 million acres of the Choctaw Nation (now Mississippi) in exchange for about 15 million acres in Oklahoma.

[[Benjamin G. Humphreys|Benjamin Grubb Humphreys]], a state senator from [[Claiborne County, Mississippi]], is credited with the founding of Itta Bena.  Following several crop failures in the 1850’s at his ancestral home in Claiborne County, Humphreys took a trip by river steamer up into the Yazoo wilderness to look for a new farming opportunity in the former Choctaw area.

He found such an opportunity on Roebuck Lake, a stretch of old channel the river had discarded a few miles west of Greenwood, in the then [[Sunflower County, Mississippi|Sunflower County]]. Bringing a group of slaves up from his plantations during the winter, when boats could pass from the Yazoo into Roebuck, they began the long task of clearing farmland from the wilderness. Old Claiborne County friends became interested in the project, and the first of them began to acquire land in the area two years later.

Humphreys had established a permanent winter residence, &quot;Lucknow,&quot; in Claiborne County, and did not bring his family to the wilderness until he completed the building of a substantial home in 1857, christened &quot;Itta Bena,&quot; the Choctaw words for &quot;Home in the Woods.&quot; The walls of Itta Bena were made from logs felled in clearing the plantation, plastered and painted. It was the earliest substantial residence built in the wild Yazoo country and was the center of activity for the plantation’s many hundred acres. The main portion of the original Humphreys home was still in use as a residence in 1954 (thought to be the home of Dr. B. B. Harper on Lakefront Street).&lt;ref&gt;Frank E. Smith, The Yazoo, Rinehart &amp; Company, New York, 1954&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the Civil War, Humphreys became governor of Mississippi.

As other settlers moved into the area the village that grew up around the plantation was also called Itta Bena.  Other settlers moved into the area when the [[Columbus and Greenville Railway]] was begun in 1888.  Among the first to build stores were J. B. Humphreys, P. Cohen, and Uriah Ray.  The first store was operated by H. M. Weber and a man named Long.  The town’s first school, a one-room building, was built in 1888 and Miss Emma Cross served as the first teacher.&lt;ref&gt;James F. Brieger, Hometown Mississippi, 2nd Edition, copyright 1980, James F. Brieger&lt;/ref&gt;  The first high school was erected in 1905 across from the present-day First Baptist Church.  The post office in Itta Bena was opened in 1918.

==History==

McComb was founded in 1872 after Henry Simpson McComb of the New Orleans, Jackson and Great Northern Railroad, a predecessor of the [[Illinois Central Railroad]] (now part of the [[Canadian National Railway]]), decided to move the railroad's maintenance shops away from [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], outside of the attractions of that city's [[bar (establishment)|saloons]]. Main Street is one of the main streets in the downtown area with all the shops, attractions, and business. The railroad purchased land in Pike County, and three nearby communities, Elizabeth town, Burglund, and Harveytown, agreed to consolidate.

During the 1960s, McComb played a critical role in the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)|Civil Rights Movement]]. It was the location of [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee|SNCC]]'s first voter registration project which was met with violence and intimidation on the part of authorities and the [[Ku Klux Klan|KKK]]. More than 100 McComb high school students were arrested in 1961 for protesting the murder of voter-registration activist Herbert Lee and the expulsion of Brenda Travis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis61.htm#1961mccomb Civil Rights Movement Timeline 1961&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; McComb was the setting for several bombings involving racial strife.

==History==
The area that eventually became Belzoni was originally known as &quot;Greasy Row&quot; because of saloons along the bank of the Yazoo River.&lt;ref name=boh&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belzonims.com/belhistory.htm|title=History of Belzoni|publisher=Belzoni–Humphreys Development Foundation|accessdate=2010-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1895, a charter was granted for the village of Belzoni, although the area had been settled for several decades previously. Steve Castleman, who secured the charter, became the first mayor of Belzoni.&lt;ref name=boh /&gt; When Humphreys County was formed in 1918, Belzoni was selected county seat.&lt;ref name=boh /&gt;

Belzoni was the site of the murder of an early civil rights pioneer. The Rev. [[George W. Lee]], an African-American minister who was seeking voting rights for the disfranchised blacks of the [[Mississippi Delta]], was murdered in 1955 in &quot;Bloody Belzoni&quot; by racists committed to upholding segregation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Klopfer| first = Susan| authorlink = http://susanklopfer.com| title = Rev.

[[National Public Radio]] correspondent [[Margot Adler]], while an undergraduate at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], was active in the voter registration drive in Humphreys County (Belzoni) in the summer of 1965. In 2000, she recalled: &quot;I remember how difficult it was to register people: the fear was palpable. I remember that after one month of daily work there were only seven people registered, and a bunch of us almost got ourselves killed after being chased onto private property by a group of men who belonged to the [[White Citizens Council]]&quot;. She said that the civil rights movement changed Humphreys County, and bettered the lot of African Americans. &quot;There was real change in Belzoni. Streets were paved in hog town, sewers no longer overflowed into the dirt streets. Several black families I knew from then have held political office during the last decade&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Adler| first = Margot|work = Veterans of the Civil Rights Movement| title= Margot Adler|publisher = Westwind Writers Inc.| date =November 23, 2000| url = http://www.crmvet.org/vet/adler.htm| accessdate = 13 November 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091029090127/http://www.crmvet.org/vet/adler.htm| archivedate= 29 October 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jackson''' is the capital and largest city of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Mississippi]]. Located south of the [[Yazoo River]], it is considered to be at the southern border of the [[Mississippi Delta]].{{GR|6|dateform=mdy}} and is one of two [[county seat]]s of [[Hinds County, Mississippi|Hinds County]], with the city of [[Raymond, Mississippi|Raymond]] being the other.

The population of the city declined from 184,256 at the [[2000 United States Census|2000 census]] to 173,514 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. The 2010 census ascribed a population of 539,057 to the five-county [[Jackson, Mississippi metropolitan area|Jackson metropolitan area]].&lt;ref name=&quot;metrojacksoneda.com&quot;&gt;http://www.metrojacksoneda.com/demographics/JGA/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The current slogan for the city is &quot;Jackson, Mississippi: City with Soul.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jacksoncitywithsoul.com/ |title=Jackson, Mississippi &amp;#124; City With Soul |publisher=Jacksoncitywithsoul.com |accessdate=January 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson is ranked 3rd out of America's 100 largest metro areas for the best &quot;Bang For Your Buck&quot; city according to ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;''Forbes,'' December 2009 http://www.forbes.com/2009/11/30/cities-affordable-cheap-lifestyle-real-estate-housing-foreclosures_chart.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The study measured overall affordability, housing rates, and more. The city is named after [[Andrew Jackson]], who was a general at the time of the naming but later became president of the United States.  The city is the anchor of the Metro area.

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Jackson, Mississippi history}}
[[File:Choctaw-Nation.png|thumb|right|The entire [[Choctaw|Choctaw Nation]]'s location and size compared to the [[U.S. state]] of [[Mississippi]].]]

===Amerindians===
The region which is now the city of Jackson was historically part of the large territory occupied by the [[Choctaw]] Nation, the historic culture of the [[indigenous peoples]] who had inhabited the area for thousands of years before European encounter. The area now called Jackson was obtained by the United States under the terms of the [[Treaty of Doak's Stand]] in 1820, by which the Choctaw ceded some of their land. After the treaty was ratified, European-American settlers began to move into the area, so many that they encroached on remaining Choctaw land.

Under pressure from the U.S. government, the [[Choctaw]] Native Americans agreed to [[Indian removal|removal]] after 1830 from all their lands east of the [[Mississippi River]] under the terms of several [[List of Choctaw treaties|treaties]].&lt;ref name=&quot;website&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.meridianms.org/history.htm |title=History of Meridian, MS |accessdate=June 7, 2008 |publisher=Official website of Meridian, MeridianMS.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although most of the Choctaw moved to [[Indian Territory]] in present-day [[Oklahoma]], along with the other of the [[Five Civilized Tribes]], a significant number chose to stay in their homeland, citing Article XIV of the [[Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek]]. They gave up their tribal membership and became state and United States citizens at the time.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; 
Today, most Choctaw in Mississippi are part of the federally recognized [[Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians]] and live in several majority-[[Indian Reservation|Indian communities]] located throughout the state. The largest community is located in [[Choctaw, Neshoba County, Mississippi|Choctaw]] {{convert|100|mi|km|abbr=on}} northeast of Jackson.

===Founding and antebellum period (to 1860)===
[[File:Andrew Jackson.jpg|thumb|right|[[Andrew Jackson]], [[List of presidents of United States|7th President of the United States]] and the city's namesake]]The area that is now Jackson was initially referred to as Parkerville&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jacksonmississippi.worldweb.com/JacksonMS/FeaturesReviews/TownCityReviews//8-146541.html |title=WorldWeb.com Travel Guide |publisher=Jacksonmississippi.worldweb.com |accessdate=January 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was settled by Louis LeFleur, a [[French-Canadian|French Canadian]] trader, along the historic [[Natchez Trace]] trade route. The area then became known as [[LeFleur's Bluff]].&lt;ref name=&quot;jackhist&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jacksonms.gov/visitors/history |title=Official City of Jackson, Mississippi Website – Jackson's History |publisher=Jacksonms.gov |accessdate=January 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; LeFleur's Bluff was founded based on the need for a centrally located capital for the state of Mississippi. In 1821, the Mississippi General Assembly, meeting in the then-capital of [[Natchez, Mississippi|Natchez]], had sent [[Thomas Hinds]] (for whom [[Hinds County, Mississippi|Hinds County]] is named), James Patton, and William Lattimore to look for a site.  The absolute center of the state was a swamp, which forced the group to look close by for a new capital.

After [[surveying]] areas north and east of Jackson, they proceeded southwest along the [[Pearl River (Mississippi-Louisiana)|Pearl River]] until they reached LeFleur's Bluff in Hinds County.&lt;ref name=&quot;jackhist&quot;/&gt; Their report to the General Assembly stated that this location had beautiful and healthful surroundings, good water, abundant timber, navigable waters, and proximity to the trading route [[Natchez Trace]]. And so, a legislative [[Statute|Act]] passed by the Assembly on November 28, 1821, authorized the location to become the permanent seat of the government of the state of Mississippi.&lt;ref name=&quot;jackhist&quot;/&gt;  One Whig politician lamented the new capital as a &quot;serious violation of principle&quot; because it was not at the absolute center of the state.&lt;ref&gt;William C. Davis, ''A Way Through the Wilderness: The Natchez Trace and Civilization of the Southern Frontier'' (New York: Harper Collins, 1995), 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jackson was named for General [[Andrew Jackson]], in recognition of his victory in the [[Battle of New Orleans]] during the War of 1812. He was later elected as the seventh President of the United States, .

During the late 18th century and early 19th century, the area was traversed by the [[Natchez Trace]] and had a trading post. It connected the area to markets in Tennessee. A treaty with the Choctaw, the [[Treaty of Doak's Stand]] in 1820, formally opened the area for non-Native American settlers.

Jackson was originally planned, in April 1822, by [[Peter Van Dorn]] in a &quot;[[checkerboard]]&quot; pattern advocated by [[Thomas Jefferson]], in which [[city blocks]] alternated with parks and other open spaces. Over time, many of the park squares have been developed.

The state [[legislature]] first met in Jackson on December 23, 1822.

In 1839, Jackson was the site of the passage of the first state law that permitted married women to own and administer their own property.

Jackson was first linked with other cities by [[railroad|rail]] in 1840. An 1844 map shows Jackson linked by an east-west rail line running between [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]], Raymond, and [[Brandon, Mississippi|Brandon]]. Unlike Vicksburg, [[Greenville, Mississippi|Greenville]], and [[Natchez, Mississippi|Natchez]], Jackson is not located on the [[Mississippi River]], and did not develop like those cities from that river commerce. Instead, construction of railroad lines to the city sparked growth in the decades after the [[American Civil War]].

===American Civil War and late nineteenth century (1861–1900)===
[[File:Jackson-StarsAndStripesHarpers.jpg|thumb|1000px|left|&quot;Raising the Stars and Stripes Over the Capitol of the State of Mississippi,&quot; engraving from ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'', 20 June 1863, after the capture of Jackson by Union forces during the American Civil War.]]

[[File:Jacksonsiege1863.jpg|right|thumb|September 1863 map of the Siege of Jackson.]]Despite its small population, during the Civil War, Jackson became a strategic center of manufacturing for the Confederate States of America. In 1863, during the [[Military campaign|campaign]] which ended in the capture of [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]], [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] forces captured Jackson during two battles—once before the fall of Vicksburg and once after the fall of Vicksburg.

On May 13, 1863, Union forces won the first [[Battle of Jackson, Mississippi|Battle of Jackson]], forcing [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] forces to flee northward towards [[Canton, Mississippi|Canton]]. On May 15, Union [[troops]] under the [[command (military formation)|command]] of [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] burned and looted key facilities in Jackson, a strategic manufacturing and railroad center for the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]].  After driving the Confederate forces out of Jackson, Union forces turned west and engaged the Vicksburg defenders at the [[Battle of Champion Hill]] in nearby [[Edwards, Mississippi|Edwards]].  The siege of Vicksburg began soon after the Union victory at Champion Hill.  Confederate forces began to reassemble in Jackson in preparation for an attempt to break through the Union lines surrounding Vicksburg and end the [[siege]] there.  The Confederate forces in Jackson built defensive [[fortification]]s encircling the city while preparing to march west to Vicksburg.

Confederate forces marched out of Jackson to break the siege of Vicksburg in early July 1863.  However, unknown to them, Vicksburg had already surrendered on July 4, 1863.  General [[Ulysses S. Grant]] dispatched General Sherman to meet the Confederate forces heading west from Jackson.  Upon learning that Vicksburg had already surrendered, the Confederates retreated back into Jackson, thus beginning the [[Siege of Jackson]], which lasted for approximately one week.  Union forces encircled the city and began an [[artillery]] [[bombardment]].  One of the Union artillery emplacements still remains intact on the grounds of the [[University of Mississippi Medical Center]] in Jackson. Another Federal position is still intact on the campus of [[Millsaps College]].  One of the Confederate Generals defending Jackson was former United States [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[John C. Breckenridge]].  On July 16, 1863, Confederate forces slipped out of Jackson during the night and retreated across the Pearl River.  Union forces completely burned the city after its capture this second time, and the city earned the nickname &quot;Chimneyville&quot; because only the [[chimney]]s of houses were left standing. The northern line of Confederate defenses in Jackson during the siege was located along a road near downtown Jackson, now known as [[Fortification Street]].

[[File:Mississippi Old Capitol.jpg|thumb|right|Mississippi Old Capitol, downtown Jackson.]]
Today few [[Antebellum architecture|antebellum]] structures remain standing in Jackson. One surviving structure is the [[Mississippi Governor's Mansion|Governor's Mansion]], built in 1842, which served as Sherman's headquarters. Another is the [[Old Mississippi State Capitol|Old Capitol]] building, which served as the home of the Mississippi state legislature from 1839 to 1903. The Mississippi legislature passed the ordinance of [[secede|secession]] from the Union on January 9, 1861 there, becoming the second state to secede from the United States.

During Reconstruction, Mississippi had considerable insurgent action, as whites struggled to maintain supremacy. In 1875 the [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]] were formed, one of a second wave of [[insurgent]] [[paramilitary organizations]] that essentially operated as &quot;the military arm of the Democratic Party&quot; to take back political power from the Republicans and to drive blacks from the polls.&lt;ref&gt;George C. Rable, ''But There Was No Peace: The Role of Violence in the Politics of Reconstruction'', Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1984, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; Democrats regained control of the state legislature in 1876. The constitutional convention of 1890, which produced [[Mississippi's Constitution of 1890]], was also held at the capitol.

This was the first of new constitutions or amendments ratified in southern states through 1908 that effectively [[disfranchisement after the Civil War|disfranchised]] African Americans and poor whites, through provisions making voter registration more difficult: such as [[poll taxes]], residency requirements, and [[literacy tests]]. These provisions survived a Supreme Court challenge in 1898.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=224731 Richard H. Pildes, &quot;Democracy, Anti-Democracy, and the Canon&quot;, ''Constitutional Commentary'', Vol.17, 2000, pp.12–13]. Retrieved March 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Perman, ''Struggle for Mastery: Disfranchisement in the South, 1888–1908'', Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;  As 20th-century Supreme Court decisions began to find such provisions unconstitutional, Mississippi and other southern states rapidly devised new methods to continue disfranchisement of most blacks.

The economic recovery from the Civil War was slow through the start of the 20th century, but there were some developments in transportation.  In 1871, the city introduced mule-drawn streetcars which ran on State Street, which were replaced by electric ones in 1899.&lt;ref&gt;Todd Sanders, ''Images of America: Jackson’s North State Street'' (Charleston: Arcadia Publishing, 2009), 58 and 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

The so-called [[Mississippi State Capitol|New Capitol]] replaced the older structure upon its completion in 1903. Today the Old Capitol is operated as a historical museum. A third important surviving antebellum structure is the [[Jackson City Hall]], built in 1846 for less than $8,000. It is said that Sherman, a [[Freemasonry|Mason]], spared it because it housed a [[Masonic Lodge]], though a more likely reason is that it housed an army hospital.

===Early twentieth century (1901–1960)===
[[File:Jackson Mississippi Panorama 1910.jpg|thumb|1000px|left|Panorama of downtown Jackson in 1910. The Old Capitol and Capitol Street can be seen at the center of the photo. The New Capitol is at the left.]]

[[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning author [[Eudora Welty]] was born in Jackson in 1909, lived most of her life in the Belhaven section of the city, and died there in 2001.  Her [[memoir]] of development as a writer, ''[[One Writer's Beginnings]]'' (1984), presented a picture of the city in the early twentieth century. The main Jackson [[Public Library]] was named in her honor.

[[File:Standard Life Building.jpg|thumb|Standard Life Building, downtown Jackson.]]
The highly acclaimed African-American author [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]] lived in Jackson as an adolescent and young man in the 1910s and 1920s.  He related his experience in his memoir ''[[Black Boy]]'' (1945). He described the harsh and largely terror-filled life most African Americans experienced in the South and northern ghettos under [[Racial segregation|segregation]] in the early twentieth century.

[[File:TownCreekMississippi1921.jpg|thumb|left|April 16, 1921 flood on [[Town Creek (Mississippi)|Town Creek]] tributary stream at Jackson, Mississippi shown flowed onto Capitol Street. The photo is a view of East Capitol Street looking east from North Farish Street.]]Jackson saw significant growth in the early twentieth century, as reflected in changes in the city's skyline. Jackson's new Union Station downtown reflected the city's service by multiple rail lines, including the Illinois Central. Across the street, the new, luxurious King Edward Hotel, long the center of Jackson society and Mississippi politics, opened its doors in 1923, having been built according to a design by New Orleans architect William T. Nolan. Nearby, the 18-story Standard Life Building, designed in 1929 by Claude Lindsley, became the largest reinforced concrete structure in the world upon its completion. Jackson's economic growth was further stimulated in the 1930s by the discovery of natural gas fields nearby.

Speculators began searching for oil and natural gas in Jackson beginning in 1920.  The initial drilling attempts of the early twenties came up empty.  This initial failure did not stop Ella Render from obtaining a lease from the state’s insane asylum to begin a well in 1924.  Render found natural gas, but eventually lost the rights when courts determined that the asylum did not have the right to lease the state’s property.  Businessmen jumped on the opportunity and dug wells in the Jackson area.  The continued success of these ventures attracted further investment and by 1930, there were fourteen derricks in the Jackson skyline.  Governor Theodore Bilbo stated “it is no idle dream to prophecy that the state’s share [of the oil and natural gas profits] properly safe-guarded would soon pay the state’s entire bonded indebtedness and even be great enough to defray all the state’s expenses and make our state tax free so long as obligations are concerned.”  This enthusiasm was subdued when the first well’s failed to produce oil of a sufficiently high gravity for commercial success.  The barrels of oil had considerable amounts of salt water which lessened the quality.  However, all was not lost.  The governor’s prediction is wrong in hindsight, but the oil and natural gas industry was a tremendous business for the city and state.  The effects of the Great Depression were mollified by the industry’s success.  At its height in 1934, there were one hundred and thirteen producing wells in the state.  The overwhelming majority were closed by 1955.&lt;ref&gt;Dudley J. Hughes, Oil in the Deep South: A History of the Oil Business in Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida, 1859–1945 (Jackson: University of Mississippi Press, 1993), 67–86.&lt;/ref&gt;

During World War II, [[Hawkins Field (airport)|Hawkins Field]] in northwest Jackson became a major airbase. Among other facilities and units, the Royal Netherlands Military Flying School was established there, after Nazi Germany occupied the Netherlands. From 1941, the base trained all Dutch military aircrews.

In 1949, the poet Margaret Walker began teaching at Jackson State University, a historically black college. She would teach there until 1979, founding the Center for African-American Studies. Her collection won a Yale Younger Poets Prize and her second novel, ''[[Jubilee (novel)|Jubilee]]'' (1966), is considered a major work of African-American literature. She influenced many younger writers.

===Civil Rights Movement in Jackson===
Since 1960, Jackson has undergone a series of dramatic changes and growth. In 1960, the Census Bureau reported Jackson's population as 64.3% white and 35.7% black.&lt;ref name=&quot;census1&quot; /&gt; As the state capital, it became a site for [[civil rights]] activism that was heightened by mass demonstrations during the 1960s.  On May 24, 1961, during the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–1968)|African-American Civil Rights Movement]], more than 300 [[Freedom Riders]] were arrested in Jackson for [[disturbing the peace (crime)|disturbing the peace]] after they disembarked from their bus.  They were riding the bus to demonstrate against segregation on public transportation, as the Constitution provided for unrestricted public transportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
  | last = Civil Rights Movement Veterans

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Freedom Riders had intended [[New Orleans, Louisiana]] as their final destination, Jackson was the farthest that any of them managed to travel.

Efforts to desegregate Jackson facilities began before the Freedom Rides when nine [[Tougaloo College|Tougaloo]] students were arrested for attempting to read books in the &quot;white only&quot; public library. Founded as a [[historically black college]] (HBCU) by the [[American Missionary Movement]] after the Civil War, Tougaloo College brought both black and white students together to work for civil rights. It also created partnerships with neighboring mostly white [[Millsaps College]] to work with student activists. It has been recognized as a site on the Civil Rights Trail by the [[National Park Service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In Jackson, shortly after midnight on June 12, 1963, [[Medgar Evers]], civil rights [[activism|activist]] and leader of the Mississippi [[chapter (religion)|chapter]] of the [[NAACP]], was murdered by [[Byron De La Beckwith]], a [[white supremacist]]. Thousands marched in his funeral procession to protest the killing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis63.htm#1963medgar  Medgar Evers Assassination] ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, [[prosecutor]]s Ed Peters and [[Bobby DeLaughter]] finally obtained a murder [[convict]]ion of De La Beckwith.  A portion of [[U.S. Highway 49]], all of Delta Drive, a library, the central post office for the city, and [[Jackson-Evers International Airport]] were named in honor of Medgar Evers. During 1963 and 1964, organizers gathered local residents for voter education and voter registration. In a pilot project, they rapidly registered 80,000 voters across the state, demonstrating the desire of African Americans to vote. In 1964 they created the [[Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party]] as an alternative to the all-white state Democratic Party, and sent an alternate slate of candidates to the national party convention.

Segregation and the disfranchisement of African Americans gradually ended after the Civil Rights Movement gained passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and [[Voting Rights Act]] of 1965. In June 1966, Jackson was also the terminus of the James Meredith March, organized by [[James Meredith]], the first [[African American]] to enroll at the [[University of Mississippi]]. The march, which began in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], was an attempt to garner support for implementation of civil rights legislation. It was accompanied by a new drive to register African Americans to vote in Mississippi. In this latter goal, it succeeded in registering between 2,500 and 3,000 black Mississippians to vote. The march ended on June 26 after Meredith, who had been wounded by a sniper's bullet earlier on the march, addressed a large rally of some 15,000 people in Jackson.

White riots followed the enrollment of Meredith at the University of Mississippi, and residents took down street signs to hinder the travel of US Army forces. US Marshals held back rioters during the night at the University, and the city of Jackson was placed under martial law by the Army for a one-year period by order of Congress and President [[John F. Kennedy]].

In September 1967 the [[Ku Klux Klan]] bombed the synagogue building of the [[Beth Israel Congregation (Jackson, Mississippi)|Beth Israel Congregation]] in Jackson, and in November bombed the house of its [[rabbi]], Dr. [[Perry Nussbaum]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BethIsrael&quot; &gt;[http://www.isjl.org/history/archive/ms/historyofbethisraeljackson.htm  History of Beth Israel, Jackson, Mississippi], Goldring/Woldenberg Institute of Southern Jewish Life website, History Department, Digital Archive, Mississippi, Jackson, Beth Israel. Retrieved August 17, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gradually the old barriers came down. Since then, both whites and African Americans in the state have had a high rate of voter registration and turnout.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aei.org/publications/pubID.24237/pub_detail.asp  Edward Blum and Abigail Thernstrom, Executive Summary of the ''Bullock-Gaddie Expert Report on Mississippi,'' Apr 17, 2006], American Enterprise Institute, Retrieved March 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent history===
The first successful cadaveric [[human lung|lung]] [[Organ transplant|transplant]] was performed at the [[University of Mississippi Medical Center]] in Jackson in June 1963 by Dr. [[James Hardy (surgeon)|James Hardy]]. Hardy transplanted the cadaveric lung into a patient suffering from lung cancer. The patient survived for eighteen days before dying of [[kidney failure]].

Since 1968, Jackson has been the home of [[Malaco Records]], one of the leading [[record company|record companies]] for [[gospel music|gospel]], blues and [[soul music]] in the United States. In January 1973, [[Paul Simon]] recorded the songs &quot;Learn How To Fall&quot; and &quot;Take Me To the Mardi Gras&quot;, found on the album ''[[There Goes Rhymin' Simon]]'', in Jackson at the Malaco Recording Studios.  Many well-known Southern artists recorded on the album including the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section (David Hood, Jimmy Johnson, Roger Hawkins, Barry Beckett), Carson Whitsett, the Onward Brass Band from New Orleans, and others. The label has recorded many leading soul and blues artists including Bobby Bland, ZZ Hill, Latimore, Shirley Brown, Denise LaSalle and Tyrone Davis.

On May 15, 1970 [[Jackson Police Department (Mississippi)|police]] killed two students and wounded 12 at [[Jackson State University]] (then called Jackson State College) after a protest of the [[Vietnam War]] included students' overturning and burning some cars. These killings occurred eleven days after the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] killed four students in an anti-war protest at [[Kent State University]] in [[Ohio]], and were part of national social unrest.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Spofford, ''Lynch Street: The May 1970 Slayings at Jackson State College, Kent, OH: Kent State University Press, 1988, pp. 17 and 19&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Newsweek]]'' cited the Jackson State killings in its issue of May 18 when it suggested that U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]] faced a new [[home front]].

In 1997, [[Harvey Johnson, Jr.]] was elected as the city's first African-American mayor.  During his term, he proposed the creation of a [[convention center]], to attract more business to the city.  In 2004, during his second term, 66 percent of the voters passed a referendum for a tax to build the Convention Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitjackson.com/media-article.php?article_id=52 |title=Jackson Mississippi Tourism- City of Jackson Travel, MS Vacations, Event Planning |publisher=Visitjackson.com |accessdate=January 31, 2010}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mayor Johnson was replaced by [[Frank Melton]] on July 4, 2005. Melton subsequently generated controversy through his unconventional behavior, which included acting as a law enforcement officer.  A dramatic spike in crime also ensued, despite Melton's efforts to reduce crime.  The lack of jobs contributed to crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

2007 saw a historic first for Mississippi as [[Hinds County, Mississippi|Hinds County]] sheriff Malcolm McMillin was appointed as the new police chief in Jackson. McMillin was both the county sheriff and city police chief until 2009 when he stepped down due to the disagreements with the previous mayor.

On March 18, 2013, a severe hailstorm hit the Jackson metro area. The hail caused major damage to roofs, vehicles,and siding damage to multiple mobile homes in the Jackson metro. The size of the hail ranged from golfball-sized to baseball-sized. There were over 40,000 hailstorm claims of homeowner &amp; automobile damage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.srh.noaa.gov/jan/?n=2013_03_18_severe/ March 18, 2013: Severe Weather Event]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://msbusiness.com/blog/2013/04/03/insurers-see-more-than-40000-hailstorm-claims-chaney-expects-more/ Insurers see more than 40,000 hailstorm claims]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Jackson was named one of the top 10 ''friendliest'' cities in the United States. The capital city was tied with [[Natchez, Mississippi|Natchez]] with a number 7. The city was noticed for ''friendly people'', ''great food'' &amp; ''green and pretty'' public places.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cntraveler.com/daily-traveler/2013/07/travel-us-cities-charleston-newark-branson-friendly-unfriendly_slideshow_item4_5 &quot;The Friendliest and Unfriendliest Cities in the U.S.&quot;], CN Traveler&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
[[File:Jackson Mississippi.jpg|thumb|left|Photograph of Jackson Mississippi taken from the International Space Station (ISS)]]
Jackson is located on the [[Pearl River (Mississippi-Louisiana)|Pearl River]], and is served by the [[Ross Barnett Reservoir]], which forms a section of the Pearl River and is located northeast of Jackson on the border between [[Madison County, Mississippi|Madison]] and [[Rankin County, Mississippi|Rankin]] counties. A tiny portion of the city containing [[Tougaloo College]] lies in Madison County, bounded on the west by [[Interstate 220 (Mississippi)|I-220]] and on the east by [[U.S. Route 51|US 51]] and [[Interstate 55|I-55]]. A second portion of the city is located in Rankin County. In the 2000 census, 683,723 of the city's 684,256 residents (99.7%) lived in Hinds County and 1,533 (0.3%) in Madison County. Although no Jackson residents lived in the Rankin County portion in 2000, that figure had risen to 172 by 2006.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|106.8|sqmi}}, of which, {{convert|104.9|sqmi}} is land, and {{convert|1.9|sqmi}}, or 1.80% of the total, is water.

===Climate===
Jackson is located in the [[humid subtropical climate]] zone ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfa''), with hot, humid summers and mild winters. Rain occurs throughout the year, though the winter and spring are the wettest seasons, and the late summer and early autumn is usually the driest time of the year. Snow is rare, and accumulation very seldom lasts more than a day.&lt;ref name = NCDC /&gt; Much of Jackson's rainfall occurs during thunderstorms. Thunder is heard on roughly 70 days each year. Jackson lies in a region prone to [[severe thunderstorm]]s which can produce large [[hail]], damaging winds and [[tornado]]es. Among the most notable tornado events was the F5 [[Candlestick Park Tornado]] on March 3, 1966 which destroyed the shopping center of the same name and surrounding businesses and residential areas, killing 19 in South Jackson.

The record low temperature is {{convert|−5|°F|0}}, set on January 27, 1940,&lt;ref name = NOAA&gt;[http://www.nws.noaa.gov/climate/xmacis.php?wfo=jan]&lt;/ref&gt; and the record high is {{convert|107|°F|0}}, recorded as recently as August 30, 2000.&lt;ref name = NOAA/&gt;

The bulk of the city is to the west of I-55,  while a section of Jackson known as Northeast Jackson is to the east of I-55. In recent years there has been an effort to revitalize downtown Jackson, west Jackson communities, and south Jackson communities. Over 2&amp;nbsp;billion dollars of revitalization and development has been poured into the city from private redevelopment groups and federal and local funding.

Jackson remained a small town for much of the 19th century. Before the American Civil War, Jackson's population remained small, particularly in contrast to those towns located along the commerce-laden Mississippi River. Despite the city's status as the state capital, the 1850 census counted only 1,881 residents, and by 1900 the population of Jackson had grown only to approximately 8,000. It was during this period, roughly between 1890 and 1930, that [[Meridian, Mississippi|Meridian]] became Mississippi's largest city. By 1944, Jackson's population had risen to some 70,000 inhabitants. Since that time, it has continuously been the largest city in the state. Large-scale growth, however, did not come until the 1970s, after the turbulence of the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. The 1980 census counted over 200,000 residents in the city for the first time. Since then, Jackson has steadily seen a decline in its population, while its suburbs have evidenced a boom. This change has occurred in part due to [[white flight]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://majorityinms.com/2011/02/07/some-census-quick-hits/ Some Census Quick Hits]&lt;/ref&gt; a trend that has slowed over the past decade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2011/mar/16/jackson-white-flight-slows-in-last-decade/ White Flight Slows Down Last Decade]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of the [[United States Census, 2000|census]]{{GR|2|dateform=mdy}} of 2010, there were 173,514 people, and 62,400 households.  The population density was 1,562.5 people per square mile. There were 74,537 housing units. The racial makeup of the city was 79.4% [[African American (U.S. Census)|Black]] or [[Race (United States Census)|African American]], 18.4% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]] or Euro American, 0.1% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 0.4% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], and 0.9% from two or more races. 1.6% of the population were [[Hispanics in the United States|Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]] of any race.&lt;ref name=&quot;census&quot;/&gt; [[Non-Hispanic Whites]] were 18% of the population in 2010,&lt;ref name=&quot;census&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/28/2836000.html |title=Jackson (city), Mississippi |work=State &amp; County QuickFacts |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |accessdate=May 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; down from 60% in 1970.&lt;ref name=&quot;census1&quot; &gt;{{cite web|title=Mississippi - Race and Hispanic Origin for Selected Cities and Other Places: Earliest Census to 1990|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|url=http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html|accessdate=May 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were 267,841 households out of which 39.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 35.4% were married couples living together, 25.3% had a female householder with no husband present, and 34.4% were non-families. 28.9% of all households were made up of individuals and 9.0% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.  The average household size was 2.61 and the average family size was 3.24. Same-sex couple households comprised 0.8% of all househoulds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/CTTable?_ts=266690849265 |title=2000 Census Data on Same-sex couple households |publisher=Factfinder.census.gov |accessdate=January 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The age of the population was spread out with 28.5% under the age of 18, 12.4% from 18 to 24, 29.1% from 25 to 44, 19.1% from 45 to 64, and 10.9% who were 65 years of age or older.  The median age was 31 years. For every 100 females, there were 86.9 males.  For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 81.5 males.

The median income for a household in the city was $30,414, and the median income for a family was $36,003. Males had a median income of $29,166 versus $23,328 for females. The per capita income for the city was $17,116.  About 19.6% of families and 23.5% of the population were below the [[poverty]] line, including 33.7% of those under age 18 and 15.7% of those age 65 or over.&lt;ref&gt;[http://censtats.census.gov/data/MS/1602836000.pdf Profile of General Demographic Characteristics: 2000], [[United States Census Bureau]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, [[WAPT (TV)|WAPT]]: [[American Broadcast Company|ABC]] posted an article about Jackson projected to grow after 30 years. While Jackson's population declined, it's suburbs experienced growth, but it could soon change. After 1980, the population decreased all the way to the 2010 Census with 173,514 citizens. ''Whether it is flattening out, or what it could be, we don't know exactly,'' said Mark Monk of the Central Mississippi Planning and Development District. Monk also mentioned that it is just a one year estimate, so it is not all accurate. Jackson was projected to grow, but only by 1.1%. On the other hand, [[Madison County, Mississippi|Madison]] was projected to grow 1.8 &amp; [[Rankin County, Mississippi|Rankin]] had a projection of 1.5%.

Jackson is served by '''[[Jackson-Evers International Airport]]''', located at Allen C. Thompson Field, east of the city in [[Pearl, Mississippi|Pearl]] in Rankin County. Its IATA code is JAN. The airport has non-stop service to 12 cities throughout the United States and is served by 5 scheduled carriers (American, Delta, United, Southwest, and US Airways)

On December 22, 2004, Jackson City Council members voted 6–0 to rename Jackson International Airport in honor of slain [[Civil Rights Movement|civil rights]] leader and field secretary for the Mississippi chapter of the [[NAACP]], [[Medgar Evers]]. This decision took effect on January 22, 2005.

Formerly Jackson was served by Hawkins Field Airport, located in northwest Jackson, with IATA code HKS, which is now used for private air traffic only.

Underway is the [[Airport Parkway (Mississippi)|Airport Parkway]] project. The environmental impact study is complete and final plans are drawn and awaiting Mississippi Department of Transportation approval. Right-of-way acquisition is underway at an estimated cost of $19&amp;nbsp;million. The Airport Parkway will connect High Street in downtown Jackson to [[Mississippi Highway 475]] in [[Flowood, Mississippi|Flowood]] at Jackson-Evers International Airport. The Airport Parkway Commission consists of the Mayor of Pearl, the Mayor of Flowood, and the Mayor of Jackson, as the Airport Parkway will run through and have access from each of these three cities.

[[File:Thalia Mara Hall Jackson Mississippi.jpg|thumb|right|[[Thalia Mara]] Hall in Jackson, Mississippi]]

===Tourism and culture===
Jackson is a city famous for its music – including [[Gospel music|Gospel]], [[Blues]], and [[R&amp;B]].  Jackson is also home to the world famous [[Malaco Records]] recording studio.  Many notable musicians hail from Jackson.

Jackson, MS is mentioned in the 1973 song &quot;[[Uneasy Rider]]&quot; by [[Charlie Daniels]].

Rap rocker [[Kid Rock]] made a song about Jackson, aptly titled &quot;[[Jackson, Mississippi (Kid Rock Song)|Jackson, Mississippi]]&quot;, in 2003.

The Rolling Stones sat &quot;in a bar tippling a jar in Jackson&quot; in their song 'Country Honk' on the 1969 album 'Let It Bleed'. &quot;And on the street the summer sun it shines. There's many a bar-room queen I've had in Jackson, but I just can't seem to drink you off my mind.&quot;

&quot;[[Jackson (song)|Jackson]]&quot; is a song written by [[Jerry Leiber]] and [[Billy Edd Wheeler]] about newlyweds making the discovery that, after jumping much too quickly into marriage, the &quot;fire&quot; has gone out of their relationship. They both want to go to Jackson, where each looks forward to a new life free of the other.  Although the song does not specify whether Jackson, TN or Jackson, MS is the destination, the lyrics do clearly reference gambling.  During the period from the 1920s until the 1960s, illegal gambling casinos flourished on the east side of the Pearl River, along the original [[U.S. Route 80]] just outside the city of Jackson, MS in Flowood.  The infamous casinos might have been the inspiration for those lyrics.

In any event, the best-known single releases of the song include the 1968 [[Grammy Award]] winner by [[Johnny Cash]] and [[June Carter Cash]], and the hit [[Nancy Sinatra]] and [[Lee Hazlewood]] version from the same year.  Much later, the song was performed by [[Joaquin Phoenix]] and [[Reese Witherspoon]] (playing Johnny Cash and June Carter) in the 2005 film ''[[Walk the Line]]''.

Those illegal casinos referenced (perhaps) by the song, along with bootleg liquor stores and nightclubs, made up the Gold Coast, a strip of mostly black-market businesses which operated for decades along Flowood Road, just across the Pearl River from downtown Jackson.  Though it existed outside the law, the Gold Coast was a thriving center of nightlife and music, with many local blues musicians appearing in the clubs regularly.  The Gold Coast disappeared after Mississippi's prohibition laws were repealed in 1966, allowing Hinds County, including Jackson, to go &quot;wet&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://blues.goodbarry.com/_webapp_2758974/Gold_Coast&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, the [[USA International Ballet Competition]] was founded in Jackson by [[Thalia Mara]], who is also the namesake of Thalia Mara Hall where the competition is held. The following year saw the first USA International Ballet Competition held as part of the worldwide International Ballet Competition (IBC), which itself originated in [[Varna, Bulgaria]] in 1964. The competition eventually expanded to rotating annual events between Jackson, Varna, Moscow and Tokyo. It was in 1979 that the event first came to the United States, to Jackson, where it now returns every four years. The rotation is currently among Jackson, Varna, [[Helsinki]], and [[Shanghai]]. Jackson has been the host of the IBC in 1979, 1982, 1986, 1990, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, and 2010. The next competition in Jackson will be in 2014. The United States Congress recognized Jackson and the USA IBC in 1982 by passing a Joint Resolution designating Jackson as the official home of the USA IBC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&lt;!-- .entry-content --&gt; |url=http://www.usaibc.com/ |title=USA International Ballet Competition |publisher=Usaibc.com |accessdate=January 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Historic marker====
Jackson, Mississippi received its first [[Mississippi Blues Trail]] designation. The ceremony was held and the historic marker placed on the  former site of the Subway Lounge on Pearl Street. The Subway Lounge was in the basement of the old Summers Hotel, one of two hotels available as lodging to blacks before desegregation when it opened in 1943. In the 1960s, the hotel added a [[lounge music|lounge]] in the basement that featured [[jazz]]. In the 1980s, when the lounge was revived, it was catered to late night [[blues]] performers. In 2002, the Subway Lounge was filmed for a documentary entitled ''Last of the Mississippi Jukes.''&lt;ref&gt;

'''Diamondhead''' is a city in southeastern [[Hancock County, Mississippi|Hancock County]], [[Mississippi]]. It is part of the [[Gulfport, Mississippi|Gulfport]]−[[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]], Mississippi [[Gulfport-Biloxi metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]]. The population was 8,425 as of the [[2010 U.S. census|2010 census]]. In February 2012, Diamondhead was officially incorporated as a city; previously, Diamondhead was a [[census-designated place]] (CDP).

==Geography==

Diamondhead is located at {{Coord|30|23|0|N|89|22|22|W|type:city}} (30.383444, -89.372660){{GR|1}}. Unlike most of the [[Mississippi Gulf Coast]], which is relatively level, the Diamondhead area has more rolling [[topography]].

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the CDP has a total area of {{convert|11.7|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|11.3|sqmi|km2}} are land and {{convert|0.4|sqmi|km2|adj=on}} (3.16%) is water.

==Incorporation==
In 2009, a petition supported by the Property Owners Association (POA) to hold an incorporation election was filed with the Hancock Chancery Court and an election approved the incorporation. Opponents contended that the petition lacked a sufficient number of signatures and that incorporation requirements were not complied with. In 2010, the Hancock Chancery court ruled against the opponents who then appealed to the Mississippi Supreme Court. Further, the appeal claimed irregularities during the hearing on the original objection. On October 29, 2011, the Mississippi Supreme Court upheld the Hancock Chancery court and ruled against the irregularity claims.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sea Coast Echo&quot;&gt;The Sea Coast Echo, October 29, 2011, http://12.68.233.230/40/article_5447.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2012, a motion for extension to appeal the decision was denied by the Supreme Court and a final edict mandating the incorporation was issued. The City of Diamondhead was presented its charter as the 111th city in Mississippi by Secretary of State Delbert Hoseman on February 6, 2012.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sun Herald&quot;&gt;The Sun Herald, February 6, 2012, http://www.sunherald.com/2012/02/06/3734646/diamondhead-receives-charter-as.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name and Hawaiian influence==

The town of Diamondhead was named after [[Diamond Head, Hawaii]]. This Hawaiian influence is applied throughout Diamondhead. Most of the roads are named with Hawaiian names, the various community centers and private homes have a Hawaiian look, including prominent [[Kona District, Hawaii|Kona]]/[[Tahiti]]an roof lines. Originally Diamondhead was designed by the developers in the 1970s to appeal to an older demographic looking for a place to retire near from [[New Orleans]], [[Gulfport, Mississippi|Gulfport]] and [[Biloxi]]. Over time it has slowly changed from a [[retirement community]] to a variety of age groups. Its residents now mostly consist of young families.

==Facilities==

Since most of Diamondhead was a planned community it has many facilities designed to attract home buyers. Some of these facilities include:

* Marina, Yacht Club, Tennis World, and Country Club with multiple dining facilities
* The Pines and Cardinal 18-Hole Professional Golf Courses (36 Holes)
* Community Pools throughout the area
* Community Center and Separate Adult Learning Center
* Community Grocery and Hardware Stores
* Multiple Ponds and Lakes
* Several Homes have direct access to the Gulf of Mexico, as well as the Marina and Yacht Club
* Several Restaurants, Bowling, Hotels, Automotive Stations
* Private airstrip including direct access between the airstrip and private homes allowing planes to be housed at a home owners house.

==New casinos==
The casino deal with [[Donald Trump]] and [[Diamondhead Casino Corporation]] at the front of Diamondhead had fallen through as of 1 March 1, 2007. DCC still wishes to proceed and establish a casino. The [[Isle of Capri Casinos|Isle of Capri]] construction plans at the [[Kiln, Mississippi|Kiln]]-[[DeLisle, Mississippi|DeLisle]] exit of [[Interstate 10]] had been canceled as of November 8, 2007.

As of late 2008, casinos had applied for zoning in the south side of Diamondhead that was obliterated by Hurricane Katrina. The Silver Slipper Casino from nearby [[Lakeshore, Mississippi|Lakeshore]] built a seafood restaurant, the Pier House now named the Hula Club, at the former site of the yacht club over the water. The eighty-eight acres north of there is also planned to be a major resort casino. It will be the only casino in Mississippi with virtually direct interstate access (I-10).

==Hurricane Katrina==

[[Image:Hurricane Katrina winds 1500utc29Aug05 landfall MS.gif|thumb|200px|right|Diamondhead on top of small bay in fuchsia]]
[[Diamondhead]] was one of the landfall communities of [[Hurricane Katrina]], which inflicted severe damage. It was hit by the most dangerous north east/eastern [[eye wall]] of Hurricane Katrina and probably experienced the highest winds seen in Mississippi{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}. Greatly contributing to the extensive damage was a record [[storm surge]] of 25–28&amp;nbsp;feet (8.5m). Nearly all of the 200 homes and townhomes facing the water on the south side of Diamondhead were obliterated. The north side fared better, and many of the people whose homes had been destroyed in neighboring cities, as well as in Diamondhead, moved into the houses which remained on the north side. Overnight, the population swelled from 6500 to 9000.

The commercial center, including stores and restaurants, was mostly destroyed and has since been rebuilt.

==Education==
Diamondhead is served by the [[Hancock County School District]].
Local schools of interest include [[Saint Stanislaus College|St. Stanislaus Catholic School]] (boys) and [[Our Lady Academy]] (girls).

As of the [[census]] of 2000, there were 18,393 people, 6,925 households, and 4,542 families residing in the city. The [[population density]] was 1,192.3 people per square mile (460.2/km²). There were 7,804 housing units at an average density of 505.9 per square mile (195.3/km²).

There has been a steady influx of Hispanic migrant labor in the last few years, most of them being employed at Howard Industries, Sanderson Farms and independent labor. Companies in the area tend to recruit foreign workers due to the benefits of the federal government subsidizing
their cost for training of those on worker visas. Those on visas also tend to be paid substantially less. There has been some debate regarding the legal status of the majority of these workers, particularly after [[Immigration Customs and Enforcement]] arrested nearly 600 suspected illegal immigrants at the Howard Industries plant on August 26, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Gaynor |last=Tim |title=U.S. immigration cops nab 595 in largest-ever raid |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSN2635579820080827 |work=reuters.com |publisher=Reuters |date=2008-08-26 |accessdate=2008-08-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tupelo''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|uː|p|əl|oʊ}} is the [[county seat]] and the largest city of [[Lee County, Mississippi|Lee County]], [[Mississippi]]. It is also the seventh-largest city in the state. It is situated in northeast Mississippi, between [[Memphis, Tennessee]], and [[Birmingham, Alabama]], and is accessed by [[U.S. Route 78]]. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the population was 34,546, with the surrounding counties of Lee, [[Pontotoc County, Mississippi|Pontotoc]] and [[Itawamba County, Mississippi|Itawamba]] supporting a population of 138,976.

The city is best known as the birthplace of [[Elvis Presley]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TupeloAttract&quot; /&gt; As an infant in Tupelo in 1936, Presley survived a [[Tupelo-Gainesville tornado outbreak|tornado]] that was ranked as the fourth deadliest in United States history and killed more than 230 people.

==History==

===European colonization===
[[Indigenous peoples]] lived in the area for thousands of years, followed by the historical peoples of the [[Chickasaw]] and [[Choctaw]], both [[Muskogean]]-speaking peoples of the Southeast.

On May 26, 1736 the [[Battle of Ackia]] was fought near the site of the present Tupelo; [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] and [[Chickasaw]] soldiers repelled a [[French colonization of the Americas|French]] and [[Choctaw]] attack on the then-Chickasaw village of Ackia. The French, under [[Louisiana]] governor [[Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville|Jean Baptiste Le Moyne]], Sieur de Bienville, had sought to link Louisiana with [[Acadia]] and the other northern colonies of [[New France]].

In later times, after years of trading and encroachment, conflicts increased in the early 19th century with European-American settlers. In 1830 Congress passed the [[Indian Removal Act]] and authorized the relocation of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] west of the [[Mississippi River]], which was completed by the end of the 1830s.

In the early years of settlement, European-Americans named the town '''Gum Pond,''' supposedly due to its numerous [[tupelo]] trees, which are locally known as ''blackgum''. The city still hosts the annual Gumtree Arts Festival. The Southern expression, &quot;possum up a gum tree&quot;, originated in this area.&lt;ref name=&quot;TupeloAttract&quot;&gt;[http://www.tupeloms.gov/attractions/TupeloMS-Attractions &quot;City of Tupelo - Attractions&quot;], 2006, City of Tupelo website&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil War and Post-War development===
During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Union and Confederate forces fought in the area in 1864 in the battle known as a [[Battle of Tupelo]]. Designated the [[Tupelo National Battlefield]], the war site is administered by the [[National Park Service]] (NPS). In addition, the [[Brices Cross Roads National Battlefield]], about ten miles north, commemorates another Civil War site.

After the Civil War, a cross-state [[railroad]] for northern Mississippi was constructed through the town, which encouraged industry and growth. With expansion, the town changed its name to Tupelo, in honor of the battle. It was incorporated in 1870.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dale Cox |url=http://www.exploresouthernhistory.com/tupelo.html |title=Tupelo, Mississippi - Historic Sites and Points of Interest |publisher=Exploresouthernhistory.com |date=1935-01-08 |accessdate=2013-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early twentieth century, the town had become a site of [[textile mill]]s, which employed both [[White people|white]] adults and children. Reformers documented the child workers and attempted to protect them through labor laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gumtreechronicles.com/tupelo.html |title=Tupelo, MS |publisher=GumTree Chronicles |date= |accessdate=2013-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last known bank robbery by [[Machine Gun Kelly]], a [[Prohibition]]-era gangster, took place on November 30, 1932 at the Citizen’s State Bank in Tupelo; his gang netted $38,000. After the robbery, the bank’s chief teller said of Kelly, “He was the kind of guy that, if you looked at him, you would never thought he was a bank robber.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

During the [[Great Depression]] Tupelo was [[Electrification|electrified]] by the new [[Tennessee Valley Authority]], which had constructed dams and power plants  to harness water power throughout the region. In 1935, President [[Franklin Roosevelt]] visited this &quot;First TVA City&quot;.

===The Tupelo tornado===
The Spring of 1936 brought Tupelo one of its worst-ever natural disasters.  Part of the [[1936 Tupelo-Gainesville tornado outbreak|Tupelo-Gainesville outbreak]] of April 5–6 in that year,&lt;ref&gt;[http://dlg.galileo.usg.edu/tornado/exhibit/ &quot;Tupelo-Gainesville Outbreak&quot;], Digital Library of Georgia, 2008, retrieved 12 Sept 2011&lt;/ref&gt; the Tupelo storm struck at night and destroyed large residential areas on the city's north side. One survivor of the storm was [[Elvis Presley]], then a baby. Obliterating the Gum Pond neighborhood, the tornado dropped most of the victims' bodies in the pond. The storm has since been rated F5 on the modern [[Fujita scale]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/tornadoes-devastate-tupelo-and-gainesville &quot;This Day In History; Tornadoes Devastate Tupelo and Gainesville&quot;], The History Channel online, retrieved 13 Sept 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The Tupelo Tornado is recognized as one of the deadliest in U.S. History.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/30/us/deadliest-tornadoes |title=The 10 deadliest U.S. tornadoes on record |publisher=CNN.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Tupelo tornado leveled 48 city blocks and over 200 homes, killing 216 people and injuring more than 700 persons. The Mississippi State Geologist estimated a final death toll of 233, but 100 white persons were still hospitalized at the time. Because newspapers published only the names of injured whites, due to a racially discriminatory policy that persisted into the 1940s and 1950s, it was difficult to follow up on the fates of injured blacks. Historians now estimate the death toll was higher than in official records.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSouth&quot;&gt;[http://www.midsouthtornadoes.msstate.edu/info.php?id=162&amp;county=Itawamba&amp;state=MS&amp;count=2 &quot;Significant Tornadoes Update 1992-1995&quot;], Mid-South Tornadoes, Mississippi State University&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martis D. Ramage, Jr. ''Tupelo, Mississippi, Tornado of 1936'',&lt;/ref&gt; Fire broke out at the Lee County Training School, which was destroyed. Its bricks were salvaged for other uses.

The area is subject to tornadoes. In 2008 one rated an EF3 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale struck the town.

===Current events===
In 2007, the nearby village of [[Blue Springs, Mississippi|Blue Springs]] was selected as the site for [[Toyota]]'s eleventh U.S. automobile manufacturing plant.

'''Cleveland''' is a city in [[Bolivar County, Mississippi|Bolivar County]], [[Mississippi]]. The population was 12,334 as of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].

Cleveland has a fairly large commercial economy, with numerous restaurants, stores, and services along [[U.S. Route 61]]. Cleveland is one of the two county seats (the other being [[Rosedale, Mississippi|Rosedale]]) of Bolivar County, which was named for the South American liberator [[Simon Bolivar]].

==History==
Named after President [[Grover Cleveland]], the town began formation in 1869 as people moved inland from the [[Mississippi River]]. The [[Louisville and Nashville Railroad|Louisville, New Orleans &amp; Texas Railroad]] ran through the town and a portion of the railroad remains there today. Early records show the community was called Fontaine in 1884 and at some point Coleman's Station. Moses W. Coleman built the first home on the [[bayou]] in the area. In 1885, it was officially named Sims after Rueben T. Sims, who owned part of the land on which the town stood. The village of Cleveland was chartered on March 25, 1886, and the United States Post Office recognized the town as such on August 5, 1887. It was Sims's son, B.C. Sims, who was responsible for the name change to Cleveland.

==Geography==
Cleveland is located at {{coord|33|44|31|N|90|43|36|W|type:city}} (33.742027, -90.726548){{GR|1}}.

== History ==

Work crew repaving street. |url=http://mdah.state.ms.us/arrec/digital_archives/series/corinth/detail/3519 |publisher=[[Mississippi Department of Archives and History]] |accessdate=2 December 2011 |author=McCord's Studio}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Corinth was founded in 1853 as Cross City, so-called because it served as a junction for the [[Mobile and Ohio Railroad|Mobile &amp; Ohio]] and [[Memphis and Charleston Railroad|Memphis &amp; Charleston]] railroads. It was the town's early newspaper editor, W. E. Gibson, who suggested the name of [[Corinth]], named for the city in Greece that also served as a crossroads.

Corinth's location at the junction of two railroads made it strategically important to the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]]. Confederate [[General]] [[P. G. T. Beauregard]] retreated to Corinth after the [[Battle of Shiloh]], pursued by [[Union army|Union]] [[Major General]] [[Henry Halleck|Henry W. Halleck]]. General Beauregard abandoned the town when General Halleck approached, letting it fall into the Union's hands. Since Halleck approached so cautiously, digging entrenchments at every stop for over a month, this action has been known as the [[Siege of Corinth]].

The Union sent Maj. Gen. [[William Rosecrans]] to Corinth as well and concentrated its forces in the city. The [[Second Battle of Corinth]] took place on October 3−4, 1862, when Confederate Maj. Gen. [[Earl Van Dorn]] attempted to retake the city. The Confederate troops won back the city for a very brief period but were quickly forced out again on the same day when the Union troops were reinforced.
