'''Oneonta'''  ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|oʊ|n|i|ˈ|ɒ|n|t|ə}} {{respell|OH|nee|ON|tə}}) is a [[Administrative divisions of New York#City|city]] in southern [[Otsego County, New York|Otsego County]], [[New York]], USA. According to the 2010 [[U.S. Census]], it had a population of 13,901.{{GR|2}} Its nickname is &quot;City of the Hills.&quot; While the word &quot;oneonta&quot; is of undetermined origin, it is popularly believed to mean &quot;place of open rocks&quot; in the Iroquois language. This refers to a prominent geological formation known as &quot;Tablerocks&quot; at the western end of the city.

The city is surrounded by the [[Administrative divisions of New York#Town|town]] of [[Oneonta (town), New York|Oneonta]], a separate municipal and political jurisdiction. 

Oneonta Municipal Airport (N66) is north of the city.

== History ==
[[File:PostcardOneontaNYMainStCirca1909.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Main Street, about 1909]]
Prehistorically, Algonquin and Iroquois Native Americans inhabited the land around what is today the city of Oneonta.  The Iroquois gained exclusive control during the early historic period. 

The area's early pioneers arrived around 1775 and consisted mainly of Palatine Germans and Dutch settlers moving out of the Hudson Valley. 
The first settler in the area now known as the town of Oneonta is considered to be Henry Scramling (b. ~1743; d. 1808)  He secured a grant of 1,000 acres in the Susquehanna Valley, moved from German Flats in the Mohawk Valley and settled in the Oneonta Plains near the mouth of the Otego Creek several years (about 1773) before the Revolutionary War.  He left during the Revolution and returned after the conflict with his brothers, George and David, and his brothers-in-law, John and David Young.  Their farms were not far from the mouth of the Otego Creek.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~greenefamily/Cemetery/ScramlingCemetery.htm |title=Scramling Cemetery, West Oneonta, NY |deadurl=no |accessdate=2012-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The army led by [[James Clinton|General James Clinton]] passed through the area in order to join the [[Sullivan Expedition]] in 1779. 

The first [[Administrative divisions of New York#Hamlet|hamlet]] appeared around 1800 and was later known as &quot;Milfordville.&quot; In 1830, the town of Oneonta was formed from parts of two other towns in the county. Milfordville changed its name to Oneonta in 1832, and, in 1848, [[Municipal incorporation|incorporated]] as a [[Administrative divisions of New York#Village|village]] within the town. 

When the [[Delaware and Hudson Railroad]] reached Oneonta, the village began a growth spurt due to its role as a railroad center and its growing industries. Oneonta was once home to the largest locomotive [[roundhouse]] in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;oneonta&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oneonta.ny.us/oneonta/historic.asp |title=History of Oneonta |last=New York|first=Oneonta |publisher=Oneonta.New York.US |accessdate=2006-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The village incorporated as a city in 1908.

==Geography==
Oneonta is located at {{Coord|42|27|21|N|75|3|44|W|type:city}} (42.456003, -75.062302).{{GR|1}}
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 4.4&amp;nbsp;square miles (11.3&amp;nbsp;km²). None of the area is covered with water. 

The city is in the northern foothills of the [[Catskill Mountains]], lying between [[Binghamton, New York|Binghamton]] and [[Albany, New York|Albany]].

The [[Susquehanna River]] flows westward past the south part of the city.

==Architecture==
The architecture of Oneonta is mostly plain townhouses, and low-rise commercial buildings. Oneonta has very few industrial complexes. Because of its location, Oneonta does not serve as a prime industrial city. 

There are several historic buildings that were originally homes of prominent people. The [[Fairchild Mansion]] was placed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1974 and was formerly the home of George Winthrop Fairchild, one of the original partners with Thomas Watson.  Fairchild and Watson were the founders of what eventually became IBM. Also, [[George I. Wilber House]] is a historic home located in the City. It was built in two phases, 1875 and about 1890. It is a three story wood frame structure on a stone foundation in the Late Victorian style. It features a three story, round corner tower, cross gabled roof, and a large, very decorative wrap-around porch with a porte-cochere. In 1997 it became home to the Upper Catskill Community Council of the Arts. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;nris&quot;&gt;{{NRISref|2009a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also listed on the National Register of Historic Places are: [[Bresee Hall]], [[Chapin Memorial Church]], [[Ford Block]], [[Fortin Site]], [[Municipal Building (Oneonta, New York)|Municipal Building]], [[Oneonta Armory]], [[Stonehouse Farm]], [[Oneonta Theatre]], [[Old Post Office (Oneonta, New York)|Old Post Office]], [[Oneonta Downtown Historic District]], and [[Walnut Street Historic District (Oneonta, New York)|Walnut Street Historic District]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nris&quot;/&gt;

The tallest building in Oneonta is Nader Towers.  Standing 14-stories high, the building is owned by the City of Oneonta Housing Authority and is operated as a senior citizen's housing dwelling.

'''Rensselaer''' is a [[Administrative divisions of New York#City|city]] in [[Rensselaer County, New York]], located along the [[Hudson River]] directly opposite [[Albany, New York]]. As of the [[2010 U.S. census]], the population was about 9,400 people.{{GR|2}} In the year 1920, it was about 10,840. The name is from [[Kiliaen van Rensselaer (Dutch merchant)|Kiliaen van Rensselaer]], the original landowner of the region in [[New Netherland]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Rensselaer is on the west border of the county. Earliest settlement occurred as early as 1628. This town has a rich industrial history stretching back to the 19th century, when it became a major [[railroad]] junction. It is still important in railroading as the location of the 14th busiest [[Amtrak]] station in the country. It was one of the earliest locations of the dye industry in the United States, and the first American location for the production of [[aspirin]].

== History ==

===Early settlement and growth===
The natives of the area called it Petuquapoern and Juscum catick, and the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] claimed the land in 1609 based on [[Henry Hudson]]'s exploration of the [[Hudson River]]. Later the area was called [[De Laet's Burg]] in honor of one of the directors of the Dutch West India Co. Settlement occurred at least as early as 1628. By 1642 there was a brewery and many farms, also a ferry was established by Hendrick Albertsen running from the mouth of Beaver Creek in [[Beverwyck]] (Albany) to the future Rensselaer.&lt;ref name=Ray&gt;{{cite web | title = History of Greenbush, New York| author = George Baker Anderson | publisher = D. Mason and Company | url = http://history.rays-place.com/ny/ren-greenbush-ny.htm | accessdate = 2010-01-02 | year = 1897}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greenbush (originally t'Greyn Bos in Dutch) was the earliest settlement from Dutch times. The hamlet of East Albany was part of the village of Greenbush. The second hamlet that would be incorporated was Bath (also Bath-on-Hudson), which was laid out in 1795 and settled even earlier,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The History of New York State: Book III | author = Dr. James Sullivan | accessdate = 2010-01-02 | year = 1927 | publisher = Lewis Historical Publishing Company, Inc | url = http://www.usgennet.org/usa/ny/state/his/bk3/ch6.html}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was incorporated as a village prior to 1874.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = New York Supplement: Volume 58 | publisher = State of New York | page = 271 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=q4A7AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA271&amp;dq=bath-on-hudson&amp;cd=3#v=onepage&amp;q=bath-on-hudson&amp;f=false | accessdate = 2010-01-03 | year = 1899}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:FortCrailo HABS cropped.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Fort Crailo in HABS photo, c. 1940]]
The Van Rensselaer family, which were the feudal landholders of the entire future Rensselaer County built a residence in the future city of Rensselaer. This property was inherited by [[Hendrick van Rensselaer]], [[Kiliaen van Rensselaer (Dutch merchant)|Kiliaen van Rensselaer]]'s grandson, who built [[Fort Crailo]] in approximately 1712.&lt;ref name=&quot;nhlsum&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nrhpinv&quot;/&gt; It was built on the site of where Dominie Megapolensis built his own house in 1642.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Fort Orange and Schuyler Flatts NHL | author = Paul Huey | accessdate = 2010-01-03 | url = http://crm.cr.nps.gov/archive/18-7/18-7-6.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crailo was expanded in 1762-1768. At various times, the grounds were used as a campground for British and colonial troops. It is reportedly the place where, in 1755, British Army surgeon Richard Shuckburgh, quartered in the home, wrote the ditty &quot;[[Yankee Doodle]]&quot; to mock the colonial troops who fought with the British in the [[French and Indian Wars]]. Fort Crailo was declared a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1961.&lt;ref name=&quot;nhlsum&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=406&amp;ResourceType=Building

The [[Administrative divisions of New York#Hamlet|hamlet]] of Greenbush was a tract of land about one square mile in size, and is that portion of the city between Partition and Mill Street. This was purchased in May 1810 by William Akin, Titus Goodman and John Dickinson from [[Stephen Van Rensselaer]] and Stephen N. Bayard, assignees of John J. Van Rensselaer. The village was later [[Municipal corporation|incorporated]] in 1815. A new charter was granted in 1828, which was amended in 1854, and again in 1863, and a new charter in 1871.&lt;ref name=Ray/&gt; In 1897, Greenbush was [[Municipal charter|chartered]] as a city, and its name was changed to Rensselaer. Its limits were extended in 1902 by the annexation of the village of Bath and the western part of the town of [[East Greenbush, New York|East Greenbush]].

===Industrialization and modernization===
In the 19th century Rensselaer became the site of the [[Boston and Albany Railroad|Boston &amp; Albany Railroad]]'s (B&amp;A) passenger depot, shops, freight houses, round house, and coach yard. It was the site of transfers between trains of the [[New York Central Railroad]] and the B&amp;A. A [[ferry]] transported people to and from the [[Van Rensselaer Island]] and [[Downtown Albany Historic District|downtown Albany]] at [[Streets of Albany, New York#Maiden Lane and Pine Street|Maiden Lane]]. In 1871 the [[Maiden Lane Bridge]] was built replacing the ferry. In 1903 the channel that separated the island from the mainland was filled in with sand dredged from the bottom of the Hudson River.&lt;ref name=Waterfront&gt;{{cite web | title = Cultural Impact Assessment | publisher = U.W. Marx, Inc. | author = Stephen Oberon | url = http://www.uwmarx.com/waterfront/newsite/DEIS/Appendix%20E%20-%20Cultural%20Impact%20Assessment.pdf | accessdate = 2009-07-29 | year = 2008}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the NY Central and the B&amp;A merged in 1900 the island's activities became less important, though a new round house and coach yard was built even as many buildings were demolished.&lt;ref name=Waterfront/&gt;

[[File:Albany Aniline and Chemical.jpg|thumb|right|Hudson River Aniline and Color Works in the early 20th century]]
In 1882 the Hudson River Aniline and Color Works built their first plant in Rensselaer (building 61), however it burned 13 years later. In 1895 Building 61 was rebuilt and at the same time Building 71 was built as well.&lt;ref name=BASF&gt;{{cite web | title = History of Internal Growth of BASF Rensselaer Plant | url = http://www.colorantshistory.org/BASFPlantBldgHistory.html | publisher = ColorantsHistory.Org | accessdate = 2010-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would be acquired by the [[Bayer Corporation]] 1903,&lt;ref name=Colorants/&gt; which then built one of the largest and most up-to-date factories of its time in the US and the Rensselaer plant became the American home for the production of [[brand-name]] [[History of aspirin|Aspirin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Aspirin: The Remarkable Story of a Wonder Drug | page = 84 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=x-sL4iNQOgcC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;lpg=PA84&amp;dq=rensselaer+aspirin+1903&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fItKVeuQrS&amp;sig=2wgZnEfD_jJMeQBGef-YKX3M6w0&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=4_xDS6-KHo7kMZWt-IEM&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CBIQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=rensselaer%20aspirin%201903&amp;f=false | publisher = Bloomsbury Publishing | author = Diarmuid Jeffreys | accessdate = 2010-01-05 | year = 2005 | ISBN = 1-58234-386-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US government seized the property in 1917 during [[World War I]] as enemy property, Bayer being a [[Germany|German]] company.&lt;ref name=Colorants/&gt; It would later be owned by the [[General Aniline and Film]] Company, and then [[BASF]].&lt;ref name=Colorants&gt;{{cite web | title = Colorants Industry History | url = http://www.colorantshistory.org/home.html | publisher = ColorantsHistory.Org | accessdate = 2010-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927 it was the first plant to produce solid [[diazo]] salts in the United States.&lt;ref name=Dye/&gt; The plant went through 12 separate owners or subsidiaries in its lifetime, in the 1990s it was the oldest dye plant in continuous operation and also produced more dye than any other plant in the United States.&lt;ref name=Dye&gt;{{cite web | title = Rensselaer Dye Industry | publisher = AATCC | url = http://www.colorantshistory.org/RensselaerDyeIndustry.html | author = Leander Richard | year = 1994 | accessdate = 2010-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a promotional brochure issued around 1993 by the BASF Corporation the Rensselaer plant was the largest [[North America]]n dyestuffs production facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = BASF Rensselaer Descriptive Brochure ca. 1993 | publisher = BASF | accessdate = 2010-01-05 | url = http://www.colorantshistory.org/RensselaerBrochure.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plant was shut down for good on December 28, 2000.

In 1932 next to the BASF plant, the [[Port of Albany-Rensselaer]] was built, mostly in neighboring [[Albany, New York|Albany]], but also with {{convert|35|acre|m2}} in the southern part of Rensselaer. The docks on the Rensselaer side were built in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=Energy&gt;{{cite web |author = Eric Anderson | title = Energy fuels Port of Albany growth | date = September 21, 2008 | publisher = ''[[Albany Times Union]]'' | accessdate = 2008-11-30 | url = http://timesunion.com/AspStories/story.asp?storyID=721469&amp;category=MULTIMEDIA&amp;BCode=&amp;newsdate=11/26/08}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[Image:Dunn Memorial Bridge stub end.jpg|thumb|right|The stubs at the Dunn Memorial Bridge's Rensselaer end, built for the cancelled South Mall Expressway extension to I-90]]
[[Image:Old Albany Amtrak station.jpg|Old 1980 Amtrak station|thumb|left]]
The 1960s were a major time of change for the city of Rensselaer. In 1967 the current [[Dunn Memorial Bridge]] was built between Albany and Rensselaer. Though the bridge was to continue east through Rensselaer, with the [[South Mall Arterial]] connecting with [[Interstate 90]] at Exit 8, this extension never materialized. In 1968 the [[Amtrak]] station in Albany ([[Union Station (Albany)|Union Station]]) was relocated to Rensselaer; the Maiden Lane Bridge and all the railroad associated buildings were demolished when in 1969 the Rensselaer City School high/middle school campus was built north of Quackenderry Creek.&lt;ref name=Waterfront/&gt;

In the 2000s, another wave of development has been occurring in Rensselaer. The Rensselaer City School campus had planned to redevelop as a mixed-use waterfront community, the developers (U.W. Marx Construction) gave the school land that had recently been annexed from a neighboring town, now in the northern section of the city, and built a new school campus. The new school replaced the Rensselaer Middle High School and Van Rensselaer Elementary, formerly Van Rensselaer High, as a K-12 facility. Doane Stuart occupies the former elementary school.  Much to the delight of many alumni, the high school has been demolished, although the football field was left in for some time. The redevelopment of the waterfront property is named de Laet's Landing in honor of Johan de Laet. There has yet to be any breaking ground. The entrance to the site and parking lot is now a gated off clearing on the banks beside the Hudson, with a view of the Albany Skyline in the back. In 2002 the current [[Albany-Rensselaer (Amtrak station)|Albany-Rensselaer station]] replaced the adjacent 1968 and 1980 stations, which have been demolished since. Today's station was built with three tracks (a fourth was planned, but eliminated due to cost) and the station has had fewer than preferable tracks since. In January 2007, it was announced that a fourth track would be built, allowing freight trains to bypass the station and reduce delays.

==Geography==
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|3.3|sqmi|km2}}, of which, {{convert|3.0|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and {{convert|0.3|sqmi|km2}} of it (9.61%) is water. The city is flat along the western and southern areas but the center and northern areas slope steeply to the east.

The city lies next to the Hudson River with [[Albany County, New York|Albany County]] and the city of [[Albany, New York|Albany]] on the opposite shore. The town of [[North Greenbush, New York|North Greenbush]] borders the city to the north, and the town of [[East Greenbush, New York|East Greenbush]] is on the southern border; both towns border the city on the east with the dividing line between the two towns meeting Rensselaer in the middle section of the city's eastern boundary. Rensselaer's southern border is even with the city of Albany's southern border, however the northern border of Rensselaer is slightly south of Albany's corresponding northern border.

[[File:RensselaerRailStation.JPG|thumb|left|Albany-Rensselaer Amtrak Station.]]
[[Amtrak]], the national passenger rail system, provides service to Rensselaer through the Albany-Rensselaer Rail Station. The station also serves [[Albany, New York|Albany]], the state capital, and [[Troy, New York|Troy]], and it is designated in the Amtrak timetable as Albany-Rensselaer. Six ''[[Empire Service (train)|Empire Service]]'' trains run from Albany-Rensselaer to [[New York City]] on weekday mornings and several depart for New York in the evening, returning and terminating at Albany-Rensselaer in the afternoon and late evening. One section of the ''[[Lake Shore Limited]]'' originates in New York City and one section originates in [[Boston]]. The two sections are joined at Albany-Rensselaer and travel on to [[Union Station (Chicago)|Chicago]] as a single train. The eastbound ''Lake Shore Limited'' reverses the process at Albany-Rensselaer and splits into two trains for onward travel.

'''Cortland''' is a [[city]] in [[Cortland County, New York]], [[United States|USA]]. As of the 2010 census, the city had a population of 19,204. It is the [[county seat]] of [[Cortland County, New York|Cortland County]].{{GR|6}}

The City of Cortland, near the west border of the county, is surrounded by the [[Cortlandville, New York|Town of Cortlandville]].

== History ==
The city is within the former [[Central New York Military Tract]]. The city is named after [[Pierre Van Cortlandt]] the first Lieutenant Governor of the State of New York.

Cortland, settled in 1791, was made a village in 1853 (rechartered in 1864), and was [[incorporation (municipal government)|incorporated]] as a city in 1900 as the 41st city in the State of [[New York]]. When the county was formed in 1808, Cortland vied with other villages and won the status of becoming the county seat. The City of Cortland is the [[county seat]] of Cortland County. Known as the &quot;Crown City&quot; because of its location on a [[plain]] formed by the convergence of seven valleys, Cortland is situated about 1,130 feet (344 m) above sea level, making it the uppermost city to crown the state. Forty stars representing the 40 cities incorporated before Cortland circle the State of New York and Crown on the city's official seal. The seven points of the Crown create seven valleys depicting Cortland's seven surrounding valleys. The 41st star in the center of the Crown illustrates Cortland as the closest incorporated City to the geographic center of New York.

The leading industry in Cortland in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century was the Wickwire Brothers wire drawing mill, noted for its production of wire hardware cloth for use as window screens.  The extent of their wealth is commemorated in a pair of magnificent mansions, the Victorian Chateauesque style home of Chester Wickwire is now the 1890 House Museum &amp; Center For Victorian Arts while the 1912 home of Charles Wickwire is now called the SUNY Cortland Alumni House and is owned and operated by the SUNY Cortland Alumni Association.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the1890house.org/ The 1890 House Museum&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It is open to the public as well as being used by the Alumni Association to host College related events and house visiting dignitaries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cortland.edu/alumnihouse/ SUNY(State University of New York) Cortland Alumni House&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cortland was also home to a pioneering [[truck]] maker, [[Brockway Motor Company|Brockway]]. Begun in 1875 as Brockway Carriage Works, it was taken over by [[Mack Trucks|Mack]] in 1956, and survived until 1977. The city continues to host an annual show of Brockway trucks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brockwaytrucks.org/ Brockway Truck Preservation Association]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cortland also boasts a classic [[Octagon house]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.octagon.bobanna.com/ Octagon House Inventory&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1868 Cortland became the home of the Cortland Normal School, now the [[State University of New York at Cortland]].

In 2006, Cortland's historic clock tower burned down. It was later re-built, with spaces for both businesses and apartment style housing.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.9wsyr.com/news/local/story/3rd-anniversary-of-Cortland-clock-tower-fire/B_MkiwVtEkOxYhwyStLFkQ.cspx&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gloversville,''' in [[Fulton County, New York]], was once the hub of America's glovemaking industry with over two hundred manufacturers in Gloversville and the adjacent city of Johnstown.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} In 2000, Gloversville had a population of 15,413,{{GR|2|dateform=mdy}} and 15,665 in 2010.

==History==
The region, historically known as &quot;Kingsborough&quot;, was acquired by [[Sir William Johnson, 1st Baronet]]. In 1752, Arent Stevens bought land. [[Puritan]]s from [[New England]] settled there at the end of the 18th century. The proximity of [[hemlock]] forests to supply bark for [[tanning]] made the community a center of [[leather]] production early in its history. It earned its name for being the center of the American [[glove]] making industry for many years. Upon the establishment of a United States Post Office in 1828, Gloversville became the official name of the community.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} In 1890–1950, 90 percent of all gloves sold in the United States were made in Gloversville.&lt;ref name=&quot;heir&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/22/fashion/22GLOVERSVILLE.html?_r=2&amp;emc=eta1&amp;pagewanted=all |title=Heir to a Glove Town’s Legacy |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |first=Guy |last=Trebay |date=October 21, 2009 |accessdate=August 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Large tanneries and glove shops employed nearly 80% of the residents of Gloversville and environs.  Home workers sewed the gloves from leather that had been cut in factories. Related businesses, such as box makers, sewing machine repairmen, and thread dealers opened to serve the industry.

In 1853, Gloversville [[Municipal corporation|incorporated]] as a [[Administrative divisions of New York#Village|village]]. In 1890, it incorporated as a city.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cityofgloversville.com/ContentManager/index.cfm?Step=Display&amp;ContentID=5 |title=Community – Demographic/Historical |publisher=City of Gloversville |accessdate=August 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1936, Gloversville had a very active electric interurban line, the [[Fonda, Johnstown and Gloversville Railroad]]. It ran from Gloversville, through Johnstown, along the [[Mohawk River]] to Amsterdam, then to Scotia, then across the Mohawk River, and into downtown [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]] to the New York Central station. In 1932 in a bold move during the [[Great Depression]] it acquired unique Bullet cars in an attempt to revive business. Passenger service ended in 1936, but freight operation continued.&lt;ref&gt;Middleton. Bullet cars on the FJ&amp;G Railroad.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gloversville was the main headquarters for the [[Junius Myer Schine|Schine movie]] industry. The Glove Theatre was the Schines' favorite movie house. Hollywood movies sometimes premiered in Gloversville before they opened in California.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

The decline of the glove industry left the city financially depressed, with many downtown storefronts abandoned and store windows covered with plywood. Many of the houses were abandoned when people moved out of town to find jobs elsewhere.

==Geography and climate==
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|5.10|sqmi|km2}}, of which 0.20% is water.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYbyPlace&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/GCTTable?_bm=y&amp;-geo_id=04000US36&amp;-_box_head_nbr=GCT-PH1&amp;-ds_name=DEC_2000_SF1_U&amp;-_lang=en&amp;-redoLog=false&amp;-mt_name=DEC_2000_SF1_U_GCTPH1_ZI1&amp;-format=ST-7&amp;-_sse=on |title=New York by Place and County Subdivision |year=2000 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |accessdate=August 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[New York State Route 29A]] (Fulton Street) is an east-west road through the city. [[New York State Route 30A]] is a north-south highway through the east side of the city. Another north-south highway, [[New York State Route 309]] (Bleecker Street) terminates its southern reach at NY-29A in Gloversville.
The Cayadutta Creek flows southward through the city, which is southwest of the [[Great Sacandaga Lake]].

The city sits in the foothills of the [[Adirondack Mountains]] and therefore is within a climatic transition zone. Gloversville experiences the warmer summer temperatures common throughout the [[Capital District|Capital Region's]] [[Hudson Valley|Hudson]] and [[Mohawk Valley]]s while experiencing generally more copious precipitation throughout the year than the Capital Region. This manifests in commonplace rolling thunderstorms throughout the summer months and snowfall amounts more akin to the lake-pocked higher elevations of the Adirondacks in the winter months.

'''Oswego''' {{IPAc-en|ɒ|s|ˈ|w|iː|g|oʊ}} is a [[City (New York)|city]] in [[Oswego County, New York|Oswego County]], [[New York]], [[United States]].  The population was 18,142 at the [[United States Census, 2010|2010 census]]. Oswego is located on [[Lake Ontario]] in north-central [[New York]] and promotes itself as &quot;The Port City of Central New York&quot;. It is the county seat of [[Oswego County, New York|Oswego County]].

The city of Oswego is bordered by the towns of [[Oswego (town), New York|Oswego]], [[Minetto (town), New York|Minetto]], and [[Scriba, New York|Scriba]] to the west, south, and east, respectively, and by [[Lake Ontario]] to the north. [[Oswego Speedway]] is a nationally-known automobile racing facility. The [[State University of New York at Oswego]] is located just outside the city on the lake. Oswego is the namesake for communities in [[Oswego, Montana|Montana]], [[Lake Oswego, Oregon|Oregon]], [[Oswego, Illinois|Illinois]], and [[Oswego, Kansas|Kansas]].

==History==

===Early history===
The [[United Kingdom|British]] established a trading post in the area in 1722 and fortified it with a log palisade later called [[Fort Oswego]]. The first fortification on the site of the current [[Fort Ontario]] was built by the British in 1755 and called the &quot;Fort of the Six Nations.&quot;

===Military base===
Fort Ontario was destroyed by the French upon capturing it in the  [[Battle of Fort Oswego (1756)|Battle of Fort Oswego]], during the [[French and Indian War]]. Construction of a second British fort began on the same site in 1759, but Fort Oswego was only used as a cannon emplacement. During the American Revolution, the British abandoned the Fort, and in 1778, American troops destroyed it. In 1782, the British reoccupied Fort Ontario, and didn't forfeit it to the U.S. until 1796, thirteen years after the cessation of hostilities in the Revolution. During the [[War of 1812]], a weaker American garrison at Fort Oswego was [[Battle of Fort Oswego (1814)|overwhelmed]] by superior British forces, in order to stem the flow of supplies from the interior of New York state. Throughout the 19th Century, the U.S. military maintained a presence at Fort Ontario.

During WWII the Fort was used to house &quot;interned&quot; mainly Jewish Refugees.  (See the next section &quot;Safe Haven.&quot;)

In 1946, the Fort was transferred to the state of New York. At that time, it was used to house veterans and their families during the post-war period.

Development of the fort as a historic site began in 1949, which included the &quot;Safe Haven Museum&quot; (see above). The current fort was built between 1839 and 1844. Major masonry improvements to the forts outer wall were undertaken, but left incomplete when in 1872, congress cancelled its funding. By 1901, the old fort was abandoned.

Today, Fort Ontario is being restored to its 1867-1872 appearance. Costumed interpreters recreate the lives of the officers, men, and civilians who garrisoned the fort in 1868-1869.

===Safe Haven===
{{POV|date=June 2013}}
During the Second World War, the new fort was used as a '''''&quot;Safe Haven&quot;''''', (most importantly see [[Fort Ontario Emergency Refugee Shelter]]: and also [[Safe Haven Museum]]).  This was an emergency refugee center for victims of the [[Nazi Holocaust]], the only one of its kind in the U.S. A very moving personal account is given in reference &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.recognitionscience.com/cgv/oswego.htm |title=Oswego |publisher=Recognitionscience.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more generally in reference &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Central New York |url=http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2009/07/65_years_ago_this_summer_osweg.html |title=65 years ago this summer, Oswego was safe haven for nearly 1,000 refugees - mostly Jews - fleeing World War II |publisher=syracuse.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was the '''only''' attempt by the [[United States]] Government to shelter Jewish refugees during the war.

Approximately 1,000 War refugee families were brought here from Italy, but deliberately only from other parts of Europe.  They were all fleeing from the Nazis.  They were deliberately chosen so that some were non-Jewish to allay anti-semitic fears.

They were placed in Fort Oswego, behind barbed wire, and given no official status, and were told they would be returned to their homelands after the war, and would have no rights as regards entering the United States. (In fact, due to political pressure, at the war's end they were allowed to stay in the U.S.A.)

===Growth===

Oswego was incorporated as a village on March 14, 1828,&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=zHEFAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA392 ''Onondaga, or, Reminiscences of Earlier and Later Times''] by Joshua Victor Hopkins Clark and spouse Jenna Arcese (Syracuse, 1849; page 391)&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Oswego Canal]], a branch of the [[Erie Canal]], reached the area in 1829. The city was incorporated in 1848. When the city incorporated, its area and population were removed from the figures reported for the towns. In the 1850s, at the height of a popular [[Hydrotherapy#Hydrotherapy in the United States of America|water-cure]] movement occurring in the U.S.A., in turn stimulating growth, Oswego was the home of the ''Oswego Water Cure'' establishment, which Stonewall Jackson reportedly visited in August 1850.&lt;ref name=&quot;SamaritanMedCenter&quot;&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Stonewall Jackson and the Henderson Hydropath | title=in Samaritan Medical Center Newsletter|volume=No.42|url=http://library.samaritanhealth.com/library/Newsletter/SMCNewsletter42.pdf |author=Samaritan Medical Center| edition= |year=September 2008| publisher=|location=| page=|accessdate=13 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oswego is home to the [[port of Oswego]] and once was a major [[railroad]] hub for several major railroads: the [[New York Central Railroad]] (NYC), the [[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad]] (DL&amp;W), and the [[New York, Ontario and Western Railway]] (OW) railways. Both railways operated a [[coal trestle]] for fueling steamships at the Port of Oswego. Former NYC and DL&amp;W passenger stations remain, as does a NYC freight station. Nothing remains of the O&amp;W, which was abandoned in its entirety in 1957. The tunnel from the former OW is used as a [[rail trail]].

==Geography==
[[File:Oswego near harbour 05.07.2012 13-33-48.jpg|thumb|Oswego River flowing into Lake Ontario]]
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 11.2&amp;nbsp;square miles (29.1&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), of which, 7.7&amp;nbsp;square miles (19.8&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of it is land and 3.6&amp;nbsp;square miles (9.2&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of it (31.76%) is water.

Oswego is located on the southeastern shore of [[Lake Ontario]] at the mouth of the [[Oswego River (New York)|Oswego River]], about 35 miles north of [[Syracuse, New York]] and 69 miles east of [[Rochester, New York]].

[[New York State Route 481]] (from [[Interstate 81]]) runs north/south to Oswego from [[Syracuse, NY|Syracuse]] and [[Fulton, Oswego County, New York|Fulton]]. [[New York State Route 104]] runs east/west from [[Rochester, NY|Rochester]] to Oswego. The nearest city is [[Fulton, Oswego County, New York|Fulton]], located south of Oswego and north of Syracuse.

As Oswego is located on the eastern shore of [[Lake Ontario]], in the center of the [[Snowbelt]], the region often sees prodigious [[lake effect snow]] accumulations. Oswego is one of the snowiest towns in America, with some winters totaling over 300&amp;nbsp;inches. In 2007, Oswego gained national attention when approximately 130&quot; (slightly less than 11 feet) of snow fell in a two-week timespan. This broke the record of the [[Blizzard of 1966]], which blanketed the city with 102&quot; of snow. As a result of this storm, the school district closed all facilities for a week, effectively shifting the planned winter holiday.

==Culture and recreation==
[[File:Lighthouse in Oswego2.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Recreational fishing at Oswego, c. 1900.]]
Oswego has a long history stretching back to the 15th century. Visitors can learn about the city's history by visiting museums such as the [[H. Lee White Marine Museum]], The [[Richardson-Bates House]], and [[Fort Ontario]]. Throughout the city and public parks, many historical monuments can be found honoring historical figures, and other forts that stood in what is now the historical district. The city includes a number of sites on the [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Oswego County, New York|National Register of Historic Places]] including the [[Market House (Oswego, New York)|Market House]], [[Oswego Armory]], [[Oswego City Hall]], [[Oswego City Library]], [[Oswego County Courthouse]], [[Oswego Yacht Club]], [[Tanner Block]], and [[U.S. Customhouse (Oswego, New York)|U.S. Customhouse]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nris&quot;&gt;{{NRISref|2009a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most notable historian was Rosemary Nesbitt, who is immortalized by a monument in the city's signature public park, Breitbeck Park. Every [[Halloween]], she would traditionally let down her long silver hair, dress in a ghostly gown, and tell ghostly haunted tales spanning across the entire history of the city. Nesbitt, who also founded the Marine Museum and wrote various books about the city's history, died on August 2, 2009 at the age of 84.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palltimes.com/articles/2009/08/03/news/doc4a7622ccac56e444003853.txt |title=Historian leaves a legacy of her own - The Palladium-Times : News |publisher=Palltimes.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ludwig Bemelmans]], the writer best known for his popular '[[Madeline]]' stories, was stationed at Fort Ontario, Oswego, N.Y. from 1917. From this experience he wrote the book  &quot;My war with the United States&quot; published in 1937.

Boating, fishing, and hiking are also activities that are enjoyed by residents and visitors. Oswego also has three ice-skating rinks, a large public pool located on the Fort Ontario grounds, bowling, and the historic [[Oswego Theater]].

Every year the city hosts the [http://www.oswegoharborfest.com/ Oswego Harborfest], a four-day festival of music, culture and food, centered around the Oswego Harbor, culminating in a fireworks display on the Saturday evening of the festival. The event is sponsored by local businesses, and the entertainment is mostly admission-free. The festival continues to draw approximately 150,000 to 300,000 attendees every year.

In 2007, SUNY Oswego Lakers men's hockey team won the NCAA Division III Ice Hockey Championship. Garren Reisweber's goal 12:55 into overtime gave Oswego State a 4-3 win over Middlebury on March 18, 2007. The Lakers captured the school's first ever national championship in a team sport. The 2006-07 season marked the first season Oswego played in the newly built, state-of-the-art Campus Center, located on Lake Ontario. The Campus Center replaced Romney Field House which opened in 1964, and is believed to be the first ice rink built within the State University of New York system.

==Media==
The city is served by [http://www.pall-times.com/ The Palladium Times newspaper], [http://oswegocountytoday.com/ Oswego County Today], the student-run newspaper [http://www.oswegonian.com/ The Oswegonian], as well as [http://oswegonylion.com/ OswegoNYlion] and is the home to the radio stations [[WRVO]], [[WSGO]], [[WTKV]] (TK105), [[WNYO (FM)|WNYO]] and [[WMVU|WMVN]].  Oswego also has its own television station, [[WTOP-TV (SUNY Oswego)|WTOP]], which is completely student-run at the State University of New York at Oswego, and is served by the Oswego High School television station, WBUC. Oswego is served by the [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]] TV market. Previous media included the Oswego Daily

==Education==
The city is part of the [[Oswego City School District]]. The Oswego City School district has one [[Oswego High School (New York)|high school]] (grades 9 - 12), one middle school (grades 7 &amp; 8) and five elementary schools (grades K - 6). The [[State University of New York at Oswego]] (SUNY Oswego) is located just west of the city in the town of Oswego. Trinity Catholic School (formerly St. Paul's Academy) provides classes for PreK - 6. Oswego Community Christian School provides classes for Pre K - 8.

'''White Plains''' is a U.S. city in the state of [[:New York]]. It is the commercial hub and the [[county seat|seat]] of [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]], an affluent suburban county that is home to almost one million people, just north of [[New York City]]. White Plains is located in south-central Westchester, with its downtown about {{convert|7|mi|0}} east of the [[Hudson River]] and {{convert|7|mi|0}} northwest of [[Long Island Sound]]. It is bordered to the north by the town of [[North Castle, New York|North Castle]], to the north and east by the town/village of [[Harrison, New York|Harrison]], to the south by the town/village of [[Scarsdale, New York|Scarsdale]], and to the west by the town of [[Greenburgh, New York|Greenburgh]].

As of 2011, the city's total population was estimated to be 57,258, up from 56,853 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Census 2010&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_DP/G001/1600000US3681677| title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (G001): White Plains city, New York| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau, American Factfinder| accessdate=January 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the city government, the daytime weekday population is estimated at 250,000.&lt;ref&gt;Fernanda Santos, ''New York Times'': [http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/25/nyregion/25plains.html?fta=y Crimes in White Plains Decline to Record Lows], January 25, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Early history===
At the time of the Dutch settlement of [[Manhattan]] in the early 17th century, the region had been used as farmland by the Weckquaeskeck tribe, members of the [[Mohican]] nation and was called &quot;Quarropas&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odom&quot;&gt;Karen Odom, ''Westchester Magazine'': [http://www.westchestermagazine.com/Westchester-Magazine/November-2004/Welcome-Back-to-Whitse-Plains/ Welcome (Back) to White Plains], June 11, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; To early traders it was known as &quot;the White Plains&quot;, either from the groves of white balsam which are said to have covered it,&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'', Eleventh Edition (1911), Volume XXVIII, p. 607.&lt;/ref&gt; or from the heavy mist that local tradition suggests hovered over the swamplands near the [[Bronx River]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoffman&quot;&gt;Hoffman, Redona. ''Yesterday in White Plains, a Picture History of a Vanished Era'', Second Edition, Privately Published, 1984. Available from the White Plains, NY Public Library and other sources.&lt;/ref&gt; The first non-native settlement came in November 1683, when a party of [[Connecticut]] [[Puritans]] moved westward from an earlier settlement in [[Rye (city), New York|Rye]] and bought about {{convert|4400|acre|km2}}, presumably from the Weckquaeskeck.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odom&quot;/&gt; However, John Richbell of [[Mamaroneck (town), New York|Mamaroneck]] claimed to have earlier title to much of the territory through his purchase of a far larger plot extending {{convert|20|mi|km|0}} inland, perhaps from a different tribe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoffman&quot;/&gt; The matter wasn't settled until 1721, when a [[Land patent|Royal Patent]] for White Plains was granted by [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoffman&quot;/&gt;

In 1758, White Plains became the seat of Westchester County when the colonial government for the county left West Chester, which was located in what is now the northern part of the borough of the [[Bronx]], in New York City. The unincorporated village remained part of the Town of Rye until 1788, when the Town of White Plains was created.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoffman&quot;/&gt;

On July 9, 1776, a copy of the [[Declaration of Independence]] was delivered to the New York Provincial Congress, which was meeting in the county courthouse. The delegates quickly adopted a resolution approving the Declaration, thus declaring both the colony's independence and the formation of the [[State of New York]]. The Declaration itself was first publicly read from the steps of the courthouse on July 11.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoffman&quot;/&gt;

During September and October 1776, troops led by [[George Washington]] took up positions in the hills of the village, hotly pursued by the British under General [[Sir William Howe]], who attacked on October 28.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoffman&quot;/&gt; The [[Battle of White Plains]] took place primarily on Chatterton Hill, (later known as &quot;Battle Hill,&quot; and located just west of what was then a swamp but is now the downtown area) and the Bronx River. Howe's force of 4,000–6,000 British and [[Hessian (soldiers)|Hessian soldiers]] required three attacks before the Continentals, numbering about 1,600 under the command of Generals Alexander McDougall and Israel Putnam, retreated, joining Washington's main force, which did not take part in the battle. Howe's forces had suffered 250 casualties, a severe loss, and he made no attempt to pursue the Continentals, whose casualties were about 125 dead and wounded. Three days after the battle Washington withdrew north of the village, this was then occupied by Howe's forces. But after several inconclusive skirmishes over the next week Howe withdrew on November 5, leaving White Plains to the Continentals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoffman&quot;/&gt; Ironically, one of Washington's subordinates, Major John Austin, who was probably drunk after having celebrated the enemy's withdrawal, reentered the village with his detachment and proceeded to burn it down. Although he was court-martialed and convicted for this action, he escaped punishment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoffman&quot;/&gt;

The first [[United States Census]], conducted in 1790, listed the White Plains population at 505, of whom 46 were slaves.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoffman&quot;/&gt; (New York City's population at that time was about 33,000.) By 1800, the population stood at 575 and in 1830, 830.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoffman&quot;/&gt; By 1870, 26 years after the arrival of the [[New York Central Railroad]], it had swollen to 2,630&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoffman&quot;/&gt; and by 1890 to 4,508. In the decades that followed the count grew to 7,899 (1900) and 26,425 (1910).&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;/&gt; White Plains was incorporated as a village in 1866 and as a city in 1916.

===Modern history===
[[File:Main Street in the City of White Plains.JPG|thumb|342x342px|Main Street in the City of White Plains.]]
Early in the 20th century, White Plains' downtown area developed into a dominant suburban shopping district and featured branch stores of many famous New York-based department and specialty stores. Some of these retail locations were the first large-scale suburban stores built in the United States, and ushered in the eventual post-[[World War II]] building boom.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} With the construction of the parkways and expressways in the 1940s and 1960s, White Plains' role as a destination retail location was only enhanced. With a city opening ceremony Macy's launched a grand White Plains store on Main Street across from City Hall in 1949. As the mayor said at the time, this was a significant event in the life of White Plains. Other stores later followed such as [[B. Altman &amp; Co.]], Rogers Peet, [[Saks Fifth Avenue]], [[Alexander's]], Wallach's and a short-lived branch of [[Bergdorf Goodman]], which was later converted to sister chain, [[Neiman Marcus]], in 1981. White Plains is still a huge retail destination in the area with [[Bloomingdale's]], [[Neiman Marcus]], [[Nordstrom]], [[Nordstrom Rack]], [[Macy's]], [[Sears]], [[Burlington Coat Factory]], and over 1000 other small and mid-size stores in four malls.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

During the late 1960s, the city of White Plains developed an extensive urban renewal plan for residential, commercial and mixed-use redevelopment that effectively called for the demolition of its entire central business district from the [[Bronx River Parkway]] east to Mamaroneck Avenue. By 1978, the [[urban renewal]] program centered around the construction of the Westchester County Courthouse (1974), the Westchester One office building (1975), the [[Galleria at White Plains]] mall (1978), and a number of other office towers, retail centers and smaller commercial buildings.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

At the time of its construction, the Westchester One building was the largest office building between New York City and [[Albany, New York|Albany]], and east to [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

Beginning in the 1950s, many major corporations based in New York City relocated operations to White Plains and other nearby locations. These included [[General Foods]], [[PepsiCo]], [[Hitachi, Ltd.|Hitachi]] USA, [[IBM]], [[Nestlé]], [[Snapple]] and [[Heineken]] USA. At the height of the 1980s, at least 50 [[Fortune 500]] corporations called Westchester County and nearby Fairfield County, CT, home, but with the corporate mergers and downsizing of the 1990s many of these companies either reduced their operations in White Plains or left the area completely. 
[[File:New York Power Authority and Main Street in White Plains.JPG|thumb|343x343px|New York Power Authority and Main Street in White Plains]]
White Plains continues to attract regional and national business as well as international headquarters within it boundaries such as Nine West Group, Allegiance Financial, ITT Corporation, Nokia, Heineken USA, Alliance Bernstein, AT&amp;T and Verizon.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

White Plains is also home to the Arts Exchange Building, which serves as the headquarters of the Westchester Arts Council. Since March 1999, visual and performing artists, emerging cultural organizations and new creative businesses have studios and offices in the building. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The construction of the [[Galleria at White Plains]] mall in the 1970s ushered in a new era of downtown retail and office development, but by the early 1990s, economic development had stagnated, hampered by a deep recession and the overbuilding of the commercial real estate markets.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} For a time, White Plains had the dubious distinction of having one of the highest office vacancy rates in the Northeast. Consolidation within the retail industry led to the closing of many of downtown's original department and specialty stores as well. After its bankruptcy, the [[B. Altman]] store closed in 1989 and was eventually demolished to make way for the massive upscale retail mall, [[The Westchester]], which opened in 1995 with anchors [[Nordstrom]] and [[Neiman Marcus]]. A freestanding branch of [[Macy's]], one of downtown's original retail [[anchor store]]s, was relocated two blocks away to The Galleria mall by its parent company, [[Federated Department Stores]], replacing the location of sister retailer, [[Abraham &amp; Straus]] when these two store divisions were merged in 1995. 
[[File:City Center in the City of White Plains.JPG|thumb|344x344px|City Center on Mamaroneck Ave in White Plains]]
In early 2002, the [[Saks Fifth Avenue]] location was also closed and demolished; it was replaced in 2004 with the large retail complex called [[The Source at White Plains]], featuring the upscale restaurants [[Morton's of Chicago]], [[The Cheesecake Factory]], and the gourmet supermarket chain [[Whole Foods Markets]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Note: As of July 20, 2009, the Fortunoff and Mayrock families re-acquired the Fortunoff brand and intellectual property; all Fortunoff stores are currently closed.

Other major projects were completed in the late 1990s and early 2000s that have further altered the urban character of downtown White Plains. A new courthouse for the [[Southern District of New York]] was opened in 1998 and several large-scale office properties in and near downtown, including the former General Foods headquarters building, were retrofitted and leased to accommodate smaller businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B03E0D61031F935A2575AC0A96E958260 | work=The New York Times | title=Commercial Real Estate; General Foods' Old Office Is Repackaged for Multiple Tenants | first=David W. | last=Dunlap | date=September 16, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Macy's store on Main Street remained vacant for several years until it was also later demolished to make way for the massive [[City Center White Plains]] complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whiteplainscnr.com/old/frontpage/frontpage-0718.html |title=Front Page |publisher=Whiteplainscnr.com |date=July 17, 2001 |accessdate=April 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This large mixed-use development features [[Trump Tower (White Plains)|two 35-story apartment and condominium towers]], {{convert|600000|sqft|m2|-4|sing=on}} of retail, restaurant and entertainment space and new parking facilities. Aside from the Arts Exchange building (which used to be a bank), another bank next to the City Center was renovated to become [[Zanaro's]], a family-style Italian restaurant. In 2010, Zanaros closed and was replaced by [[Buffalo Wild Wings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://food.lohudblogs.com/2010/06/15/buffalo-wild-wings-going-into-the-old-zanaros-space-in-white-plains| title=Buffalo Wild Wings Going into Old Zanaros Space in White Plains}}&lt;/ref&gt; City Center's opening in 2003 marked the beginning of a new downtown development renaissance, and with the improving economy and healthy office leasing activity, White Plains entered the new millennium as the leading retail and office center in Westchester County.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

In 2005, construction began on a second large parcel in the downtown area. The project, known as Renaissance Square, features two residential and hotel towers, each 40 stories tall, features a luxury [[Ritz-Carlton]] hotel and more than 400 condominium units. The Ritz-Carlton Westchester is one of the tallest buildings between New York City and Boston, exceeded only by City Place in Hartford.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

Beginning in 2000, the city's permanent population experienced a growth spurt as additional apartment buildings were constructed. The city's relatively moderate housing costs and close commuting distance to midtown Manhattan (31 minutes by express train&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://as0.mta.info/mnr/schedules/ |title=Welcome To VTTS |publisher=As0.mta.info |accessdate=April 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;) have also attracted a lot of people who commute to New York City for work. However, in large part because of its proximity to New York, the cost of living in White Plains, although lower than that of New York City itself, is by some measures among the highest in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/top-50-cities/2006/06/26/1151174117013.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Top 50 cities | date=June 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fire Department==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2013}}
The City of White Plains is protected by the 140 paid firefighters of the city of White Plains Fire Department(WPFD). The department is currently the 7th largest fire department in the state of New York and operates out of 5 Fire Stations, located throughout the city, under the command of a Deputy Chief per shift. The WPFD operates a fire apparatus fleet of 5 Engines, 3 Ladders, 1 Rescue, 1 Squad(Cross-staffed), 1 Squad Support Unit, 1 Mini-Attack Parking Garage Unit, and numerous other special, support, and reserve units. The WPFD responds to, on average, approximately 7,000 emergency calls annually. Also, the WPFD has been recently labeled as an ISO Class 1 fire department, making it one of only 5 of its kind in the Northeastern United States. Being a Class 1 fire department means that the WPFD provides the maximum amount of fire protection to the area it serves, thus lowering property, home and commercial insurance rates for the city's residents and business owners.

===Public schools===
The [[White Plains Public School System]], with a 2006 enrollment of over 6,000 pupils, maintains five elementary schools (grades K-5), two middle schools (6–8) and one high school (9–12), as well as auxiliary facilities including a pre-kindergarten program,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whiteplainspublicschools.org/41129472144543/blank/browse.asp?a=383&amp;BMDRN=2000&amp;BCOB=0&amp;c=49767 |title=Strategic Plan |publisher=White Plains Public Schools |accessdate=April 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; a community school (grades 7–12),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whiteplainspublicschools.org/41129472144543/blank/browse.asp?a=383&amp;BMDRN=2000&amp;BCOB=0&amp;c=49769 |title=Strategic Plan |publisher=White Plains Public Schools |accessdate=April 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; adult and continuing education,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whiteplainspublicschools.org/41129472144543/blank/browse.asp?a=383&amp;BMDRN=2000&amp;BCOB=0&amp;c=49766 |title=Strategic Plan |publisher=White Plains Public Schools |accessdate=April 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whiteplainspublicschools.org/41129472144543/blank/browse.asp?A=383&amp;BMDRN=2000&amp;BCOB=0&amp;C=49862 |title=Strategic Plan |publisher=White Plains Public Schools |accessdate=April 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; for school-age patients at [[New York-Presbyterian Hospital]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nyp.org&lt;/ref&gt; which campus is located in the city.

Since 1988 the district has operated under a Controlled Parents' Choice Program,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wpcsd.k12.ny.us/41129472144330/site/default.asp ]{{dead link|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereby the parents of elementary and middle school children can select the school which their child attends based on factors other than proximity to the school.

The five elementary schools, and to a lesser extent, the two middle schools, in addition to teaching core competencies, have different educational focuses including science &amp; technology, communication arts and global understanding. The primary distinction between the two middle schools is the number of pupils enrolled. The smaller &quot;Eastview&quot; Campus has about 1/3 the number of students as the &quot;Highlands&quot; campus. There are about 1100 students at Highlands and only about 400 at Eastview.

[[White Plains Senior High School]], built in the late 1950s on a {{convert|72|acre|sing=on}} campus, serves all public school students in grades 9–12.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whiteplainspublicschools.org/wphs/site/default.asp |title=White Plains High School |publisher=Whiteplainspublicschools.org |accessdate=April 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school has a swimming pool that overlooks a small valley which included the track and football field. The White Plains Recreation Department worked in cooperation with the schools to offer many programs.

The district is governed by a seven-member Board of Education, elected at-large for staggered three-year terms. A school superintendent reports to the Board.

==Transportation==

===Highways===
[[File:Westchester County Airport.jpg|thumb|[[Westchester County Airport]]|358x358px]]
The [[Cross-Westchester Expressway]], or [[Interstate 287|I-287]], runs east to [[Rye (city), New York|Rye]] where it meets [[Interstate 95|I-95]], the major route along the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]], and west across the [[Hudson River]] via the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]], linking White Plains to [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]], points [[Upstate New York|upstate]], and parts of northern [[New Jersey]]. Current highway works include pedestrian walkways over the highway, an extra lane on either side, and on/off ramps to help motor traffic and pedestrians. Vegetation removals have upset some in the community but it is reported that the area will be fixed and trees will be replanted when work on the highway comes to an end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.i287.info/ |title=New York State Department of Transportation – I287 Highway / Cross Westchester Expressway Project |publisher=I287.info |accessdate=April 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bronx River Parkway]], which runs north-south through White Plains, provides access to New York City and areas in northern Westchester, such as [[Chappaqua, New York|Chappaqua]] and [[Yorktown Heights, New York|Yorktown Heights]].

===Air===
[[Westchester County Airport]] is located in [[Harrison, New York|Harrison]], about {{convert|7|mi|km}} northeast of Downtown White Plains.

In addition, JetBlue began service from Westchester to [[Lynden Pindling International Airport|Nassau, Bahamas]] in November 2011. Many people instead opt to fly out of one of New York City's three major airports, two of which are located within an hour's drive of White Plains.

'''Saratoga Springs''', also known as simply '''Saratoga''' (though not to be confused with the [[Saratoga, New York|nearby town of that name]]), is a [[Administrative divisions of New York#City|city]] in [[Saratoga County, New York|Saratoga County]], [[New York]], [[United States]]. The population was 26,586 at the [[United States Census 2010|2010 census]].{{GR|2}} The name reflects the presence of [[spring (hydrosphere)|mineral springs]] in the area. While the word &quot;Saratoga&quot; is known to be a corruption of a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] name, authorities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first =Willys | last =Peck | title =Saratoga Stereopticon | url =http://mytown.mercurynews.com/archives/saratoganews/04.29.98/SaratogaStereopticon.html | publisher =Silicon Valley Community Newspapers |date=1998-04-29 | accessdate =2007-03-20 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; disagree on the original term and its meaning. The city is near the center of [[Saratoga County, New York|Saratoga County]] in [[upstate New York]].

==History==
{{Refimprove section|date=September 2012}}
The area was occupied by the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]-speaking [[Mahican]] Indians before they were pushed out by European settlement, both Dutch and English colonists. They eventually moved east and became allied with other remnant peoples and became known as the [[Stockbridge Indians]], as they settled near [[Stockbridge, Massachusetts]].

The English built Fort Saratoga in 1691 on the west bank of the Hudson River. The current village of [[Schuylerville, New York]] was settled about a mile south by English colonists shortly after the fort; it was known as Saratoga until 1831. In 1767, [[Sir William Johnson, 1st Baronet|William Johnson]], a British soldier who was a hero of the [[French and Indian War]]s, was brought by Native American friends to springs about 10 miles (16&amp;nbsp;km) west of the village. They treated his war wounds, as the  spring was thought to have medicinal properties. Now known as High Rock Spring, it may still be visited today. In 1756 Johnson had been appointed British Superintendent of Indian Affairs in the Northeast region due to his success in building alliances with the [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]] and other [[Iroquois]] tribes. He had learned the language, and created many trading relationships. He achieved great wealth from trading and landholdings, and was knighted for his service to the Crown with the Iroquois.

The first permanent European-American settler built a dwelling about 1776. The springs attracted tourists, and [[Gideon Putnam]] built the first hotel for travelers. Putnam also laid out the roads and donated land for use as public spaces.

The [[Battle of Saratoga]], the turning point of the [[Revolutionary War]], did not take place in Saratoga Springs. Rather, the battlefield is {{convert|15|mi|km}} to the southeast in the Town of [[Stillwater (town), New York|Stillwater]]. A museum dedicated to the two battles is located on the fields where the battles were fought. The British encampment before the surrender at Saratoga took place {{convert|10|mi|km}} east of the city, in [[Schuylerville, New York|Schuylerville]], where several historical markers delineate points of interest. The surrender of the sword of battle took place where Fort Saratoga had been, south of Schuylerville.

Saratoga Springs was established as a settlement in 1819 from a western portion of the [[Saratoga, New York|Town of Saratoga]]. Its principal community was incorporated as a village in 1826 and the entire region became a city in 1915. Tourism was greatly aided after 1832 by the arrival of the [[Saratoga and Schenectady Railroad]], which brought thousands of travelers to the famous mineral springs. Resort hotels developed to accommodate them. Patronage of the railroad increased steadily after the [[Delaware and Hudson Canal Company]] assumed control in 1870 and began running the [[Empire State Express]] directly between [[New York City]] and the resort.

In the 19th century, the noted doctor [[Simon Baruch]] encouraged developing European-style [[spas]] in the United States as centers for health. With its wealth of mineral waters, Saratoga Springs was developed as a [[Spa town|spa]], generating the development of many large hotels, including the United States Hotel and the [[Grand Union Hotel (Saratoga Springs, New York)|Grand Union Hotel]]. The latter was, in its day, the largest hotel in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/17633/17633-h/17633-h.htm R. F. Dearborn, ''Saratoga and How to See It'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1863, [[Saratoga Race Course]] opened, moving to its current location the following year. Horse racing and its associated betting greatly increased the city's attraction as a tourist destination at a time when horse racing was a popular national spectator sport. In addition, the Saratoga Springs area was known for its gambling, which after the first years of the 20th century was illegal, but still widespread. Most gambling facilities were located on Saratoga Lake, on the southeast side of the city.

After the closing and demolition in the 1940s and 1950s of many of the town's premier hotels, including the Grand Union and United States, and competition from other destinations as more people used cars to travel widely for vacations, Saratoga Springs suffered a significant economic downturn.  During the 1950s, the state and city finally closed the famed gambling houses, which further damaged Saratoga Springs as a destination.

The city's rebirth began in the 1960s with the completion of the Adirondack Northway (Interstate 87), which allowed visitors from the north and south much easier access. In addition, the construction of the Saratoga Performing Arts Center in the late 1960s, which features classical and popular music and dance, furthered the city's renaissance. The New York City Ballet performed there for numerous summer seasons, together with other high-quality dance groups and musicians. In the early 21st century, there has been a boom of building, both residential and retail, in the west side and downtown areas of the city.

==Geography==
Saratoga Springs is located at {{Coord|43.075337|-73.782422|type:city_region:US|format=dms|display=inline}} (43.075337, -73.782422).{{GR|1}}

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|29.1|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|28.4|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|0.6|sqmi|km2}} (2.17%) is water.

The Adirondack Northway ([[Interstate 87]]) and [[U.S. Route 9 in New York|US Route 9]] pass alongside and through the city, respectively. [[New York State Route 29]], [[New York State Route 50]], [[New York State Route 9N]], and [[New York State Route 9P]] lead into Saratoga Springs.

[[Saratoga Lake]] is southeast of the city.

The city is one of only three in the state of New York to have a three-tier tax district system, the inside district being what was originally the [[Administrative divisions of New York#Village|village]] of Saratoga Springs, and the outside district being the [[Administrative divisions of New York#Town|town]] of Saratoga Springs minus the village. The other two cities with three-tier tax system are [[Rome, New York]] and [[Oneida, New York]].

==Transportation==
{{See also|Saratoga Springs (Amtrak station)}}
The closest scheduled air service is available at [[Albany International Airport|Albany International Airport (ALB)]].  There is also a general aviation facility, [[Saratoga County Airport|Saratoga County Airport (5B2)]], located west of city limits in the [[Milton (town), New York|Town of Milton]].

[[Amtrak]], the national passenger rail system, provides service to Saratoga Springs, operating its [[Adirondack (Amtrak)|Adirondack]] daily in both directions between [[Central Station (Montreal)|Central Station]] in [[Montreal]] and [[Penn Station (New York)|Penn Station]] in [[New York City]] and the [[Ethan Allen Express]] daily in both directions between [[Rutland (Amtrak station)|Rutland, Vermont]] and New York City.  The local station off of West Avenue was built in 1956, but dramatically rehabilitated in 2004.  The {{convert|6400|sqft|m2|adj=on}} passenger area contains a coffee shop/newsstand, murals, an [[automated teller machine]], a visitors information kiosk, an outside patio area with benches, and a children’s play area.  The station serves about 23,000 passengers every year.

[[Greyhound Bus Lines]] also serves the city frequently, sending buses every few hours towards [[Albany, New York|Albany]] or Montreal.  The city Amtrak station serves as the Greyhound Bus Lines and Adirondack Trailways Bus Lines station.  The city is also served by the [[Capital District Transportation Authority]], which provides bus service from [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]] via [[New York State Route 50|Route 50]] daily, and weekday service to Albany via the Northway Express line.

Long-distance motorists generally reach Saratoga via [[Interstate 87]], which north of Albany is known as the Adirondack Northway.  Three exits access the city.  Exit 13-S is optimal for reaching Saratoga Lake, and 13-N for the Saratoga Performing Arts Center (SPAC) and the southern and western quadrants of the city.  Visitors to the Saratoga Race Course use Exit 14, which is also arguably best for reaching downtown from the south.  Exit 15 serves [[Skidmore College]], downtown if coming from the north, and the shopping malls just north of city limits.

==Business==
Though Saratoga Springs relies heavily on tourism as its main source of income, especially during the summer months while [[Saratoga Race Course]] is open, there is plenty of industry that keeps this culture-rich city's economy booming, and some residents commute to the Albany area. Saratoga Springs is home to a plant of [[Quad Graphics]], offset printers of [[Time Magazine]], [[Newsweek]], [[People Magazine]], [[Sports Illustrated]] and many others.  [[Ball Corporation]], makers of the Mason Jar as well as aluminum cans for companies such as [[Pepsi]] and [[Anheuser-Busch InBev]], has a large manufacturing plant in the city. [[Stewart's Shops]], a popular convenience store chain that is an employee- and family-owned business dealing in milk, ice cream, coffee, food to go, gasoline, and more is based out of Saratoga Springs.  Stewart's now has over 300 stores throughout New York and Vermont. The Saratoga Spring Water Co. (a division of [[Anheuser-Busch InBev]]) on Geyser Road has been in operation since 1872.

===Horse racing===
The city is perhaps best known for the [[Saratoga Race Course]], which opened on August 3, 1863. The first track was located across Union Avenue (at the present Oklahoma Training Track location) from the present Saratoga Race Course, which opened the following year.  Founded by John Hunter and [[William R. Travers]], the [[thoroughbred]] track is the oldest continuously-operating sporting event of any kind in the United States.  The track holds a summer meet lasting six weeks, from late July to Labor Day, that attracts the top horses, jockeys, and trainers in America. The meet features a number of major stakes races, with the [[Travers Stakes]], a Grade I race, being the most important of America's summer horse races. The track season sees a dramatic influx of people into the city.  Hotels fill to capacity, and many Saratogians rent out their homes.

Also located in the city is the [[Saratoga Casino and Raceway]], a harness ([[Standardbred horse|Standardbred]]) racetrack that includes a video gaming facility, the Racino, and a horse betting simulcast room.

===The Springs===
[[File:SaratogaSpringwater.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Columbian Spring, one of Saratoga's many public springs]]
Before racing began in Saratoga, the area's natural mineral springs had been attracting summertime visitors for many decades.  The springs occur on a line where the north-south Saratoga Fault allows water trapped in subsurface shale layers to reach the surface.

Believed to have healing powers, springs can be found all over town. Most of the springs are covered by small pavilions and marked by plaques; others, however, are less conspicuous, sometimes just a spigot in a rock. The springs are famous for their varied and distinct tastes: some are clear freshwater, others are saltier, and some taste strongly of a certain mineral such as sodium bicarbonate or sodium chloride. There is a sulfur odor, but mineral analysis of the water consistently shows almost no presence of dissolved sulfur. The sulfur is in the form of the gas [[hydrogen sulfide]], which degasses from the water very quickly. Visitors are welcome to bottle the spring water for personal consumption.

Toward the end of the nineteenth century excessive pumping for commercial bottling was threatening to deplete the springs.  In 1911 the New York State Reservation, now the Spa State Park, was created to protect the springs and the Lincoln and Roosevelt bath houses were built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Saratoga Springs Heritage Area Visitor Center|title=History of Saratoga|url=http://www.saratogaspringsvisitorcenter.com/about-saratoga-springs/history-of-saratoga|accessdate=May 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Currently spa treatments are available in the Roosevelt Baths.

===Skateboard park===
[[File:Saratoga skatepark.jpg|thumb|skateboarder skating the skateboard pool at Saratoga Springs Skatepark in New York State]]
The Saratoga Springs Skatepark (est. 1988), located in the center of the East Side Recreation area on Lake Avenue, is New York State's first municipal [[skatepark]]. The exercise facility is known for its cement [[skateboard]] pool, installed with a state-of-the-art design in 2004 which the city filled with dirt in March 2010. The city's reasons cited for filling the &quot;bowl&quot; with dirt were graffiti, vandalism and unconfirmed structural issues which they claimed affected the skating surface. In addition, the city lacked funds to staff guards at the park and claimed it had spent nearly $200,000 on the park since it opened in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Donges|first=Patrick|title=Skateboarding bowl filled at Saratoga Springs' East Side Rec|url=http://www.saratogian.com/articles/2010/03/24/news/doc4ba96e2739c12324536682.txt|accessdate=23 April 2013|newspaper=The Saratogian|date=24 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a group of skateboarders lobbied the city then publicly offered to dig out the pool by hand, the city excavated it in November 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jenks|first=Eric|title=Photos: Saratoga Springs' East Side Rec skate bowl reopens|url=http://www.saratogian.com/articles/2011/11/05/news/doc4eb5f59895679978649551.txt|accessdate=23 April 2013|newspaper=The Saratogian|date=5 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Yusko|first=Dennis|title=Skateboarder's moves may hit pay dirt|url=http://www.timesunion.com/local/article/Skateboarder-s-moves-may-hit-pay-dirt-2228998.php|accessdate=23 April 2013|newspaper=The Times Union|date=20 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The skatepark is now free, open to the public and endorses a skate-at-your-own-risk policy per the [http://asci.uvm.edu/equine/law/recreate/ny_rec.htm New York Recreational Use Statute].

===Arts and entertainment===
[[File:Horse6.jpg|thumb|left|215px|Superhorse, one of 34 fiberglass horses on display around downtown Saratoga Springs in the 2007 ''Horses, Saratoga Style'' exhibit of public art]]

The [[Saratoga Performing Arts Center]] (known by its acronym &quot;SPAC,&quot; which rhymes with &quot;snack&quot;) is a covered outdoor amphitheater located on the grounds of the [[Saratoga Spa State Park]], with a capacity of 5,000 in reserved seating and 20,000+ on its general admission lawn area.  SPAC is the summer home of the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]] and the [[New York City Ballet]], and has hosted a weekend-long jazz festival since 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McGuire|first=Mark|title=The first Saratoga Jazz Fest|url=http://www.timesunion.com/entertainment/article/The-first-Saratoga-Jazz-Fest-3667031.php|accessdate=23 April 2013|newspaper=The Times Union|date=27 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2006, the Saratoga Native American Festival has been held on SPAC grounds each fall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Willman|first=Dale|title=Native American Festival Continues at SPAC: Photo Essay|url=http://www.saratogawire.com/article/290/120930-native-american-festival-spac-bruchac|accessdate=23 April 2013|newspaper=Saratoga Wire|date=30 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  SPAC is a stop for touring national recording artists:  over 20 popular bands grace the stage every summer.  Steps away on State Park grounds, the [[Spa Little Theater]] hosts the &quot;Home Made Theater&quot; as well as [[Opera Saratoga]] (formerly known as the Lake George Opera) during the summer.

[[Museum]]s in the area include the [[National Museum of Dance|National Museum of Dance and Hall of Fame]], the [[National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame]], and the [[Saratoga Automobile Museum]]. There are more than 20 [[golf course]]s in the area.

The city is notable for its vibrant night life. [[Caffè Lena]] was one of the first venues in the Eastern US at which [[Bob Dylan]] performed in 1961. [[Arlo Guthrie]] played at Caffè Lena early in his career and has returned for occasional benefit concerts, and the singer [[Don McLean]] was a frequent performer there early in his career. (Contrary to a popular legend, Mr. McLean has stated that his song &quot;[[American Pie (song)|American Pie]]&quot; was ''not'' composed at a table in the Tin &amp; Lint, a bar on Caroline Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dimopoulos|first=Thomas|title=Bye, bye local legend: Don McLean refutes tale of song's origin|url=http://poststar.com/news/local/bye-bye-local-legend-don-mclean-refutes-tale-of-song/article_fca88f04-18a8-11e1-bb02-001cc4c03286.html|accessdate=23 April 2013|newspaper=The Post Star|date=26 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Numerous other establishments are located on Broadway, Caroline Street (the Hamilton district), and the redeveloped Putnam Street.

Recently, Beekman Street (four blocks West of Broadway), once the center of a working-class residential neighborhood, has become an art district, housing four galleries, a restaurant, a pub and teahouse, and a bistro. Artists live and work in co-ops and arrange social events.  While some take credit for &quot;revitalizing&quot; a &quot;deteriorating&quot; area, others consider such declarations an insult to the generations of minority and marginalized ethnicities who worked in the service jobs of the tourism economy, and were traditionally [[Residential segregation|segregated]] to this once-remote quarter.

Saratoga Springs is home to [[Yaddo]], a {{convert|400|acre|km2 sqmi|2|adj=on}} artists' community, founded by Wall Street financier [[Spencer Trask]] and his wife, author [[Katrina Trask]]. Since its inception in 1900, Yaddo has hosted 68  authors who later won the [[Pulitzer Prize]] and one [[Nobel Prize]] winner, [[Saul Bellow]].  [[Leonard Bernstein]], [[Truman Capote]], [[Aaron Copland]], [[Sylvia Plath]], and [[David Sedaris]] have all been artists-in-residence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://yaddo.org/yaddo/history.shtml|publisher=Yaddo|accessdate=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Yaddo grounds are adjacent to the backstretch of the Saratoga Race Course.

'''Mount Vernon''' is a [[City (New York)|city]] in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]], [[New York]], [[United States]]. It lies on the border of the [[New York City]] [[Borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[the Bronx]]. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], Mount Vernon had a population of 67,292.&lt;ref name=&quot;Census 2010&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_DP/G001/1600000US3649121| title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (G001): Mount Vernon city, New York| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau, American Factfinder| accessdate=January 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
{{Refimprove section|date=September 2008}}
Mount Vernon is the eighth most populous city in the state of New York. It is a predominantly [[African-American]] city in a majority [[White American|White]] county. Northside Mount Vernon has a [[suburban]] look while Southside Mount Vernon has a very urban feel, nearly mirroring its border with the [[New York City]] borough, [[The Bronx]]. In fact, in 1894, the voters of Mount Vernon were able to take part, along with the voters of Kings, Queens and Richmond Counties, in a referendum to determine if they wanted to become part of a &quot;Greater New York City&quot;. While the results were positive elsewhere, the returns were so negative in Mount Vernon and [[Yonkers, New York|Yonkers]] that those two areas were not included in the consolidated city, and remained independent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite inside}}, p.177-78&lt;/ref&gt;

The city's downtown business district is also located on the city's south side, which features the City Hall, Office buildings, and other [[municipal]] establishments.  Mount Vernon was named after the [[Virginia]] plantation where [[George Washington]] spent his final years, just as neighboring [[Wakefield, Bronx|Wakefield]] was named after the plantation where he was born. However, the name Mt. Vernon precedes Washington. It was founded in the 17th Century by Anne Hutchinson and named for it's green mount (i.e. Mount Vernon.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Cohen |first=Joyce |title=If You're Thinking of Living In / Wakefield, the Bronx; Hugging Westchester At the Subway's End |newspaper=The New York Times |date=January 31, 1999 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/31/realestate/if-you-re-thinking-living-wakefield-bronx-hugging-westchester-subway-s-end.html |accessdate=2009-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mount Vernon has in recent years undergone a transition from a city of homes and small businesses to a city of regional commerce. Between 2000 and 2006, the city of Mount Vernon's economy grew 20.5%, making it one of the fastest growing cities in the metropolitan area of New York. Mount Vernon is often considered a poster child for cities within the county for having such a large magnitude of diversity for a city of its size.{{Who|date=September 2008}}

During the 1960s, Mount Vernon was a divided city on the brink of a &quot;northern style&quot; segregation. Many blacks from the [[Southern United States|South]] came to the north and settled in the city of Mount Vernon for better job opportunities and educational advancements. At the same time, many [[White American]]s from the [[Bronx]] and [[Manhattan]] looked to Mount Vernon as a new &quot;bedroom community&quot; due to rising crime in [[New York City]] (a &quot;[[white flight]]&quot; factor entailed as well). As a result, Mount Vernon became divided by the [[New Haven Line]] railroad tracks of the [[Metro North]] railroad into two parts north and south. The population of the &quot;South Side&quot; of the tracks became predominantly African American while the &quot;North Side&quot; of the tracks was largely white. 

At the height of this &quot;segregation&quot; in the 1970s August Petrillo was Mayor; when he died, Thomas E. Sharpe was elected Mayor. Upon Sharpe's death in 1984, Carmella Iaboni took office as &quot;acting-Mayor&quot; until [[Ronald Blackwood]] was elected. Mr. Blackwood was the first [[Afro-Caribbean American|Afro-Caribbean]] mayor of the city (as well as of any city in New York State). In 1996, Ernest D. Davis was elected the mayor of Mount Vernon. He served in office until 2007. Clinton I. Young, Jr. became the city's mayor on January 1, 2008. Four years later, on Sunday, January 1, 2012, Ernest D. Davis became the 21st Mayor of Mount Vernon after winning his re election from Clinton I. Young, Jr. Mr. Davis is currently under investigation for failure to report rental income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lohud.com/article/20130213/NEWS/302130069/Feds-investigate-Mount-Vernon-Mayor-Ernest-Davis-finances|title=Feds investigate Mount Vernon Mayor Ernest Davis' finances|date=Feb 13, 2013|newspaper=The Journal News|author=Jonathan Bandler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mount Vernon Public Library, a gift to the city from philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, opened in 1904 and is now Westchester's Central Library, providing educational, cultural and computer services to County residents of all ages.

The [[First United Methodist Church (Mount Vernon, New York)|First United Methodist Church]], [[Trinity Episcopal Church Complex (Mount Vernon, New York)|Trinity Episcopal Church Complex]], [[John Stevens House]], and [[United States Post Office (Mount Vernon, New York)|United States Post Office]] are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. The [[St. Paul's Church National Historic Site]] is listed as a [[National Historic Sites (United States)|National Historic Site]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nris&quot;&gt;{{NRISref|version=2009a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the election held on November 3, 2009, Maureen Walker was re-elected for a fourth term as Comptroller. She ran unopposed. Democrats Yuhanna Edwards, Karen Watts and Roberta Apuzzo won election to four-year council terms and Diane Munro was elected to fill a term that expires in two years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.topix.com/city/mount-vernon-ny/2009/11/mount-vernon-democrats-keep-majority-on-council ''Mount Vernon Democrats keep majority on council''], from LoHud.Com, date November 4, 2009 {{WebCite|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5uyTNVGH9|date =2010-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
[[File:Corner of Gramatan and Grand in Fleetwood October 2012.jpg|thumb|The corner of Gramatan and 
Grand Avenues in Fleetwood]]

===Location===
Mount Vernon is located at {{Coord|40.914060|-73.830507|type:city_region:US|format=dms|display=inline}} (40.914060, -73.830507).{{Geographic reference|1}} It is the third largest and the most densely populated city in Westchester County. According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|11.4|km2|disp=flip}}, of which {{convert|0.04|sqkm|disp=flip}}, or 0.39%, is water.&lt;ref name=&quot;Census 2010&quot;/&gt;

Mount Vernon is bordered by the village of [[Bronxville, New York|Bronxville]] and city of [[New Rochelle, New York|New Rochelle]] to the north, by the town of [[Pelham, New York|Pelham]] and city of [[Pelham Manor, New York|Pelham Manor]] to the east, by the [[Hutchinson River]] and New York City's [[Bronx, New York|Bronx]] borough to the south, and by the city of [[Yonkers, New York|Yonkers]] and the [[Bronx River]] to the west.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

===Elevation===
Mount Vernon's elevation at City Hall is about {{convert|235|ft|m}}, reflecting its location between the [[Bronx River]] to the west and the [[Hutchinson River]] to the east. From many parts of the city, the [[Throgs Neck Bridge]] can be seen from {{convert|10|mi|km|-1}} away on a clear day and at night the bridge lights can be seen. The City's seal, created in 1892, depicted what were then considered the highest points in Mount Vernon: Trinity Place near Fourth Street, Vista Place at Barnes Avenue, and North 10th Street between Washington and Jefferson places. Since then, it was discovered that the city's highest elevation is on [[New York Route 22]], North Columbus Avenue, at the [[Bronxville]] line.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

===Neighborhoods===
[[File:MountVernonNeighborhood.PNG|thumb|upright|Map of Mount Vernon's neighborhoods]]
[[File:Church at the Circle MV jeh.JPG|thumb|The Circle at Lincoln and Gramatan Avenues]]
Mount Vernon is typically thought to be divided into four major sections in four square miles: Downtown, Mount Vernon Heights, North Side, and South Side.

====Downtown====
Downtown Mount Vernon features the Gramatan Avenue and Fourth Avenue shopping district (known as &quot;The Avenue&quot; by locals{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}) and the Petrillo Plaza transit hub, and houses the city's central government.

Downtown is currently in the same condition it was 40 years ago. It features the same mid-century architecture and format, little changed, and struggles to keep up with the surrounding community's rapid development. Former mayor Clinton Young had vowed to make Mount Vernon a new [[epicenter]] with a new central business district. His plans included establishing commercial office space and rezoning to allow high density development in the downtown, as well as affordable and market rate housing.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

====Mount Vernon Heights====
Mount Vernon Heights' highly elevated terrain has earned the moniker &quot;The rolling hills of homes&quot;{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}. It is home to the city's commercial corridor, along Sandford Boulevard (6th Street).

Sandford Blvd (6th Street)—also known as &quot;Sandford Square&quot;—is a certified commercial corridor, which anchors businesses such as [[Bed Bath &amp; Beyond]], [[Best Buy]], Colonial Plaza (a strip mall), [[Famous Footwear]], Hooperstown, [[Petco]], [[Restaurant Depot]], [[Staples Inc.|Staples]], [[Stop and Shop]], and [[Target Corporation|Target]]. Sandford Square attracts residents from Mount Vernon, nearby communities in Westchester County and the Bronx, and shoppers from as far away as Connecticut via the [[Merrit Parkway]] and I-95, which merge onto the [[Hutchinson River Parkway]].{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} 

Most of the commercial development in this corridor has occurred since the 1980s. The area is still undergoing revitalization to encourage economic development within this {{convert|400|acre|km2|adj=on}} of land situated along and around the boulevard.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

====North Side====
[[File:Fleetwood Neighborhood Association Welcom Sign 2012.jpg|thumb|left|Fleetwood Welcome Sign]]Mount Vernon's North Side is one of the most ethnically diverse neighborhoods in Westchester County. The northern part of the city consists of five neighborhoods: Chester Heights, Estate Manor/Aubyn Estates, Fleetwood, Huntswood, and Oakwood Heights. In Fleetwood, many large co-op buildings line the center of town, which is bisected by Gramatan Avenue. The Huntswood and Estates sections are more affluent areas situated on the border between Mount Vernon and the Village of [[Bronxville]], with property values ranging from high $400,000 to millions of dollars for single houses.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

====South Side====
Mount Vernon's South Side, which abuts the [[Bronx, New York|The Bronx]], resembles [[New York City]] and includes the neighborhoods Parkside and Southside. Numerous industrial businesses are located in Parkside, while the rest of Southside Mount Vernon features multi-family homes, apartment buildings, commercial businesses and housing projects.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

South Side Mount Vernon features notable city landmarks such as Brush Park, Hutchinson Field, the [[Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America|Boys and Girls Club]], and [[St. Paul's Church National Historic Site]]. NBA basketball player [[Ben Gordon (basketball)|Ben Gordon]], who is from the South Side, has dedicated two playgrounds to the city: one on South Eighth Avenue, and the other at the Mount Vernon [[YMCA]] Family Center.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

==Economy==
Mount Vernon's three major employers are the Mount Vernon city school district with (1,021 employees), Michael Anthony Jewelers (712 employees), and Mount Vernon Hospital (700 employees).{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Mount Vernon has a large [[commerce|commercial]] sector which boosts the city's economy, with industries such as [[electronics]], [[engineering]], [[high tech]], historical metal restoration, and [[manufacturing]] mainly located in the Southside section of the city. For example, the city is home to the headquarters of Capri Album Inc., Clickable Enterprises Inc., Spl Integrated Solutions' northeast branch, Unitex, Zelco Industries Inc., and Metal Man Restoration LLC, noted for completing historical restoration projects at the [[Smithsonian Institute]], [[New York City Hall]], [[Madison Square Garden]], [[Yankee Stadium]], and several [[custom house]]s in [[Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House|New York City]] and [[United States Custom House (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania)|Philadelphia]].{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Columbus Construction Co., located in Mount Vernon's South Side, helped at [[Ground Zero]] during the [[World Trade Center]] cleanup in [[Lower Manhattan]].

Mount Vernon also has an established [[Empire Zone]] for commercial and industrial use, located in the southern portion of the city, which has attracted manufacturing companies and nationally recognized businesses for major retailers and companies such as:

====Brazilian community====
The 2000 [[census]]{{Geographic reference|2}} reports that a significant proportion of the population is of [[Brazilian people|Brazilian]] descent; Brazilians can be included in the [[African American]], [[white people|White]], [[Multiracial]] and/or [[Latino]] categories. Estimates by the City of Mount Vernon and the Brazilian Consulate in New York indicate one in 10 people in Mount Vernon is from Brazil and two-thirds of those Brazilians are from [[Poços de Caldas]].&lt;ref name = NYTBrOutWestch&gt;&quot;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/26/nyregion/26brazil.html|title= A Brazilian Outpost in Westchester County|journal=The New York Times|date=26 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Brazilian community is heavily concentrated in an area along and near West Lincoln Avenue, from its beginning at the corner of Mt. Vernon Avenue, going about half a mile down to Gramatan Avenue (N. Fourth Avenue), and has begun to expand into East Lincoln Avenue. Brazilian stores line commercial areas in these parts of Mount Vernon [especially within Gramatan Avenue (North Fourth Avenue), from the railroad tracks to Lincoln Avenue and adjacent blocks], and neighborhood public schools have brought in teachers and counselors who speak Portuguese. The language can be heard on the streets throughout this area.

The Brazilians living in Mount Vernon have also transformed their Brazilian hometown, pumping millions of dollars into its economy and helping to pay for new homes and businesses there. So important are these [[remittance]]s that Brazilian journalist Walther Alvarenga has made Mount Vernon the focus of a series of documentaries for Brazilian public television called ''New York, O Sonho Brasileiro'' (''New York, the Brazilian Dream'').

In November 2005, Mayor Ernest D. Davis traveled to Poços de Caldas to sign a sister-city agreement to strengthen the bond between the two cities.&lt;ref name = NYTBrOutWestch /&gt;

[[Westchester Community College]] has an extension site education facility, downtown.

In 2011, ''[[The Journal News]]'' featured an article titled &quot;Region's Aging Schools Crumble as Finances Falter&quot;, by Cathey O'Donnell and Gary Stern. The article discussed several old school buildings within the region that were in disrepair, how much it would cost to fix them, and which if any might need to be demolished. The Mount Vernon school district was included in the article, which stated:

:&quot;In Mount Vernon, meanwhile, where a high school wall collapsed last year, inspectors flagged buildings for insufficient smoke detectors, poor air quality, evidence of rodents and vermin, halls without emergency lighting and junction boxes with exposed live wires.&quot;{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

==Healthcare==
115 year old Mount Vernon Hospital{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} has 228 beds{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}. It is part of the Sound Shore Health System{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} and provides in-patient, critical care, and ambulatory services to residents of Mount Vernon and neighboring communities. The hospital is most known for its premier Chronic Wound Treatment and Hyperbaric Center, which is one of the most advanced in the Northeast. It also offers a variety of services, including the Assertive Community Treatment Center (ACT), the Family Health and Wellness Center, the Hopfer School of Nursing, Hyperbaric Medicine, and Intensive Case Management.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Mount Vernon Hospital is one of four hospitals in the county that provides programs in medicine, nursing, surgery and podiatry. (Sound Shore Medical Center, White Plains Hospital, and Westchester Medical Center are the others.) The hospital has “some of the finest medical doctor educators on staff. There is a 92 percent pass rate on boards for medical residents.”{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Mount Vernon Hospital's emergency room treats 25,000 patients a year and is going to be expanded at a cost of $2.5 million, doubling its size from {{convert|9000|sqft|m2|-2}} to 18,500. The expansion plans include 15 private treatment rooms and upgrades to the waiting area, triage room and other areas in the emergency department.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

The area around the hospital has many medical office buildings and treatment facilities which provide healthcare to residents living in Mount Vernon, the southeast section of Yonkers, and the north Bronx, which shares a border with the city. For example, Planned Parenthood Hudson Peconic, the [[Planned Parenthood]] affiliate that services New York's [[Putnam County, New York|Putnam]], [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk]] and Westchester Counties, opened its first medical center in Mount Vernon in 1935; the affiliate remains a vital source for reproductive health care services to Mount Vernon residents.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

==Houses of worship==
The city's previous motto was &quot;A City That Believes&quot;. This is reflected in the houses of worship in the city that represent over 25 denominations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|journal=Official Website of the City of Mount Vernon, NY|url=http://cmvny.com/cmsget?exporturi=/export/sites/cmvny3/services/worship.html |title=Houses of Worship}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recreation==

===Indoor and outdoor recreation facilities===
The city limits contain a number of city parks large and small,&lt;ref&gt;[http://parks.westchestergov.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1919&amp;Itemid=3770 Willson's Woods Park] {{WebCite|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5uyTO2VL6|date =2010-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Willson's Woods Park]], a {{convert|23|acre|m2|adj=on}} county-owned park. One of the oldest parks in the county system, Willson's Woods offers a wave pool, water slides, and a spray deck and water playground, against the backdrop of an English Tudor style bathhouse. The park also has areas for picnicking and fishing. 

Straddling the Fleetwood-Chester Heights border is Hunt's Woods, a county preserve taken over by the city in 1967. It is a small stretch of open woods with hiking and nature trails. 

The grounds of Hutchinson Field, located on the southbound side of the [[Hutchinson River Parkway]], include many outdoor minor-league fields and a batting cage, as well as the ''Ice Hutch'', a domed sports complex where [[ice hockey]] is played indoors during the winter and indoor [[golf]] and [[tennis]] are available year-round. 

Adjacent to Hutchinson Field is the stadium-like Memorial Field, which contains a track for running, a [[soccer]]/[[American football|football]] field, and a tennis court.

Hooperstown, a sports facility located on Sanford Boulevard (6th Street), contracts basketball-court time to teams and leagues and use of the facility for baseball clinics. It also rents the facility to other businesses that may offer one-on-one training or fitness camps. It is not yet open to the public.

===Events===
Numerous events take place in Mount Vernon periodically during the year, both indoors and outdoors. For example, the city hosts many annual events, such as a Memorial Day parade in May, [[Ben Gordon (basketball)|Ben Gordon]] Day (inspired by the NBA basketballer) in August, the Arts On Third Festival, which is the largest arts and entertainment festival in Westchester, NY over 50,000 people attend the one day festival in the month of September and a [[Veterans Day (United States)|Veterans Day]] parade in November.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Two MTA NYC bus routes serve two blocks in Mount Vernon: 
*The Bx16 travels to Mundy Lane (S. 11th Ave) between W. 5th Street (Nereid Avenue) and W. Sandford Blvd (Pittman Avenue)
*The FT 6X operates between Mount Vernon and The Bronx via Yonkers.

Olean is the largest city in [[Cattaraugus County]], and serves as the financial, business, transportation and entertainment center of the county. It is one of the principal cities of the [[Southern Tier]] region of New York.

The city is surrounded by the [[Olean (town), New York|Town of Olean]] and is located in the southeastern part of the county. The population was 14,452 at the 2010 Census.

==Geography==
Olean is located at {{Coord|42|4|57|N|78|25|51|W|type:city}} (42.08264, -78.430965).{{GR|1}}

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 6.2&amp;nbsp;square miles (16.0&amp;nbsp;km²), of which, 5.9&amp;nbsp;square miles (15.4&amp;nbsp;km²) of it is land and 0.2&amp;nbsp;square miles (0.6&amp;nbsp;km²) of it (3.73%) is water.

The city is located where Olean Creek flows into the [[Allegheny River]] and by the [[Southern Tier Expressway]] ([[Interstate 86 (east)|Interstate 86]] and [[New York State Route 17]]). [[New York State Route 417]] passes east-west through the city and intersects [[New York State Route 16]], a north-south highway.

==History==
The first European in the area was possibly [[Joseph de La Roche Daillon]], a missionary and explorer from Canada. La Roche reported on the presence of oil near [[Cuba (town), New York|Cuba]], the first petroleum sighting in North America. At that time the area was a part of the territory of the [[Wenrohronon]] or Wenro Indians, an [[Iroquois]] speaking people. In 1643, the Wenro tribes became the first victims of a series of brutal conflicts known as the Second [[Beaver Wars]].
The area was first settled by Europeans around 1765, called by the Indian name ''[[Ischua, New York|Ischua]]''. The surface is a hilly upland, separated into 2 distinct parts by the valley of the Allegheny. The highest points are 500–600 feet above the valley.

Originally the entire territory of the county of Cattaraugus was called the Town of Olean formed March 11, 1808. As population allowed the county was split in half and the top half was called &quot;Ischua&quot;, and was taken off in 1812, a part of Perrysburgh in 1814, then Great Valley in 1818. Hinsdale formed in 1820, and Portville, in 1837, leaving the current boundary of Olean that lies upon the south line of the county, near the southeast corner. The area remained sparsely populated until 1804, when Major [[Adam Hoops]] acquired the land and gave it its modern name. Hoops was a surveyor and Revolutionary War veteran, and was politically connected with [[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]], the financier of the Revolution. Along with Morris, Hoops became involved with the [[Holland Land Company]], which was settling Western New York.

This was a time of great Western expansion into places like [[Ohio]] and [[Indiana]]. Since neither canals nor railroads had  become widespread by this point, the main means of travel were either by cart or by small-boat travel. The [[Allegheny River]] was a major transportation route. Hoops believed that a great city could be created at the confluence of the Allegany and one of its tributaries, and went looking for the right spot. In 1804, he found one where the Olean Creek meets the river, and received title to {{convert|20000|acre|km2}} from the Holland Land Company in 1804. Hoops' brother Robert came to the site and built the first permanent structure near today's Forness Park, calling the area ''Hamilton'' in honor of [[Alexander Hamilton]].

In a letter to [[Joseph Ellicott]] in 1804, Hoops discusses the name ''Olean'' from the local [[Oil Springs Reservation|Oil Springs]] and the Latin word ''oleum'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Canandaigua, N.Y., April 15, 1804
“To Joseph ELLICOTT, Esq., Batavia, New York.
Dear Sir,―It was proposed to me at New York to drop the Indian name of Ischue or Ischua (it is also spelt other ways). Confusion might arise from the various spellings, of which to obviate all risk I have concluded so to do as proposed. The neighborhood of the oil spring suggests a name different in sound, though perhaps not different in meaning, which I wish to adopt,―it is “Olean.”You will do me a favor by assisting me to establish this name. It may easily be done now by your concurrence. The purpose will be most effectually answered by employing the term, when occasion requires, without saying anything of an intended change of name. To begin, you will greatly oblige me by addressing the first letter you may have occasion to write to me, after I receive the survey, to the Mouth of Olean. The bearer being properly instructed, there will be thereafter no difficulty. Your co-operation in the matter (the effect of which, though not important in itself, may be so on account of precision) will oblige. Your servant,  A. HOOPS
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Another claim is that Hoops named the area after one little girl named Olean Shepard, the first child of European descent born in the area, however, Olean Shepard's birthday was May 22, 1807, born well after the area was known by the Olean moniker. Regardless of the origin, the Post Office recognized the new town as ''Olean Point''. The site was surveyed by 1808, and a map from that year shows a basic street pattern that still survives, along with most of the modern street names. In 1823, the city is called Olean, without the ''Point'', on county maps.

In 1854 Olean was formally incorporated by the [[New York State Legislature]], and the trustees elected at the first subsequent town meeting were Dr. Lambert Thithney, C.B.B. Barse, Charles Thing, and John K. Comstock. Enos C. Brooks, descendant of Judge  James Brooks and Cornelius Brooks (one of the earliest settlers of Olean (1808)), was appointed Clerk of Olean.&lt;ref&gt;HISTORY OF CATTARAUGUS COUNTY, NEW YORK, Town of Olean, L.H.

===Timber and railroads===
Adam Hoops's dream of creating a major transportation hub on the Allegany River — on the scale of a Buffalo or a Pittsburgh — was never realized, and he himself died in poverty. Nonetheless, Olean prospered and was soon the central town of the region. Olean grew quickly as a transportation hub for migrants taking the Allegany River into Ohio. For much of this era, Olean was larger and better known than its northern competitor, [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]. This period ended with the creation of the great canals, especially the Erie Canal in 1825.

Timber was a major industry in New York and Pennsylvania between 1830 and 1850, and Olean was the chief city timber town in the region during those times. After river travel declined, Olean became the regional railroad hub. The town was the crossroads of several railroads, a situation which endures into today with the [[Western New York and Pennsylvania Railroad (2001)|WNYP]].

Olean was the home of several corporations. During the late 19th century, Olean had a few mills, a bicycle company, a manufacturer of mechanical pumps, and a glass works, among other factories. [[St. Bonaventure University]] was founded just outside of town in 1858. Olean was incorporated as a village in 1854, and as a city in 1893.

===Oil and rum-running===
Oil was first discovered in the region by a French explorer in 1632, but it was rediscovered for commercial use during the [[Pennsylvanian oil rush]]. Oil became the city's claim to fame for fifty years.

Olean was the railroad and pipeline hub for the surrounding oil region. The operations HQ of Standard Oil's New York affiliate, [[Socony]], was based in the city. Oil produced on both sides of the state line (e.g. in [[Bradford, Pennsylvania]]) would be transported to Olean for rail travel. For a short time, Olean was the world's largest oil depot, complete with a [http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nycattar/towns/Olean/images/OilTanks.htm &quot;tank city&quot;] on the edge of town. A pipeline was also built linking the city to Standard Oil refineries in Bayonne, New Jersey. The oil industry maintained a presence in the city until 1954, the same year in which Olean's population peaked.

Oil also produced Olean's highest ranking politician. Oil executive [[Frank W. Higgins]] was [[Governor of New York]] in 1905-1907. Higgins' family owned grocery stores in the area, and Higgins also ran this business before his political career. To this day, Olean is one of the few smaller cities in New York State to be home to a governor.

Olean garnered notoriety as a major stop on bootlegging routes during [[Prohibition]] in 1920s. Dempsey, the Chief of Police, did not condone these thugs or their illegal activities. He did not aggressively pursue arrests, however, unless he had evidence the violator was responsible for a crime committed in his jurisdiction. As long as you kept your nose clean in the Olean City limits, it was a “safe haven”. Local stories relating to this period are numerous. Some are documented and some are legends. Olean, located on a back road route between Chicago and New York City, was often frequented by famous mobsters of the era. Al Capone of Chicago, probably the most famous gang leader of the time, visited Olean in pursuance of his illegal endeavors. Olean was nicknamed &quot;Little Chicago&quot; in the press, due to its connection with mobsters and bootleggers, and [[Al Capone]] was a frequent visitor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cityofolean.org/history/history2.html | work=City of Olean | title=Web Page| date=2012-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Today===
Olean is the largest city in Cattaraugus County. The city's population peaked at an estimated 24,000 during the 1950s. The current population is about 15,000.

'''Troy''' is a [[City (New York)|city]] in the [[US State]] of [[New York]] and the [[county seat|seat]] of [[Rensselaer County, New York|Rensselaer County]]. Troy is located on the western edge of Rensselaer County and on the eastern bank of the [[Hudson River]]. Troy has close ties to the nearby cities of [[Albany, New York|Albany]] and [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]], forming a region popularly called the [[Capital District]]. The city is one of the three major centers for the Albany-Schenectady-Troy Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), which has a population of 850,957. At the [[United States Census 2010|2010 census]], the population of Troy was 50,129. Troy's motto is ''Ilium fuit, Troja est'', which means &quot;Ilium was, Troy is&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Ilium fuit'' is the well-known expression from the [[Aeneid]], where it is the beginning of Parthus' reply to Aeneas. Aeneid, Bk. II., 325. 30 153, and which had come to mean a complete and final end. The second half, ''Troja est'', is a defiant declaratory statement that nevertheless, Troy still lives.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before European arrival, the area was settled by the [[Mahican]] [[Indian tribe]]. There were at least two settlements within today's city limits, ''Panhooseck'' and ''Paanpack''. The Dutch began settling in the mid 17th century; the [[patroon]] [[Kiliaen van Rensselaer (Dutch merchant)|Kiliaen van Rensselaer]] called the area Pafraets Dael, after his mother. Control of New York passed to the English in 1664 and in 1707 Derick Van der Heyden purchased a farm near today's [[Central Troy Historic District|downtown area]]. In 1771 Abraham Lansing had his farm in today's [[Lansingburgh, New York|Lansingburgh]] laid out into lots. Responding to Lansing's success to the north, in 1787, Van der Heyden's grandson Jacob had his extensive holdings surveyed and laid out into lots as well, calling the new village Vanderheyden.

In 1789, Troy got its current name after a vote of the people. In 1791, Troy was incorporated as a [[Town (New York)|town]] and extended east across the county to the [[Vermont]] line and included [[Petersburgh, New York|Petersburgh]]. In 1796 Troy became a [[Village (New York)|village]] and in 1816 it became a city. Lansingburgh, to the north, was still a separate village, the first to have ever been incorporated in the State. Lansingburgh became part of Troy in 1900, though it maintained a very separate identity and still does to this day.

Troy is known as the Collar City due to its history in shirt, collar, and other textile production. At one point Troy was also the second largest producer of iron in the country, surpassed only by the city of [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]]. The Rensselaer School, which later became [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]], was founded in 1824 with funding from [[Stephen Van Rensselaer]], a descendant of the founding patroon, Kiliaen. In 1821, [[Emma Willard]] founded the [[Troy Female Seminary]] on 2nd Street, which moved to its current location on Pawling Avenue in 1910. It was renamed [[Emma Willard School]] in 1895. The former Female Seminary was later reopened (1916) as [[Russell Sage College]], thanks to funding from [[Olivia Slocum Sage]], the widow of financier and [[United States House of Representatives|Congressman]] [[Russell Sage]]. All of these institutions still exist today.

The city operates under a [[mayor-council government]]; [[Lou Rosamilia]] is the current mayor and Lynn Kopka is the council president.

==History==
{{Main|History of Troy, New York}}
Prior to the arrival of [[Europe]]ans, the [[Mohican|Mohican Indians]] had a number of settlements along the [[Hudson River]] near the confluence with the [[Mohawk River]]. The land comprising the Poesten Kill and Wynants Kill areas were owned by two Mohican groups. The land around the Poesten Kill was owned by ''Skiwias'' and was called ''Panhooseck''. The area around the Wynants Kill, was known as ''Paanpack'', was owned by ''Peyhaunet''. The land between the creeks, which makes up most of [[Central Troy Historic District|downtown]] and South Troy, was owned by ''Annape''. South of the Wynants Kill and into present-day [[North Greenbush, New York|North Greenbush]], the land was owned by ''Pachquolapiet''. These parcels of land were sold to the [[United Netherlands|Dutch]] between 1630 and 1657 and each purchase was overseen and signed by Skiwias, the [[sachem]] at the time.&lt;ref name=rittner27&gt;Rittner (2002), p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; In total, more than 75 individual Mohicans were involved in deed signings in the 17th century.&lt;ref name=rittner22&gt;Rittner (2002), p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

The site of the city was a part of [[Rensselaerswyck]], a [[patroonship]] created by [[Kiliaen van Rensselaer (Dutch merchant)|Kiliaen van Rensselaer]]. Dirck Van der Heyden was one of the first settlers.  In 1707, he purchased a farm of {{convert|65|acre|ha}} which in 1787 was laid out as a village.

An early local legend that a Dutch girl had been kidnapped by an Indian male who did not want her to marry someone else gained some credence when two skeletons were found in a cave under Poestenkill Falls &lt;!-- I wonder if this is the correct falls as this article had the incorrect falls named for the iron works. I have seen a cave under the Poestenkill Falls so likely this is correct) --&gt; in the 1950s. One skeleton was female and Caucasian with an iron ring. The other was Native-American and male.

The name Troy (after the legendary city of [[Troy]], made famous in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'') was adopted in 1789, and the region was formed into the Town of Troy in 1791 from part of the [[Manor of Rensselaerswyck]]. The township included [[Brunswick, New York|Brunswick]] and [[Grafton, New York|Grafton]]. Troy became a village in 1801 and was chartered as a city in 1816. In 1900, the city of Lansingburgh was merged into Troy. In the post-Revolutionary War years, as central New York was first settled, there was a strong trend to classical names, and Troy's naming fits the same pattern as the New York cities of Syracuse, Rome, Utica, Ithaca, or the towns of Sempronius, Manlius, or dozens of other classically named towns to the west of Troy.

Northern and Western New York was a theater of the [[War of 1812]], and militia and regular army forces were led by [[Stephen Van Rensselaer III|Stephen Van Rensselaer]] of Troy. Quartermaster supplies were shipped through Troy. A local butcher and meat-packer named [[Samuel Wilson]] supplied the military, and, according to an unprovable legend, barrels stamped &quot;U.S.&quot; were jokingly taken by the troops to stand for &quot;[[Uncle Sam]]&quot; meaning Wilson. Troy has since claimed to be the historical home of Uncle Sam.

Through much of the 19th and into the early 20th century, Troy was not only one of the most prosperous cities in New York State, but one of the most prosperous cities in the entire country. Prior to its rise as an industrial center, Troy was the transshipment point for meat and vegetables from Vermont which were sent by the Hudson River to New York City. The Federal Dam at Troy is the head of the tides in the Hudson River and Hudson River sloops and steamboats plied the river on a regular basis. This trade was vastly increased after the construction of the [[Erie Canal]], with its eastern terminus directly across the Hudson from Troy at [[Cohoes, New York|Cohoes]] in 1825.

Troy's one-time great wealth was produced in the steel industry, with the first American [[Bessemer process|Bessemer converter]] erected on the Wyantskill, a stream with a falls in a small valley at the south end of the city.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;A Resourceful People A Pictorical History of Rensselaer County, New York&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The industry first used charcoal and iron ore from the Adirondacks.  Later on, ore and coal from the Midwest was shipped on the [[Erie Canal]] to Troy, and there processed before being sent on down the Hudson to New York City. The iron and steel was also used by the extensive federal arsenal across the Hudson at [[Watervliet, New York]], then called West Troy. After the [[American Civil War]], the steel production industry moved west to be closer to raw materials. The presence of iron and steel also made it possible for Troy to be an early site in the development of iron storefronts and steel structural supports in architecture, and there are some significant early examples still in the city.

The initial emphasis on heavier industry later spawned a wide variety of highly engineered mechanical and scientific equipment. Troy was the home of [[Gurley Precision Instruments|W. &amp; L. E. Gurley, Co.]], makers of precision instruments. Gurley's theodolites were used to survey much of the American West after the Civil War and were highly regarded until laser and digital technology eclipsed the telescope and compass technology in the 1970s. Bells manufactured by Troy's [[Meneely Bell Foundry|Meneely Bell Company]] ring all over the world. And Troy was also home to a manufacturer of racing shells that used impregnated paper in a process that presaged the later use of fiberglass, Kevlar and carbon fiber composites.

This scientific and technical proficiency was supported by the presence of [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]], or RPI, one of the highest-ranked engineering schools in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=America's Best Colleges 2007|author=US News|year=2006|url=http://www.usnews.com/usnews/edu/college/rankings/brief/t1natudoc_brief.php|accessdate=2007-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; RPI was originally sponsored by [[Stephen Van Rensselaer III|Stephen Van Rensselaer]], one of the most prominent members of that family. RPI was founded in 1824, and eventually absorbed the campus of the short-lived, liberal arts based [[Troy University (New York)|Troy University]], which closed in 1862 during the Civil War. Rensselaer founded RPI for the &quot;application of science to the common purposes of life&quot;, and it is the oldest technological university in the English-speaking world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RPI History Main Page|url=http://www.rpi.edu/about/history.html|accessdate=2007-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The institute is known for its success in the transfer of technology from the laboratory to the marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catalog.rpi.edu/content.php?catoid=4&amp;navoid=76|title=Rensselaer in Brief|year=2008|accessdate=2008-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 23, 1823, ''The Troy Sentinel'' was the first publisher of the world-famous Christmas poem &quot;[[A Visit from St. Nicholas]]&quot; (also known as &quot;The Night Before Christmas&quot; or &quot;Twas the Night Before Christmas&quot;). The poem was published anonymously. Its author has long been believed to have been [[Clement Clarke Moore]], but its author is now regarded by a few to have been [[Henry Livingston, Jr.]] {{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

Troy was an early home of professional baseball, and was the host of two major league teams. The first team to call Troy home was the [[Troy Haymakers]], a [[National Association of Professional Base Ball Players|National Association]] team in 1871 and 1872. One of their major players was [[Bill Craver|Williams H. &quot;Bill&quot; Craver]], a noted catcher and Civil War veteran, who also managed the team. Their last manager was [[Jimmy Wood]], reckoned the first Canadian in professional baseball. The Troy Haymakers folded, and Troy had no team for seven seasons. Then, for four seasons, 1879 to 1882, Troy was home to the [[National League]] [[Troy Trojans (MLB team)|Troy Trojans]]. The Trojans were not competitive in the league, but they did have the biggest hitter in professional baseball, [http://www.baseball-almanac.com/teams/troy.shtml Dan Brouthers.]

For the 1883 season, the Trojans were moved to New York City where they became the [[New York Gothams]], known later as the Giants. {{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} The Gothams had the same ownership as the [[New York Metropolitans]] of the rival American Association.  As a result classic Met players became Giants, including Hall of Fame Pitcher Tim Keefe. Troy was also the birthplace of the famous player [[King Kelly|Michael Joseph &quot;King&quot; Kelly]].

Troy has been nearly destroyed by fire three times.  The Great Troy fire of 1862 burnt the W. &amp; L. E. Gurley, Co. factory, which was later that year replaced by the new [[W. &amp; L. E. Gurley Building]], now a [[National Historic Landmark]]: Gurley &amp; Sons remains a world-wide leader in precision instrumentation.

In 1892, Robert Ross, a poll watcher, was shot dead (and his brother wounded) by operatives of Mayor Edward Murphy, later a U.S. Senator, after uncovering a man committing voter fraud. The convicted murderer, Bartholomew &quot;Bat&quot; Shea, was executed in 1896, although another man, John McGough, later boasted that he had actually been the shooter. {{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

In 1900 Troy annexed [[Lansingburgh, New York|Lansingburgh]], a former town and village whose standing dates back prior to the War of Independence, in Rensselaer County. Lansingburgh is thus often referred to as &quot;North Troy&quot;. However, prior to the annexation, that portion of Troy north of Division Street was called North Troy and the neighborhood south of Washington Park is referred to as South Troy. To avoid confusion with streets in Troy following the annexation, Lansingburgh's numbered streets were renamed: its 1st Street, 2nd Street, 3rd Street, etc., became North Troy's 101st Street, 102nd Street, 103rd Street, etc. Lansingburgh was home to the [[Lansingburgh Academy]].

[[Image:Leyendecker arrow color 1907.jpg|thumb|Illustration for Arrow Collar, 1907. J.C. Leyendecker.]]
In addition to the strong presence of the early American steel industry, Troy was also a manufacturing center for shirts, shirtwaists, collars and cuffs. In 1825, a local resident [[false-collar|Hannah Lord Montague]], was tired of cleaning her blacksmith husband's shirts. She cut off the collars of her husband's shirts, since only the collar was soiled, bound the edges and attached strings to hold them in place. (This also allowed the collars and cuffs to be starched separately.) Montague's idea caught on, and changed the fashion for American men's dress for a century. Her patented collars and cuffs were first manufactured by Maullin &amp; Blanchard, which eventually was absorbed by [[The Arrow Collar Man|Cluett, Peabody &amp; Company]]. Cluett's &quot;Arrow shirts&quot; are still worn by men across the country.[http://www.arrowshirt.com/heritage.aspx] The large labor force required by the shirt manufacturing industry also, in 1864, produced the nation's first female [[labor union]], the [[Collar Laundry Union]], founded in Troy by [[Kate Mullany]]. On February 23, 1864, 300 members of the union went on strike. After six days, the laundry owners gave in to their demands and raised wages 25%. There were further developments in the industry, when, in 1933, Sanford Cluett invented a process he called [[Sanforization]], a process which shrinks [[cotton]] [[textile|fabric]]s thoroughly and permanently. Cluett, Peabody's last main plant in Troy was closed in the 1980s, but the industrial output of the plant had long been transferred to facilities in the South.

When the iron &amp; steel industry moved to Pennsylvania and beyond, and with a similar downturn in the collar industry, Troy's prosperity began to fade. After the passage of [[Prohibition]], and given the strict control of [[Albany, New York|Albany]] by the  O'Connell political machine, Troy became a way station for an illegal alcohol trade from Canada to New York City. Likewise, the stricter control of morality laws in the neighboring [[New England]] states, left Troy with openly operating speakeasies and brothels. Gangsters such as [[Jack Diamond (gangster)|Legs Diamond]] conducted business in Troy. This gave Troy a somewhat colorful reputation through [[World War II]]. A few of the finer houses have since been converted to fine restaurants, such as the former Old Daly Inn.

Like many old industrial cities, Troy has had to deal with not only the loss of its manufacturing base, but a drainage of population and wealth to [[suburbs]] and other parts of the country.  Troy's population in 1910 was over 75,000. These factors have led to a sizable degree of dilapidation and disinvestment, although numerous efforts have been made to preserve Troy's architectural and cultural past.

[[Kurt Vonnegut]] lived in Troy and the area, and many of his novels include mentions of Ilium, (Troy), or surrounding local references. Vonnegut wrote [[Player Piano (novel)|''Player Piano'']] in 1952, is based on his experiences working as a public relations writer at [[General Electric]]. His 1963 novel, ''[[Cat's Cradle (novel)|Cat's Cradle]]'', was written in the city, and mentions being in Ilium. His recurring main character, Kilgore Trout, is a resident of [[Cohoes, New York|Cohoes]], on the opposite side of the Hudson from Troy.

==Geography==
[[File:City of Troy map 2.svg|left|thumb|Map of the neighborhoods of Troy]]
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|11.0|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|10.4|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|0.6|sqmi|km2}} (5.44%) is water.

Troy is located several miles north of Albany near the junction of the Erie and Champlain canals, via the [[Hudson River]] and is the terminus of the [[New York Barge Canal]]. It is the distributing center for a large area.&lt;ref name = Breuer&gt;Robert Breuer, [http://www.troyvisitorcenter.org/tours/canal.html Troy's ''RiverSpark'' Visitor Center]. Retrieved 1 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The city is on the central part of the western border of Rensselaer County. The Hudson River makes up the western border of the city and the county's border with Albany County. The city borders within Rensselaer County, [[Schaghticoke, New York|Schaghticoke]] to the north, [[Brunswick, New York|Brunswick]] to the east, and [[North Greenbush, New York|North Greenbush]] to the south; to the west the city borders the Albany County town of [[Colonie, New York|Colonie]], the villages of [[Menands, New York|Menands]] and [[Green Island, New York|Green Island]], and the cities of [[Watervliet, New York|Watervliet]] and [[Cohoes, New York|Cohoes]]. To the northwest Troy borders the Saratoga County village of [[Waterford (village), New York|Waterford]] within the town of [[Waterford, New York|Waterford]]

The western edge of the city is flat along the river, and then steeply slopes to higher terrain to the east. The average elevation is 50 feet, with the highest elevation being 500 feet in the eastern part of the city. The city is longer than it is wide, with the southern part wider than the northern section of the city (the formerly separate city of [[Lansingburgh, New York|Lansingburgh]]). Several [[kill (body of water)|kills]] ([[Dutch (language)|Dutch]] for creek) pass through Troy and empty into the Hudson. The Poesten Kill and Wynants Kill are the two largest and both have several small lakes and waterfalls along their routes in the city. There are several lakes and reservoirs within the city including Ida Lake, Burden Pond, Lansingburgh Reservoir, Bradley Lake, Smarts Pond and Wright Lake.

==Economy==
{{Expand section|date=February 2009}}
Troy, like many older industrial cities, has been battered by industrial decline and the migration of jobs to the suburbs. Nevertheless, the presence of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute is helping Troy develop a small high-technology sector, particularly in video game development. The downtown core also has a smattering of advertising and architecture firms, and other creative businesses attracted by the area's distinctive architecture. Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute is the city's largest private employer.

Troy is also home to Russell Sage College (specializing in careers often pursued by women), 10,000 student Hudson Valley Community College (part of the SUNY system = State University of New York's 30+ two-year technical colleges), three private high schools: La Salle Institute (catholic military-style) and Emma Willard School (USA's first girl's high school and a high-academic boarding and day school) and Catholic Central High School (a regional Catholic high school in Lansingburg section).

Northeast Health is now the umbrella administration of Troy two large hospitals (Samaritan Hospital and St. Mary's Hospital).  The city is also home to many non-profits including the many good services provided by Unity House, Joseph's House, numerous churches (orthodox, catholic, Protestant) and three synagoges and one mosque.

==Architecture==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2011}}
Troy is home to [[Victorian era|Victorian]] and [[Belle Époque]] [[architecture]]. The city's architectural achievements rate inspirational and serve its citizens, visitors and onlookers as well as posterity, with as a veritable treasure chest set in masonry exteriors, as evidenced by the sheer variety of its building’s design vernacular, which includes specimens redolent of numerous ancient civilizations’ and later European edifice models.
Notably, the city's First and Second [[Industrial Revolution]]s' decades-long innovations and successes enabled commercial and residential builders the financial means and engineering knowledgebase to express themselves in highly-individualized, and most often, grand masonry buildings. That opportunity to build such wondrous structures is owed, in part, too, to the fact that two major fires had devastated much of Troy’s earlier wooden structures, availing large tracts for re-development.

The Hudson and Mohawk rivers play their part, as does the [[Erie Canal]] and its lesser tributary canal systems, and later the railroads that linked Troy to the rest of the [[Empire State]], [[New York City]] to the south, and [[Utica, New York]], [[Syracuse, New York]], [[Rochester, New York]], [[Buffalo, New York]] and the myriad of emergent [[Great Lakes]]' cities in the burgeoning United States.

===Notable buildings in Troy===
* [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]]
* The Emma Willard School for Girls aka [[Emma Willard School]]
* [[Russell Sage College]]
* [[Troy Public Library]] (to this day a private institution in service to the City of Troy)
* The original [[The Albany Academy]], was founded, too, in what is now known as North Troy, formerly the village of Lansingburg
* [[Hudson Valley Community College]]

Natives of Troy expressed their passion for building, using the following materials, for an array building features:
* Iron: cast and structural iron works (facades, gates, railings, banisters, stairwells, rooftop crenellation, window grilles, etc.)
* Stone: carved hard and soft stone foundations, facades and decorative elements
* Glass: as well as in the vast array of ornate stained and etched glass works;
* Wood: fine wood work in found in many of Troy's buildings.

Tiffany and La Farge created magnificent stained-glass windows, transoms and other decorative stained-glass treatments for their customers in Troy. Rich with resplendent 19th-century architecture, particularly in its [[Central Troy Historic District]], it is no wonder that several major movies have been filmed in Troy, including ''[[Ironweed (film)|Ironweed]]'', ''[[The Age of Innocence (1993 film)|The Age of Innocence]]'', ''[[Scent of a Woman (1992 film)|Scent of a Woman]]'', ''[[The Bostonians (film)|The Bostonians]]'', ''[[The Emperor's Club]]'', and ''[[The Time Machine (2002 film)|The Time Machine]].'' There are many buildings in a state of disrepair, but community groups and investors are restoring many of them.

Troy's downtown historic landmarks include '''Frear's Troy Cash Bazaar''', constructed on a steel infrastructure clad in ornately carved white marble; the [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] Courthouse that is constructed of gray granite, the Margaret Olivia Sage Library (the Troy Public Library), built in an elaborate [[Venetian palazzo]] style with high-relief carved white marble; the Troy Savings Bank Music Hall, designed in the [[Second Empire (architecture)|Second Empire]] style, with a recital hall with highly regarded acoustic properties. There is a rich collection of [[American colonial architecture|Colonial]], [[Federal architecture|Federal]], [[Italianate]], [[Second Empire (architecture)|Second Empire]], [[Greek Revival]], [[Egyptian Revival]], [[Gothic Revival]] and other [[Romantic period]] townhouses surrounding the immediate downtown. The [http://www.rchsonline.org/ar_hc.htm Hart-Cluett Mansion] displays a Federal facade executed in white marble, quarried in [[Tuckahoe, Westchester County, New York|Tuckahoe, New York]]. Often with foundations of [[Rustication (architecture)|rusticated]] granite block. Medina sandstone, a deep mud-red color, from [[Medina, New York]], was also used.&lt;ref&gt;[[Second Street Historic District (Troy, New York)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

As with many American cities, several city blocks in downtown Troy were razed during the 1970s as a part of an attempted [[urban renewal]] plan which was never successfully executed, leaving still vacant areas in the vicinity of Federal Street. Today, however, there have since been much more successful efforts to save the remaining historic downtown structures.
[[File:RiverStreetTroyNY.JPG|thumb|right|Northern River Street]]
Part of this effort has been the arrival of the &quot;Antique District&quot; on River Street downtown. Cafes and art galleries are calling the area home. As home to many art, literature, and music lovers, the city hosts many free shows during the summer, on River Street, in parks, and in cafes and coffee shops. The [http://www.troymarket.org/ Troy Farmer's Market] is a popular event since 2000 that occurs every Saturday on River Street during the summer, or in the Atrium of downtown Troy during the winter.

===Annual events===
* '''The Troy Flag Day Parade''', one of the nation's largest,{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} held in early June.
* '''River Street Festival''', an annual, family-oriented arts/crafts and music festival held in June.
* '''The Uncle Sam Parade''', held in proximity to [[Samuel Wilson]]'s birthday (mid-September).
* '''Bakerloo Theatre Project''', a classical summer theatre.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bakerloo.org&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''The Victorian Stroll''', an annual holiday event held in December.

* '''[[Troy Night Out]]''', a monthly (last Friday) event in downtown Troy where retail establishments remain open.

==Education==
There were several important educational advances that took place in Troy, especially in scientific education and the education of women.

Under the patronage of [[Stephen Van Rensselaer III|Stephen van Rensselaer]], Troy was the home of the first strictly scientific academic institution in the United States, [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]], founded in 1824, and which trained students who later founded the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], and the [[Sheffield Scientific School]] at [[Yale]].{{cn|date=November 2013}}

[[Emma Willard]] was a national leader in the education of women, and the author of standard instructional textbooks used for decades nationwide. She was involved in the establishment of several women's colleges, but most especially in Troy the [[Russell Sage College]], and the [[Emma Willard School]].

'''Utica''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|j|uː|t|ɨ|k|ə}} is a [[City (New York)|city]] in the Mohawk Valley and the [[county seat]] of [[Oneida County, New York|Oneida County]], [[New York]], [[United States]].{{GR|6}}  The population was 62,235 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], an increase of 2.6% from the [[2000 United States Census|2000 census]] due largely to a large immigrant refugee influx.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Utica and the neighboring city of [[Rome, New York|Rome]] are principal cities of the [[Utica-Rome metropolitan area|Utica&amp;ndash;Rome, New York Metropolitan Statistical Area]], which includes Oneida and [[Herkimer County, New York|Herkimer]] counties.

==History==

===Early history===
Utica is located at the shallowest spot along the [[Mohawk River]] which made it the best place for fording across, and an [[Iroquois]] Indian crossroads and fording location made trade exceedingly easy for local merchants. With a shallow spot on the river that was already inhabited by trading partners, the location was ideal for a settlement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clarke&quot;&gt;Clarke, T. W. (1952). Utica for a Century and a Half. Utica N.Y.: Widtman Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Utica was first settled by Europeans in 1773, on the site of [[Old Fort Schuyler|Fort Schuyler]] which was built in 1758. The fort was named Fort Schuyler after [[Philip Schuyler|Col. Philip Schuyler]], a hero of the [[French and Indian War]]. After the French and Indian War the fort was abandoned and then during the [[American Revolution]] the original settlement (''Yunę́ʼnare·θ''&lt;ref&gt;Rudes, B. ''Tuscarora English Dictionary'' Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Tuscarora language|Tuscarora]]) was destroyed by [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Tories]] and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. The settlement eventually became known as Old Fort Schuyler when a military fort in nearby [[Fort Stanwix]] in [[Rome, New York]] was renamed Fort Schuyler during the American Revolution and evolved into a village.

In 1794, a road was built to [[Albany, New York]] known as State Road. By 1797 the road was extended and completed to the [[Genesee River]] and the full road was known as it is now, Genesee Road. The creation of the [[Seneca Turnpike]] was the first significant factor in the growth and development of Utica, as this small settlement became the resting and relocating area on the [[Mohawk River]] for goods and people moving into Western New York and past the Great Lakes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Przybycien&quot;&gt;Przybycien, F. E. (1976). Utica: A City Worth Saving. Utica : Dodge-Graphic Press, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moses Bagg, a blacksmith, built a small tavern near Old Fort Schuyler to accommodate weary travelers waiting for their horse's shoes to be repaired. After just a few years this small shanty tavern became a two story inn and pub known as [[Bagg's Hotel]]. The first bridge over the [[Mohawk River]] was erected in the summer of 1792 by a Long Island carpenter who had settled in Utica, Apollos Cooper, although local and regional architects that had seen the bridge were very skeptical to use it, and the bridge was soon destroyed in the spring floods.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tomaino&quot;&gt;Tomaino, F. (2008, May 29). [http://www.uticaod.com/history/x244767716/This-Week-in-History-A-bridge-to-Deerfield &quot;This Week in History: A bridge to Deerfield&quot;]. Retrieved 2010-03-25, ''[[Observer-Dispatch]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The perhaps apocryphal account of Utica's naming suggests that around a dozen citizens of the Old Fort Schuyler settlement met at the [[Bagg's Tavern]] to discuss the name of the emerging village.  Unable to settle on one particular name, Erastus Clark's entrant of &quot;Utica&quot; was drawn from several suggestions, and the village thereafter became associated with [[Utica, Tunisia]], the ancient [[Carthage|Carthaginian]] city.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Utica was incorporated as a village in 1798. Utica expanded its borders in subsequent charters in 1805 and 1817.&lt;ref&gt;[&quot;Utica.&quot; from The History of Oneida County; Oneida County Historical Society, 1977]&lt;/ref&gt; Expansion and growth continued to occur in Utica; by 1817 the population had reached 2,860 people. Genesee Street was packed with shops and storefronts, a prosperous stagecoach line had expanded its business, a fully established bank was founded by Alexander Johnson, a newspaper company [[The Observer-Dispatch|The Utica Observer]] established by William McLean, five churches as well as two hotels were all located within this center square of Utica.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clarke&quot; /&gt;
Suffering from poor harvests in 1789 and 1802 and dreaming of land ownership, the initial settlement of five Welsh families soon attracted other agricultural migrants, settling Steuben, Utica and Remsen townships. Adapting their traditional agricultural methods, the Welsh became the first to introduce dairying into the region and Welsh butter became a valued commodity on the New York market. Drawing on the size of the local ethnic community and the printing industry of Utica became the cultural center of Welsh-American life by 1830. The Welsh-American publishing industry included 19 different publishers who published 240 Welsh language imprints, 4 denominational periodicals and the influential newspaper [[Y Drych]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

However, the Welsh community in Utica was never very large and was often dwarfed by other ethnicities, most notably the Polish and Italians. The largest nationality group of the great migration to America between 1880 and 1920, Italians trace their presence in Utica to the arrival of Dr. John B. Marchisi in 1817. A prosperous pharmacist, he was the first of thousands of Italians to arrive in Oneida County over the next century.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

===Industrial era===
[[File:Utica NY c1909 LOC pan 6a14200.jpg|thumb|right|600px|1909 panorama]]
Utica's location on the [[Erie Canal]] stimulated its industrial development. The middle section of the Canal, from [[Rome, New York|Rome]] to [[Salina, New York|Salina]], was the first portion to open in 1820. The [[Chenango Canal]], connecting Utica and [[Binghamton]], opened in 1836, and provided a further stimulus for economic development by providing water transportation of [[coal]] from Northeast Pennsylvania. Utica’s population with the creation of the canals began to skyrocket. The population began to increase threefold over a span of ten years since the first section of the canal opened in 1819. Utica was the virtual half-way point for canal travelers, thus making the town the perfect stop-over point. During the planning stage of the canal the cotton looms that would make Utica famous were in their infancy,  and a vigorous real estate market in the town had ballooned lot prices tenfold since 1800.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}  An anonymous traveler noted that by 1829, about five years after the canal's completion, Utica had become &quot;a really beautiful place . . . [and Utica's State Street] in no respect inferior to [[Broadway (New York City)|Broadway]] in New York.&quot;  Utica, along with other burgeoning towns such as Syracuse, would benefit from the fact that the Erie Canal ran directly through town.&lt;ref&gt;''Wedding of the Waters'', by Peter Bernstein, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 19th century, Utica had become a transportation hub and a commercial center of considerable note, but was not like the heavy industrial towns in [[New England]]. Utica, in particular, was limited in its capability to produce industrial goods because the Mohawk River did not run fast enough to turn the industrial machines. Upon investigating the New England style of steam production, they found how to use coal in their manufacturing. Now with the recently completed [[Chenango Canal]] that connected Utica to the coal field in Pennsylvania, there was a vast supply readily available. Because of the [[Embargo Act of 1807]] that cut off the English textile production, the Northeast had a firm grasp on the textile industry. With investments from local entrepreneurs Utica’s textile industry was starting to really take off.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cookingham&quot;&gt;Cookinham, H. J. (1912). History of Oneida County N.Y. Chicago: SJ Clarke Publishing Company&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:UticaNY 1855.jpg|thumb|right|Bird's-eye view of Utica in 1855]]
The city still served as a Northeast crossroads, hosting the day's most celebrated personalities.  [[Samuel Clemens]]  lectured to a sold-out Utica crowd in 1870, where Clemens noted in personal correspondence that he brought down the house &quot;like an avalanche.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Twain: A Life, by Ron Powers, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; It was during this time that Utica hosted the 1884 New York State Republican Convention, an event covered in great detail in Edmund Morris' Pulitzer Prize winning biography The Rise of [[Theodore Roosevelt]], in which Morris describes Utica at this time as &quot;a shabby canal-town in the middle of the Mohawk Valley.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt, by Edmund Morris, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;  Senator [[Roscoe Conkling]], a leading GOP lawmaker of the Stalwart political faction, resided in the city at this time, and figured as the region's most historically significant politician until local native [[James Schoolcraft Sherman]] was elected the 27th Vice President of the United States, serving under President [[William Howard Taft]].

Centered around the parishes of St. Mary of Mount Carmel and St. Anthony of Padua, Italian life and culture flourished, spreading throughout the county to cities, towns and small villages alike. While the immigrants arriving in the great migration usually found jobs in the local textile mills, brickyards, construction companies and unskilled manufacturing occupations, numerous entrepreneurs soon began small businesses running the spectrum of economic activity from push-cart peddlers and olive oil merchants to haberdashers, bankers and insurance agents. Italian language newspapers such as Il Pensiero Italiano, La Luce, and Il Messagero dell'Ordine, along with the humorous Il Pagliaccio and various organizational and cultural publications reflected the richness of Italian life in Oneida County.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

The Italian community rapidly grew to political prominence, forming an important voting block in elections as early as 1888. By 1910 Italians were being regularly elected to office in Utica, while some historians credit the East Utica Italian community as the spark that ignited Franklin D. Roosevelt's campaign for governor of New York in 1928.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} From the early 1940s the Italian community has played a dominant role in Utica and area politics.

In the 1930s through the 1950s Utica became nationally if not internationally known as &quot;Sin City&quot; for the extent of its corruption and control by the political machine of Rufus P. Elefante.&lt;ref&gt;''In Gotham's Shadow,'' Alexander R Thomas, State University of New York Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utica.edu/test/sincity.cfm &quot;The Sin City Scandals&quot; at Utica College]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mvcc.edu/academics/library/mohawk_valley.pdf ''Guts and Glory, Tragedy and Triumph: The Rufus P. Elefante Story,'' Nancy Kobryn, Mohawk Valley Community College Library Collection]{{dead link|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Utica, from the turn of the 20th century, had an [[organized crime]] presence, largely made up of the [[Italian mafia]]. The mafia presence was largely eliminated in the 1990s by federal indictments and convictions.&lt;ref name=&quot;uticaod.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.uticaod.com/mobfiles/x407217072/DAY-1-The-Mob-Files The Mob Files - The Observer-Dispatch, Utica, New York&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-20th century, virtually all of the textile mills closed and migrated to the American South. In the wake of the demise of the textile industry, Utica became a major player in the tool and die industry, which thrived in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, eventually declining in the late 20th century.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} In the early and mid-20th century, Utica had become a major manufacturing center for radios, manufactured by the [[General Electric]] company, which, at one time, employed some 8,000 workers there, and was once known as: &quot;The radio capital of the world.&quot; However, by the mid-1960s, General Electric had moved its radio manufacturing to the Far East. In the early 1990s, GE's Light Military Electronics operation in Utica was sold to [[Lockheed Martin]] and soon closed altogether.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} Like the textile industry before it, the machine tool industry largely forsook Utica for the American South, with one notable example being The Chicago Pneumatic Company, which shuttered its extensive manufacturing facility in Utica in 1997 and relocated to [[Rock Hill, South Carolina]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

===Post-industrial era===
Like many industrial towns and cities in the northeastern [[Rust Belt]], Utica has experienced a major reduction in manufacturing activity in the past several decades, and is in serious financial trouble; many public services have been curtailed to save money.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} Suburban Utica, particularly the town of New Hartford and the village of Whitesboro, have begun to experience [[suburban sprawl]]; this is common in many [[New York State]] cities, which are suffering from what the [[Sierra Club]] termed &quot;sprawl without growth.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} The city's economy is heavily dependent on commercial growth in its suburbs, a trend that is characterized by development of green sites in neighboring villages and does little to revitalize the city itself. Because of the decline of industry and employment in the post-World War II era, Utica became known as &quot;The City that God Forgot.&quot; In the 1980s and early 1990s, some of Utica's residents could be seen driving cars with bumper stickers that read &quot;Last One Out of Utica, Please Turn Out The Lights,&quot; clearly taking a more humorous stand on their city's rapid population loss and continued economic struggles.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

[[File:Utica Railroad Station.jpg|thumb|left|Boehlert Center at Union Station]]
City leaders and local entrepreneurs tried to build on the city's losses.  In 1997 the former GE-Lockheed facility was purchased by  ConMed Corporation (founded by Utica local Eugene Corasanti) for use as a manufacturing facility and the company's worldwide headquarters, bringing 500 new jobs to the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3718/is_199709/ai_n8778401 | work=CNY Business Journal | title=ConMed creates jobs for Oneida County | year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Boehlert Center at the newly restored, historic [[Union Station (Utica, New York)|Union Station]] in downtown Utica is a regional transportation hub for [[Amtrak]] and the [[Adirondack Scenic Railway]]. Next door to Union Station is The Children's Museum of History, Science &amp; Technology, a 5 story building built in the 1890s. Downtown Utica continues to be the focus of regional economic revitalization efforts. In 2010, Roefaro fulfilled a campaign promise and delivered the City's first Comprehensive Master Plan in over 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uticamasterplan.org/ City of Utica Master Plan]. Uticamasterplan.org. Retrieved on 2013-08-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

The arrival of a large number of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]]n immigrants over the past several years has stanched a population loss that had been steady for more than three decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Looking to Prosper as a Melting Pot; Utica, Long in Decline, Welcomes an Influx of Refugees |work=The New York Times |first=Paul |last=Zielbauer |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE3DD1E3CF934A35756C0A96F958260 |date=1999-05-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bosnian immigrants now constitute about 10% of the total population of Utica.  Other recent immigrant groups have arrived from [[Somalia]], [[Thailand]], [[Burma]], and [[Iraq]]. This influx of refugees from many war-torn nations and politically oppressive regimes has drawn mainstream national media attention, from The New York Times (see citation above) to Reader's Digest.  Reader's Digest dubbed Utica the &quot;Second Chance City&quot; in an article chronicling the crucial role that immigrants have traditionally played in invigorating Utica's political, economic, and social life; the article argues that Utica now hosts thousands of immigrants that have taken advantage of the city's social services benefits, welfare, public and private sector affordable housing, and entry-level skilled manufacturing jobs to start a new life, a trend that began nearly thirty years ago.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Second Chance City,&quot; Reader's Digest, August 2007, pp. 116-123.&lt;/ref&gt; In a cover story in their 2005 REFUGEES Magazine, the [[United Nations High Commission on Refugees]] wrote an extensive article on refugees in Utica, titling the publication, &quot;The Town That Loves Refugees&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/publ/PUBL/426f4c772.pdf Refugees Volume 1 Number 138 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

Utica's sole remaining public high school is [[Thomas R. Proctor High School]], as its original public high school (Utica Free Academy, founded in 1814) shut down in 1990. Utica is also home to Notre Dame High School, a small parochial high school, founded in 1959 by the Xaverian Brothers.

Collegiate choices in Utica include: [[Utica College of Syracuse University|Utica College]], [[State University of New York Institute of Technology]], [[Mohawk Valley Community College]], and [[Utica School of Commerce]]. Nearby colleges include [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]] in [[Clinton, Oneida County, New York|Clinton, New York]], [[Herkimer County Community College]] in [[Herkimer (village), New York|Herkimer, New York]], and [[Colgate University]] in [[Hamilton (village), New York|Hamilton, New York]].

Utica is the home of [[Utica College]], founded in 1946, as a four-year college founded by [[Syracuse University]]. Utica College was originally an urban campus in the Oneida Square area of the city. In 1961, it relocated to a modern {{convert|128|acre|km2|sing=on}} campus on the west side of Utica. Currently a new science wing and additional buildings are being added to the campus.

Utica is also the home of [[Mohawk Valley Community College]], which was founded in 1946 as the New York State Center of Applied Arts and Sciences at Utica, and was the first community college established in New York State.  MVCC  found its true raison d'etre during the 1950s as a training facility for unemployed textile workers looking to operate technical equipment at a new General Electric plant.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;General Electric Helps Rebuild the Mohawk Valley,&quot; by Julia G. Diliberto, pp. 85-103, from Building the Mohawk Valley, David G. Wittner, ed., Center for Historical Research, Utica College, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  The college became a fully accredited institution in 1960, and has gradually expanded its campus along Utica's Culver Avenue.

[[State University of New York Institute of Technology]] is located along the Utica and Marcy New York border, though it was first established in 1969 on Utica's westside.  A four-year institution, SUNYIT offers a variety of technology based majors and master's degree programs.

[[Empire State College]] was founded in 1971 and is one of thirteen SUNY colleges of arts and sciences.  Empire State College consists of eight centers with the Central New York Center being in Syracuse.  Each center has different units providing educational services for those communities.  The Utica Unit serves Oneida, Herkimer, Madison, and Otsego counties.

==Government==
{{Expand section|date=February 2009}}

The mayor is Ralph V. Suozzi, cousin of former Nassau County Executive [[Thomas Suozzi]].

Oyster Bay had jurisdiction over the area from the 1680s until 1917 when Glen Cove became an independent city.&lt;ref name=HOGC&gt;[http://www.nassaulibrary.org/glencove/History%20of%20Glen%20Cove.html Antonia Petrash, Carol Stern, and Carol McCrossen, &quot;HISTORY OF GLEN COVE&quot;], Nassau County Library&lt;/ref&gt;  Glen Cove has its own police, fire protection, and emergency medical services. The fire department and emergency medical services are volunteer agencies.  The Office of Emergency Management is responsible for the planning, coordination and response to natural and manmade emergencies that occur within the City of Glen Cove.

==History==
Succeeding cultures of [[indigenous peoples]] had lived in the area for thousands of years.  At the time of European contact, the [[Lenape]] (Delaware) nation inhabited western Long Island, the areas of New York and New Jersey around the harbor and along the coast through present-day Pennsylvania and Delaware, as well as along the Delaware River. They spoke an [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] language. By 1600 the band inhabiting the local area was called the [[Matinecock]] after their location, but they were Lenape people, as were all the Native Americans living on western Long Island.

Glen Cove was used as a port by [[English people|English]] migrants from New England and named &quot;Moscheto&quot; before 1668. On May 24, 1668 Joseph Carpenter of [[Warwick]], [[Rhode Island]] purchased about {{convert|2000|acre|km2}} of land to the northwest of the Town of [[Oyster Bay (town), New York|Oyster Bay]] from the Matinecock.  Later in that year he admitted four co-partners into the project: three Coles brothers,  Nathaniel, Daniel, and Robert; and Nicholas Simkins, all residents of Oyster Bay.  The five young men named the settlement ''Musketa'' Cove. In the [[Lenape]] language ''musketa'' meant “place of rushes.” The five men are considered the five original proprietors of Musketa Cove Plantation.&lt;ref name=Library&gt;Petrash, Antonia; Stern, Carol; McCrossen, Carol, [http://www.nassaulibrary.org/glencove/History%20of%20Glen%20Cove.html &quot;History of Glen Cove&quot;], Glen Cove Public Library, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1830s, [[steamboats]] started regular service on Long Island Sound between New York City and Musketa Cove, arriving at a point still called &quot;The Landing.&quot;  As &quot;Musketa&quot; was negatively associated with [[mosquito]], in 1834 village residents changed the name to Glen Cove (said to be the misheard suggestion &quot;Glencoe&quot;, after the [[Glen Coe|Scottish glen]]) now [[Glencoe, Scotland]].&lt;ref name=HOGC/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.longislandgenealogy.com/community.html#glencove |title=The History of Glen Cove, NY  |accessdate=October 13, 2008 |last=Henderson |first=Jeanne |work=Long Island Genealogy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The village added population as workers arrived for jobs at the Duryea Corn Starch factory, which operated until 1900. The name &quot;Duryea&quot; was once suggested as a village name to replace Mosquito Cove but rejected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epodunk.com/cgi-bin/genInfo.php?locIndex=738 &quot;Glen Cove Community Profile&quot;], Podunk&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1850 the village of Glen Cove had become a popular summer resort community for New York City residents.  The [[Long Island Railroad]] was extended to Glen Cove in 1867, providing quicker, more frequent service to New York City.  The availability of the train and the town's location on Long Island Sound made it attractive to year-round residents, and the population increased.&lt;ref name=Library/&gt; On June 8, 1917, Glen Cove became an independent city, separating from the Town of Oyster Bay after 250 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;HOGC&quot;/&gt;

The vistas afforded of Long Island Sound from the town's rolling hills attracted late 19th-century wealthy industrial barons, including [[Charles Pratt]] and his sons, [[J. P. Morgan]], and [[F. W. Woolworth]].  They built large private estates along the island's North Shore.  This expanse of settled wealth was part of what would become known in the 1920s as the [[North Shore (Long Island)|Gold Coast]]. Part of the Morgan property was donated to the city and is now Morgan Park and Beach.&lt;ref name=Library/&gt;

Most of the mansions were adapted to other purposes before the mid-20th century.  Winfield Hall, the former home of [[F.W. Woolworth]], is privately owned.  Altogether, five Pratt families owned about {{convert|5000|acre|km2}} in the area.  John T. Pratt's estate (&quot;The Manor,&quot; designed by [[Charles A. Platt]]) is now operated as the Glen Cove Mansion Hotel and Conference Center. The Braes, the country estate of his son [[Herbert L. Pratt]], was purchased by the [[Webb Institute]] in 1945. After renovation, it opened the facility in 1947 as an established specialty college for naval architecture and engineering.&lt;ref&gt;MacKay, Robert B. et al. (1997). ''Long Island Country Houses and Their Architects, 1860–1940'', Society for the Preservation of Long Island Antiquities. p 84&lt;/ref&gt; George DuPont Pratt's estate, [[Killenworth]], was purchased by the [[Soviet Union]] government for use by its [[United Nations]] delegation.  The Russians have used it for decades to house visitors and as a weekend retreat for its UN staff. When in the United States for meetings at the United Nations, both [[Nikita Khrushchev]], then premier of the Soviet Union, and [[Fidel Castro]], then president of [[Cuba]], separately stayed at Killenworth.

Like many other suburbs, Glen Cove grew rapidly in population after World War II, when new residential developments were completed that replaced pastureland and farms with subdivisions.  Many residents were second and third-generation descendants of eastern and southern European immigrants, and had moved out from childhood homes in Queens or Brooklyn. In the late 20th century, immigrants have come generally from [[Latin America]] and eastern Asia. A [[Sikh]] [[gurdwara]] established in Glen Cove draws from the ethnic East Asian population in the area.

The [[United States Post Office (Glen Cove, New York)|U.S. Post Office]] at Glen Cove was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1989, and the [[Justice Court Building]], the former city court and later city hall and police headquarters, was added in 1990.&lt;ref name=&quot;nris&quot;&gt;{{NRISref|2009a}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been acquired for renovation as the North Shore Historical Museum.

Glen Cove is twinned with [[Sturno]] (Italy).

==Waterfront==
[[File:Hempsted Harbour Yacht Club House c 1894.JPG|thumb|right|Hempstead Harbour Yacht Club House c 1894]]
The city of Glen Cove has an extensive waterfront area. Hempstead Harbour Yacht Club, Glen Cove City Yacht Club and the Garvies Point Boating Association are the three major sailing clubs in the City of Glen Cove. Brewer's Boardyard is the only boating storage yard left in the city. The city has a boat launch ramp at the end of  Garvies Point Road. The city has no facilities for kayaks.

Sailboat racing in the Glen Cove area can be watched from a cliff-top park in the neighboring village of Sea Cliff and from various points on the hills of Garvies Point Preserve. Races are Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday evenings, and Saturdays during the afternoon. The annual Around Long Island Sailboat Race finishes at the end of the breakwater at Morgan Park.

On the waterfront the saying goes, &quot;If you can hear the train, it is going to rain.&quot; If you hear that train whistle blow, that means the wind is coming from the east and a storm is on the way.

The site of the former Li Tungsten Plant on the creek in Glen Cove has been designated as a Superfund site, needing cleanup of hazardous wastes.

Clay was once mined along the creek and used to make piping for New York City.

The [[population]] was 18,141 at the 2010 census. The name derives from the [[Lackawanna Steel Company]].&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot;&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| title = History of the City of Lackawanna| work = Welcome to the City of Lackawanna Official Website| publisher =| date =| url = http://www.ci.lackawanna.ny.us/history.html| doi =| accessdate =3 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is part of the [[Buffalo-Niagara Falls metropolitan area]]. The city of Lackawanna is in the southwestern part of the county. It is part of the [[Southtowns]].

==Government==
The city of Lackawanna has a mayor-council form of government. A councilman is elected for each of the four wards of the city. The mayor and council president are elected at large. Fire and police services are also provided by city run departments.&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot;/&gt;

==History==

Originally part of the [[Buffalo Creek Reservation]], the area was not open to settlement until 1842 when the land was sold by the [[Seneca Indians]]. In 1851 the [[Administrative divisions of New York#Town|town]] of Seneca was formed, the name was changed to [[West Seneca]] in 1852, with the area now known as Lackawanna being called West Seneca or Limestone Hill.

Lackawanna was a center of [[steel]] manufacture throughout most of the 20th century. In 1899 all the land along the [[West Seneca]] shore of [[Lake Erie]] was purchased by the Lackawanna Steel Company. Construction was started in 1900 and the plant began operation in 1903. The [[Lackawanna Steel Company]] moved to the area in 1902 later, in 1909, the residents of the area voted to split off from West Seneca forming the city of Lackawanna.&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot;/&gt;

The Lackawanna Steel Company was acquired by the [[Bethlehem Steel]] Company in 1922. With the 20th century growth of the Bethlehem Steel plant, at one time the largest in the world, came the continued growth of the city and its institutions. At its peak the plant employed 20,000 people. It attracted people from many lands to settle here and make their homes. The history of one notable ethnic group (i.e., the Italians) in Lackawanna is documented in the 2009 publication &quot;The Italians of Lackawanna, NY: Steelworkers, Merchants and Gardians&quot; by John Andreozzi. In the latter half of the 20th century saw the decline of the steel plant and finally its closure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors = | title = Bethlehem Rejects Lackawanna Plan| work =| publisher = The New York Times| date = March 18, 1983

In recent years, efforts have been made to convert the former steel plant [[brownfields]] to other uses. The site does have a diversity of tenants, some occupy buildings remaining from the former steel plant and a few in newer buildings. These efforts have been opposed by many sectors, as the alleged contamination of the field has been said by some to have caused cancer and other medical issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = DePalma| first = Anthony| authorlink =| coauthors =David Staba NYT| title = Sickened, and Fighting Another Cold War| work = CCAM NEWS 2007 part 4| publisher = Mothball Millstone!

===Railroads===
[[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad]], originally the [[Lackawanna and Western Railroad]], operated from 1851 to 1960.  In 1960 it was consolidated with the [[Erie Railroad]] to become the [[Erie Lackawanna Railway]]. The Erie Lackawanna Railway operated from 1960 to 1976 until it was absorbed by [[Conrail]].

===Notable court case===
The city of Lackawanna was the defendant in the 1971 district court decision ''[[Kennedy-Park Homes Association v. City of Lackawanna]]''. This court decision forbade the municipal government (Lackawanna) from interfering with the construction of a low-income housing development in a predominantly white section of the city. It was decided that such action would amount to racial discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title =436 F. 2d 108 - Kennedy Park Homes Association v.

===The Lackawanna Six===
The [[Buffalo Six|Lackawanna Six]] (also known as the Buffalo Six) are a group of alleged [[Al-Qaida]] members, who were convicted of providing &quot;material support&quot; to Al-Qaida. The group was accused of traveling to [[Afghanistan]] and [[Pakistan]] in the spring of 2001 to attend terrorist training camps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Purdy |first = Matthew |coauthors = Lowell Bergman |title = WHERE THE TRAIL LED Unclear Danger: Inside the Lackawanna Terror Case |publisher = The New York Times |date = October 12, 2003 |url = http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/12/nyregion/12LACK.html?position=&amp;ei=5007&amp;en=6c72ae19117871d4&amp;ex=1381291200&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;partner=USERLAND&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;adxnnlx=1130180644-8piERM4UI408SpeT7oO5EA |accessdate = 2007-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they had claimed that their travel was to Pakistan only for the purpose of religious instruction.

The group was arrested in Lackawanna, September 13, 2002, by the FBI. A member of the Lackawanna Cell, [[Jaber A. Elbaneh]], never returned to the U.S. after his trip to Afghanistan. In September 2003 the FBI announced a $5 million reward for information leading to his arrest. He was captured by Yemen police and was convicted and sentenced to a prison in Yemen for involvement in the 2002 bombing of the French oil tanker ''Limburg'' off the coast of Yemen. The remaining members of the group pled guilty in December 2003 and were given various sentences in federal prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Aziz| first = Roya| authorlink =| coauthors = Monica Lam| title = Profiles: The Lackawanna Cell| work = Chasing the Sleeper Cell

Jaber Elbaneh escaped from a Yemeni prison in 2006 after joining a successful group prison break and was named as one of 23 people, 12 of them Al-Qaeda members, who escaped on February 3, 2006.On February 23, 2006 the U.S. FBI confirmed the escape, as they issued a national Press Release naming Elbaneh as one of the first new additions, since inception in 2001, to the [[FBI Most Wanted Terrorists]] list.&lt;ref name=&quot;fbi&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Recent Escapees from Yemen Prison Added to Most Wanted Terrorists and Seeking Information - War on Terrorism Lists|date=February 23, 2006|publisher= Federal Bureau of Investigation

The incident of the Lackawanna Six has tarnished the city's reputation, but it is recovering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Vezner |first = Tad |title = The lessons of Lackawanna: Terror case leaves lasting mark on New York town |publisher = The Toledo Blade.com |date = February 26, 2006 |url = http://www.toledoblade.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060226/NEWS08/602260378 |accessdate = 2007-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2009, it was reported that prior to sending in 130 federal and local members of the
Western New York Joint Terrorism Task Force it was suggested that [[United States army|federal troops]] be used to capture the suspects.&lt;ref name=&quot;buffalo&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = Michel| first = Lou| coauthors =| title = Lackawanna officials say troops in city was bad idea| work =| place =| pages =| publisher = The Buffalo News| date = July 26, 2009| url =http://www.buffalonews.com/home/story/744712.html| accessdate =27 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] and Defense Secretary [[Donald Rumsfeld]] felt that the men should be declared [[enemy combatants]] and could have been tried by a [[Guantanamo military commission|military tribunal]]. [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] rejected this proposal and the arrests proceeded without incident.&lt;ref name=&quot;buffalo&quot; /&gt;


==Religious institutions==
The city of Lackawanna is home to fourteen Protestant churches, the Masjid Alhuda Guidance Mosque (the largest mosque in the Buffalo area), ten Roman Catholic churches, one of which is Our Lady of Victory Basilica (OLV); and Saint Stephen Serbian Orthodox Church.

===Our Lady of Victory Basilica===
[[Image:Our Lady of Victory 2.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Our Lady of Victory Basilica]]
[[Our Lady of Victory Basilica (Lackawanna, New York)|Our Lady of Victory Basilica]], located in Lackawanna, is a National Shrine. Next to Our Lady of Victory (OLV) Basilica is Holy Cross Cemetery. It has been a parish  cemetery since 1849, although burials date back to 1830.
[[Father Nelson Baker]] was responsible for the building of working boy's home ([[protectory]]) in 1898. He also supervised construction of an infants' home in 1907, a maternity home in 1915, Our Lady of Victory Hospital in 1919, and the Basilica of Our Lady of Victory in 1926. Father Baker named the Basilica after the shrine of Notre Dame des Victoires in [[Paris]], [[France]], which he visited as a seminarian in 1874. He was in charge of the Basilica and the various institutions of charity until his death at 94, on July 29, 1936.

Father Baker's social programs have evolved into Baker Victory Services, which care for more than 2,500 children each day. Baker Victory Services Adoption Program has evolved into a renowned resource for a wide range of adoptive services. Their mission is to assist birth mothers, families and adoptees through the often complex and always emotional adoption process. Our Lady of Victory Hospital, closed in 1999, is being converted into senior housing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Thrall| first = Terese Hudson| authorlink =| coauthors =| title = Design &amp; Construction - Finding a New Use for an Old Hospital| work =| publisher = Hospital &amp; Health Networks| date = April 2007| url = http://www.hhnmag.com/hhnmag_app/jsp/articledisplay.jsp?dcrpath=HHNMAG/Article/data/04APR2007/0704HHN_InBox_Design&amp;domain=HHNMAG| doi =| accessdate =3 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =

In addition, the Catholic Church named Father Baker &quot;[[Servant of God]]&quot; in 1987, the first step towards declaring him a saint. In 1999, [[Father Nelson Baker]]'s remains were moved from Holy Cross Cemetery and re-interred inside the basilica. This was a recommended step for his [[canonization]] process. On January 14, 2011, Pope Benedict XVI approved a document of the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]] declaring Father Baker &quot;Venerable.&quot;  His cause for [[canonization]] continues under review by Vatican officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| title = The Road to Sainthood| work = Father Nelson Baker - The Apostle of Charity| publisher = Our Lady of Victory.org| date =| url = http://olvbvs.org/ourladyofvictory/FatherBaker/sainthood_flashcheck.htm

== History ==
[[Image:Bruce, William - Auburn, New York (1909).jpg|thumb|left|267px|''Auburn, New York,'' (1909), by William Bruce (1861-1911)]]
[[Image:State Street from Genesee Street, Auburn, NY.jpg|thumb|left|267px|State Street in 1910]]

The region around Auburn had been [[Iroquois]] territory for centuries before European contact and historical records.

Auburn was founded in 1793, during the post-Revolutionary period of settlement of western New York.  The founder, John L. Hardenbergh, was a veteran of the [[Sullivan Expedition|Sullivan-Clinton campaign]] against the Iroquois during the [[American Revolution]].  Hardenbergh settled in the vicinity of the [[Owasco River]] with his infant daughter and two African-American slaves, Harry and Kate Freeman.  After his death in 1806, Hardenbergh was buried in Auburn's North Street Cemetery, and was re-interred in 1852 in Fort Hill Cemetery&amp;nbsp;– the first burial in the city's newly-opened burial ground.  The community grew up around Hardenbergh's [[gristmill]] and [[sawmill]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tourauburnny.com/visitor-history-tours-auburn.asp Historical &amp; Cultural Auburn, New York]&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally known as Hardenbergh's Corners in the town of [[Aurelius, New York|Aurelius]], the settlement was renamed Auburn in 1805 when it became the county seat.  It became an incorporated village in 1815, and was chartered as a city in 1848. It was only a few miles from the [[Erie Canal]], which opened in 1825 and allowed local factories to inexpensively ship goods north or south. In 1871, the Southern Central Railroad, financed by the [[Lehigh Valley Railroad]], completed a line primarily to carry [[anthracite coal|coal]] from [[Athens, Pennsylvania]], through Auburn to [[wharf|wharves]] on [[Lake Ontario]] at [[Fair Haven, New York|Fair Haven]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lvrrhs.org/history/index.htm Lehigh Valley Railroad Historical Society]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1818 to 1939, Auburn was home to [[Auburn Theological Seminary]], once one of the preeminent theological seminaries in the United States.  In 1939, facing financial difficulties as a result of the [[Great Depression]], the seminary moved to the campus of [[Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York|Union Theological Seminary]] in [[New York City]].  The only building from the Auburn Theological Seminary that stands today is [[Willard Memorial Chapel]] and the adjacent Welch Memorial Hall on Nelson Street, designed by [[Andrew Jackson Warner]] of [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], with [[stained-glass]] windows and interior decoration by [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]].  It is the only complete, unaltered Tiffany chapel interior known to exist.

In 1816, [[Auburn Prison]] (now the [[Auburn Correctional Facility]]) was founded as a model for the contemporary ideas about treating prisoners, known now as the [[Auburn System]]. Visitors were charged a fee for viewing the facility and its inmates. On August 6, 1890, the first [[Execution (legal)|execution]] by the [[electric chair]] was carried out at Auburn Prison.  Also, in 1901 [[Leon Czolgosz]], assassin of [[William McKinley|President William McKinley]], was executed there. Although the ideas of the Auburn System have been abandoned, the prison continues to serve as a maximum security facility, and is one of the most secure prisons in the continental United States.

== Geography and climate ==
Auburn is located at the north end of [[Owasco Lake]], one of the [[Finger Lakes]], which is drained by the [[Owasco Outlet]]&amp;nbsp;– also known as the [[Owasco River]]&amp;nbsp;– which runs north through the city.  A dam, owned and operated by the city, controls the outflow of the lake, which is used for drinking water and recreation.  The city is required is keep a sufficient amount of water in the river to deal with the effluent from its waste disposal treatment facility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findlakes.com/owasco_lake_new-york~ny00776.htm &quot;Oasco Lake, Central New York&quot;] on FindLakes.com&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|8.4|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|8.4|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|0.04|sqmi|km2}}, or 0.47%, is water.

[[U.S. Route 20 in New York|US 20]] is an important east-west highway passing through the city, and [[New York State Route 34]] and [[New York State Route 38]] are north-south highways that intersect US-20 in Auburn.

=== Professional baseball ===
Auburn has had a long association with [[professional baseball]]:

==== National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues ====
In late 1901, Auburn became the headquarters of the [[National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues]] (NAPBL), which is now known simply as [[Minor League Baseball]] and based in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]]. John H. Farrell, who served as secretary-treasurer of the league for many years, was a local resident, and the league's offices remained in the city while he remained in that role.

==== Auburn Community Baseball ====
[[Auburn Community Baseball]], which is owned by the City of Auburn, is the parent organization of the [[Auburn Doubledays]] and its predecessor Auburn entries in the Class A short-season [[New York-Penn League]] dating back to 1958. The team plays its home games at [[Falcon Park|Leo Pinckney Field at Falcon Park]], and is an affiliate of the [[Washington Nationals]].

Possibly the two best-known historical figures associated with Auburn are [[William H. Seward]] and [[Harriet Tubman]].

Seward&amp;nbsp;– who served as a [[New York Senate|New York state senator]], the [[governor of New York]], a [[United States Senate|U.S. senator]], a presidential candidate, and then [[Secretary of State]] under presidents [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[Andrew Johnson]], in which role he negotiated the 1867 purchase from [[Russia]] of [[Alaska]], which became known as &quot;Seward's Folly&quot;&amp;nbsp;– lived in Auburn from 1823 until his death in 1872, and was opposed to slavery.  In 1859 he sold a plot of land to [[abolitionist]] Tubman, who used it to create a  safe haven for her family and friends and other black Americans seeking a better life in the north.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kate Larson|Larson, Kate Clifford]] (2004).

'''New Rochelle''' is a [[Political subdivisions of New York State#City|city]] in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]], [[New York]], [[United States]], in the southeastern portion of the state.

The town was settled by refugee [[Huguenots]] (French Protestants) in 1688 who were fleeing persecution (such as [[dragonnade]]) in France . Many of the settlers were artisans and craftsmen from the city of [[La Rochelle]], [[France]], thus [[List of U.S. place names of French origin|influencing the choice of the name]] of &quot;New Rochelle.&quot;

In 2007, the city had a population of 73,260, making it the seventh largest in the state of [[New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.census.gov/popest/cities/files/SUB-EST2007-36.csv | title = Subcounty population estimates: New York 2000-2007| format = [[comma-separated values|CSV]] | publisher = [[United States Census Bureau]], Population Division | date = 2009-03-18 | accessdate = 2009-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of the 2010 Census, the city's population had increased to 77,062. In 2008, New Rochelle was recognized by the American Podiatric Medical Association (APMA) as one of the 100 Best Walking Cities in America, and the second best in New York State next only to nearby New York City.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prevention.com/bestcities Best Walking Cities Finder&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2008 ''[[Business Week]]'' magazine listed New Rochelle as the best city in New York State, and one of the best places nationally, to raise children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://images.businessweek.com/ss/08/11/1110_best_places_for_kids/33.htm The Best Places to Raise Kids 2009] accessdate=2008-11-24&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of New Rochelle, New York}}

===17th century===
[[File:01 Jacob Leisler.JPG|thumb|Statue of [[Jacob Leisler]]]]
Some 33 families established the community of ''la Nouvelle-Rochelle'' in 1688. A monument containing the names of these settlers stands in Hudson Park, the original landing point of the Huguenots.&lt;ref&gt;Historical Landmarks of New Rochelle, Morgan Seacord 1938 pg.6&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty-one years earlier, the [[Siwanoy]] Indians sold their land to [[Thomas Pell]]. In 1689 Pell officially deeded 6,100 acres (25&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) for the establishment of a Huguenot community.&lt;ref&gt;''New York - A Guide to The Empire State'', [[Work Projects Administration]] of New York pg.245&lt;/ref&gt; Jacob Leisler is an important figure in the early histories of both New Rochelle and the nation. He arrived in America as a [[mercenary]] in the [[British army]] and later became one of the most prominent merchants in New York. He was subsequently appointed acting-governor of the province, and it was during this time that he acted on behalf of the [[Huguenots]].&lt;ref&gt;History of Westchester County, New York, J. Thomas Scharf, A.M., LL.D., p688&lt;/ref&gt;

Of all the Huguenot settlements in America founded with the view of being distinct French colonies, New Rochelle most clearly conformed to the plans of its founders. The colony continued to attract French refugees until as late as 1760. The choice of name for the city reflected the importance of the city of La Rochelle and of the new settlement in Huguenot history and distinctly French character of the community. [[French language|French]] was spoken, and it was common practice for people in neighboring areas to send their children to New Rochelle to learn the language.&lt;ref&gt;Historical Landmarks of New Rochelle, Morgan H. Seacord and William S. Hadaway, pg.94&lt;/ref&gt;

===18th century===
[[File:01 Thomas Paine.JPG|thumb|Thomas Paine Memorial]]
In 1775, General [[George Washington]] stopped in New Rochelle on his way to assume command of the Army of the [[Thirteen Colonies|United Colonies]] in Massachusetts.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;&gt;[http://www.newrochelleny.com/182.asp New Rochelle On-line&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The British Army briefly occupied sections of New Rochelle and Larchmont in 1776. Following British victory in the [[Battle of White Plains]], New Rochelle became part of a &quot;Neutral Ground&quot; for General Washington to regroup his troops.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot; /&gt; After the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] ended in 1784, patriot [[Thomas Paine]] was given a farm in New Rochelle for his service to the cause of independence. The farm, totaling about 300 acres (1.2&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), had been confiscated from its owners by state of New York due to their Tory activities.

The first national census of 1790 shows New Rochelle with 692 residents, 136 of whom were [[African American]], including 36 who were [[Freeman (Colonial)|freemen]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20040219214807/http://www.newrochelleny.com/183.asp Archive of &quot;New Rochelle On-line&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th century===
Through the 18th century, New Rochelle had remained a modest village that retained an abundance of agricultural land. During the 19th century, however, with the rapid growth of New York City by [[immigration]] principally from Ireland and Germany, more American families left New York City and moved into the area. Although the original Huguenot population was rapidly shrinking in relative size, through ownership of land, businesses, banks, and small manufactures, they retained a predominant hold on the political and social life of the town.

The 1820 Census showed 150 [[African-Americans]] residing in New Rochelle, six of whom were [[slave]]s. In 1857 the Village of New Rochelle was established within the borders of the Town of New Rochelle. A group of volunteers created the first fire service in 1861. In 1899, a bill creating the New Rochelle [[Municipal charter|City Charter]] was signed by Governor [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. It was through this bill that the Village and Town of New Rochelle were joined into one municipality. In 1899, Michael J. Dillon narrowly defeated Hugh A. Harmer to become New Rochelle's first [[mayor]]. The recently established city charter designated four wards, a board of alderman (two from each ward), and 10 elected from the city at large.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newrochelleny.com/200.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th and 21st centuries===
[[File:New Rochelle Map 1918.JPG|thumb|right|Map of New Rochelle in 1918]]
By 1900 New Rochelle had a population of 14,720.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newrochelleny.com/20.asp New Rochelle Online - History:20th Century]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1904, plans were completed for [[Rochelle Park (New Rochelle)|Rochelle Park]], one of the first [[planned communities]] in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE7DD133AF937A15756C0A961948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=2 If You're Thinking of Living in: NEW ROCHELLE], New York Times, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; In 1909, [[Edwin Thanhouser]] established [[Thanhouser Film Corporation]]. Thanhouser's ''[[Million Dollar Mystery]]'' was one of the first serial motion pictures.&lt;ref&gt;The Thanhouser Company of New Rochelle, a Dossier;Author=Anthony Slide;Published=1974&lt;/ref&gt; In 1923, New Rochelle resident Anna Jones became the first [[African American]] woman to be admitted to the New York State Bar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newrochelleny.com/202.asp New Rochelle Online - History:20th Century]&lt;/ref&gt;

Poet and resident [[James J. Montague]] captured the image of New Rochelle in his 1926 poem &quot;Queen City of the Sound&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;New Rochelle The City of Huguenots&quot;; The City of New Rochelle - Chamber of Commerce;1926, The Knickerbocker Press, New Rochelle, NY&lt;/ref&gt; The last four lines of the poem are:

:''When Nature, seeking upon men''
::''To cast a magic spell,''
:''She looked the world around - and then''
::''She fashioned New Rochelle.''
|author=James J. Montague}}

In 1930, New Rochelle recorded a population of 54,000, up from 36,213 only ten years earlier. During the 1930s, New Rochelle was the wealthiest city per capita in New York state and the third wealthiest in the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;newrochelleny.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.newrochelleny.com/203.asp New Rochelle Online - History:20th Century]&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the century, the City had begun a massive revitalization of its 'downtown'. In 1999, part of downtown New Rochelle near the [[Metro-North Railroad|Metro North]] [[train station]] was rebuilt with a $190 million entertainment complex, nicknamed [[New Roc City]], which features a 19-screen [[movie theater]], an [[IMAX]] theater, an indoor [[Ice hockey|ice-hockey]] arena, [[Miniature golf|mini-golf]], go karts, an arcade, restaurants, a [[hotel]], loft-apartments and a mega [[supermarket]]. The complex was built on the former [[Macy's]] and Mall which had opened in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allbusiness.com/operations/facilities-commercial-real-estate/325732-1.html New Roc City complex opens in New Rochelle], AllBusiness, September 29, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

===Residential profile===
New Rochelle is commonly referred to as 'The Home Town' because of the significant amount of single-family, residential development that exists throughout most of the city. While the formerly industrial [[downtown]] section is more densely developed, with condominiums, high rises, offices, [[Shopping mall|shopping centers]], affordable housing complexes, a medical center, [[nursing home]]s, two college campuses and an inter modal transportation hub, the rest of the city consists of sprawling, residential neighborhoods. There are more than 11,500 single family units within the city, more than that of neighboring Larchmont, Mamaroneck and Scarsdale combined. The total number of separate households surpasses 26,000, more than that of neighboring [[Pelham (town), New York|Pelham]], [[Pelham Manor]], [[Eastchester]], [[Scarsdale]], [[Mamaroneck (village), New York|Mamaroneck]] and [[Larchmont]] combined.

====Housing variety====
Some of the country's most expensive [[real estate]] can be found in [[New Rochelle]]. The north end of the city (10804) is ranked in [[Forbes]] Magazines list of the '500 most expensive zip-codes' in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.forbes.com/lists/2006/7/ZIP10804.html | work=Forbes | title=10804, Most Expensive ZIP Codes 2006 - Forbes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the list, the average [[household income]] was $199,061 and the average home price was over $752,000. Homes in Premium Point, a gated section of the city on [[Long Island Sound]], are priced anywhere from $2 to $20 million. The three newest residential developments, 'Kensington Woods', 'The Greens at Cherry Lawn' and 'Riviera Shores', are all [[Gated community|gated communities]] with [[Single-family home|single family homes]] priced from $2 million. With a population approaching 80,000 residents, [[New York]] State law dictates that the city provide an adequate amount of [[affordable housing]] units for the less fortunate. New Rochelle has historically met and surpassed state requirements, currently working to replace the existing Weyman Avenue Projects with more forward thinking, community centered townhouse-style housing units. By embracing the needs of the poor, New Rochelle sets a precedent for other suburban communities to follow. Neighboring towns including Mamaroneck, Larchmont and Scarsdale neglect to address such concerns, failing to meet the minimal affordable housing requirements set by the state. Popular consensus is that the presence of the poor precludes that of the [[Middle class|middle-class]] and the wealthy. Considering the large number of [[Working class|working-class]] and affordable housing units found 'Downtown', the high property values prevalent throughout most of the city reflects the true economic diversity of New Rochelle. It is home to the financially disadvantaged and the very wealthy. One of 'the wealthiest people in the United States' according to [[Forbes Magazine]] was longtime New Rochelle resident and businessman [[Sidney Frank]].

====Communities====

King George III gave Trinity its first charter in 1762. After the Revolutionary War, Trinity became a parish of the Protestant Episcopal Church of America.

====Railroad history====
{{See also2|[[History of New Rochelle, New York#Railroad history|Railroad history of New Rochelle]]}}
By 1848, the New York &amp; New Haven opened their line along Long Island Sound. After the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], proposals for new railroads reached new levels. Banking that the city would continue to grow northward, the [[New York, Westchester and Boston Railway]] Company was established to serve the large populations moving to the suburbs. Two main lines were built as part of the NYW&amp;B; the Port Chester line and the [[White Plains, New York|White Plains]] line. While the populations of some communities served by the NYW&amp;B did grow between 1912 and 1937, the growth was not sufficient or fast enough to provide adequate business for the railroad, and service was discontinued on December 31, 1937.

'''Oneida''' is a [[city]] in [[Madison County, New York|Madison County]] located west of [[Oneida Castle, New York|Oneida Castle]] (in [[Oneida County, New York|Oneida County]]) and east of [[Canastota]], New York, [[United States]]. The population was 11,390 at the 2010 census. The city, like both Oneida County and the nearby silver and china maker, takes its name from the [[Oneida tribe]]. Some members of the tribe are still concentrated in the municipal vicinity.

==History==
Both the construction of the Erie canal feeder and the railroad stop, led to the incorporation of the Village of Oneida on June 20, 1848. The village was part of the huge Town of Lenox. Years of friction among different sections of the large Town led to the establishment of a new Town of Oneida in 1896. This town, in turn, was chartered as the City of Oneida on March 28, 1901.

==Geography==
Oneida is located at {{Coord|43|5|6|N|75|39|12|W|type:city}} (43.084961, -75.653375).{{GR|1}} The city is located between [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]] and [[Utica, New York|Utica]].

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|22.1|sqmi|km2}}, of which, {{convert|22.0|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and {{convert|0.1|sqmi|km2}} of it (0.23%) is water.

Oneida is centrally placed between Montreal, Toronto, Buffalo, Boston, and New York City; is one hour from the Adirondacks; and is just southeast of Oneida Lake, the largest lake entirely within New York

==Urban planning==
The city of Oneida is a good example of pre-war city design. Urban planning makes it pedestrian-focused and bicycle-friendly. With public buildings, parks, and private residences well-mingled and within walking and biking distance, the city is gaining popularity with telecommuters who can choose where they live without the constraints of job location. Most residents of the city core are within walking distance to elementary schools, church activities. Recently, there has been renewed interest for increased [[cycling infrastructure|bicycle infrastructure]], especially a revitalization of the disused light rail pathways that ring the city's south and north side for multi-use by cyclists and recreation, and as a gateway to and from the inner and outer area retail districts. {{Verify source|date=January 2012}}

Oneida benefits from having several post secondary academies within commuting distance including [[Colgate University]], [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]], the [[State University of New York Institute of Technology]], [[Syracuse University]], [[Le Moyne College]], [[Mohawk Valley Community College]], [[Cazenovia College]], the [[State University of New York at Morrisville]], and [[Utica College]].  

Recreational waterways such as the Erie Canal and Oneida Creek are located on the perimeter of the city limits.  City parks are distributed throughout the city, with the exception of the rural Mount Hope Reservoir park.  Oneida has 10 public tennis courts, seven of them lit, and more than {{convert|100|acre|ha}} of public space used for organized youth sports, fishing, hiking, mountain biking, cross country skiing, and a winter ice skating rink. Oneida is centrally located on the New York State Canalway Trail System, a network of more than {{convert|260|mi|km}} of existing multi-use, recreational trails across upstate New York, with major segments adjacent to the waterways of the New York State Canal System.   The Main-Broad-Grove Streets area was classified a historic district in 1983. The Oneida Community Mansion House is highlighted in the Madison County Architectural Heritage Trail.

The city government consists of a mayor who is elected at large and six council members who are elected from one of six wards. Each ward elects one member.

== Facts about Oneida ==
Oneida is located near the site of the former [[Oneida Community]], a social and religious experiment that flourished during the third quarter of the 19th Century. The [[Oneida Community Mansion House]], a national historic monument, is the principal building of the Oneida Community.  The international tableware company [[Oneida Limited]], founded 1880, is still headquartered in the city, although all US manufacturing operations have now ceased and all Oneida products are imported. The current mayor of Oneida, NY is Max Smith.

Oneida is also the home of the world's smallest church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7266966/ America's smallest roadside churches], MSNBC, 10 July 2006, (accessed 31 December 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; 

Oneida was formerly known as Oneida Depot. In the nineteenth century its residents were among the closest neighbors to a utopian socialist commune, set up by [[John Humphrey Noyes]], lasting from 1848 until 1881. This commune, called the [[Oneida Community]], produced silk and canned goods until the manufacturing of flatware picked up in the later years of the Community's existence. This would lead to the foundation of Oneida Limited, a company which survived the Community and became one of America's most important flatware producers in the twentieth century.

Oneida was featured in the storyline of the television show &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;(Episode 250- &quot;Brother's Keeper&quot;), in which an Irish-American Mafia informant for the FBI takes refuge at the Oneida home of his twin brother, who is a teacher at a local university.

Oneida has a number of properties on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] including: the [[Main-Broad-Grove Streets Historic District]], [[Cottage Lawn]], [[DeFerriere House]], [[Mount Hope Reservoir]], [[Oneida Armory]], [[Oneida Community Mansion House]], and [[United States Post Office (Oneida, New York)|United States Post Office]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nris&quot;&gt;{{NRISref|version=2010a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peekskill''' is a city in [[Westchester County, New York]]. It is situated on a bay along the east side of the [[Hudson River]], across from [[Jones Point, New York|Jones Point]].

This community was known to be an early American industrial center, primarily for its iron plow and stove products. The Binney &amp; Smith Company, now makers of [[Crayola]] products, started as the Peekskill Chemical Company at Annsville in 1864.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Peekskill's manufacturing base operated well into the late 20th century, with the [[Fleischmann’s Yeast|Fleischmann Company]] making yeast by-products under the [[Standard Brands]] corporate name.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

The population is 23,583 according to the 2010 [[census]].

The well-publicized [[Peekskill Riots]] of 1949, involving the [[Civil Rights Congress]] benefit concert of [[Paul Robeson]], specifically occurred in the neighboring suburb Van Cortlandtville.&lt;ref&gt;Ford, Carin T. ''Paul Robeson:I Want to Make Freedom Ring'',pg.97 Chapter9 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In September 1609, [[Henry Hudson]], captain of the [[Halve Maen (ship)|Halve Maen]], anchored along the reach of the Hudson at Peekskill.  His firstmate noted in the ship's log that it was a &quot;very pleasant place to build a town&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation   | last = Sandler   | first = Corey   | title =  Henry Hudson Dreams and Obsession   | place =    | publisher = Citadel Press   | year = 2007   | volume =    | edition =    | url =    | doi =    | id =    | isbn = 978-0=8065-2739-0   | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the establishment of the province of [[New Netherland]], [[New Amsterdam]] resident Jan Peeck made the first recorded contact with the [[Lenape]] people of this area, then identified as &quot;Sachoes&quot;. The date is not certain, (possibly early 1640s), but agreements and merchant transactions took place, formalized in the Ryck's Patent Deed of 1684. The name &quot;Peekskill&quot; derives from a combination of Mr. Peek's surname and the [[Dutch (language)|Dutch]] word for stream, &quot;kil&quot; or &quot;kill&quot;.

European style settlement took place slowly in the early 18th century. By the time of the [[American Revolution]], the tiny community was an important manufacturing center from its various mills along the several creeks and streams. These industrial activities were attractive to the [[Continental Army]] in establishing its headquarters here in 1776.

The mills of Peek's Creek provided gunpowder, leather, planks, and flour. Slaughterhouses were important for food supply. The river docks allowed transport of supply items and soldiers to the several other fort garrisons placed to prevent British naval passage between [[Albany, New York|Albany]] and [[New York City]]. Officers at Peekskill generally supervised placing the first iron link chain between Bear Mountain and [[Anthony's Nose (Westchester)|Anthony's Nose]] in the spring of 1777.

Though Peekskill's terrain and mills were beneficial to the Patriot cause, they also made tempting targets for British raids. The most damaging attack took place in early spring of 1777, when an invasion force of a dozen vessels led by a warship and supported by infantry overwhelmed the American defenders. Another British operation in October 1777 led to further destruction of industrial apparatus. As a result, the Hudson Valley command for the Continental Army moved from Peekskill to [[West Point]], where it stayed for the remainder of that war.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

[[Image:South Street, Peekskill, NY.jpg|thumb|right|South Street in 1908]]
Peekskill's first legal [[Municipal corporation|incorporation]] of 1816 was reactivated in 1826 when Village elections took place. The Village was further incorporated within the [[Cortlandt, New York|Town of Cortlandt]] in 1849 and remained so until separating as a city in 1940.

Peekskill was the landing point of a fragment of the [[Peekskill Meteorite]], just before midnight on October 9, 1992. The meteoric trail was recorded on film by at least sixteen individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap061119.html|title=Astronomy Picture of the Day: 2006 November 19 - The Car, the Hole, and the Peekskill Meteorite|accessdate=2010-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was only the fourth meteorite in history for which an exact orbit is known. The rock had a mass of 12.4&amp;nbsp;kg (27.3&amp;nbsp;lb) and punched through the trunk of Peekskill resident Michelle Knapp's automobile upon impact.

The ''Peekskill Evening Star'' was the city's daily newspaper, publishing under various mastheads from the 19th century on, and as the ''Evening Star'' from 1939 till 1985 when the paper folded into what would become the nexus of the ''Journal News'', a conglomeration of local papers from throughout Westchester County.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nywcgs/wcgsrs10.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Journal News'' focused more on statewide and New York City issues, however, which led to the founding of the ''Peekskill Herald'' in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa5278/is_199811/ai_n24339292/ | work=Westchester County Business Journal | title=New owner has ambitious plans for Peekskill Herald | year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although numerous prominent citizens came together to try to keep the paper afloat after a series of [[New York Times]] articles about the paper's foundering fiscal situation, it 'folded in 2005, being replaced by the ''Peekskill Daily'' in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://peekskilldaily.com The Peekskill Daily.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://connection.ebscohost.com/content/article/1031693639.html;jsessionid=30E22F2793549810263D60D845F24BB4.ehctc1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/08/nyregion/paper-fights-to-stay-alive.html?pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | title=Paper Fights To Stay Alive | first=Claudia | last=Rowe | date=1997-06-08 | accessdate=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
The Centennial Firehouse, built in 1890, was located under a [[U.S. Route 9]] bridge.  During the original construction of the bridge in 1932 part of the roof of the firehouse was removed.  As part of a highway reconstruction project it was to be relocated to a new historic district.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/10/nyregion/nyregionspecial2/10firehousewe.html | A Peekskill Firehouse on the Move, The New York Times, August 9, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  The city spent $150,000 in grant money in preparing the building.  Unfortunately a mechanical failure during a turn caused the building to collapse&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lohud.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080821/NEWS/808210453 | Historic Peekskill firehouse collapses in move, lohud.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==

===School District===
The Peekskill City School District was headed by Superintendent Judith Johnson, the 2008 New York State School Superintendent of the Year, up until 2011. The current superintendent is Lorenzo Licopoli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.westchestermagazine.com/Westchester-Magazine/April-2008/Final-Say-Judith-Johnson/| work=Westchester Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of four elementary schools, one middle school, and one high school. The elementary schools operated on a &quot;neighborhood&quot; basis until 1999. Beginning the 1995-1996 school year, sixth graders were moved from elementary schools to the middle school. Until the 1998-1999 school year, each student attended the school closest to his or her home, beginning in kindergarten and ending with graduation from fifth grade. In 1999, the elementary schools were integrated, each school housing two grades. In 2009, the newly built Peekskill Middle School caused a shift in the locations of grades yet again and consequently moved grades one through five around. The high school serves grades nine through twelve.

====Elementary schools====
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2009}}
* The Uriah Hill, Jr. School housed the district's [[Early Childhood Education]] program. The ECC consisted of a pre-school and a kindergarten program. The Uriah Hill, Jr. school was located at 980 Pemart Avenue. As of September 2009, Uriah Hill School closed due to the consolidation of grades in other schools and as a way to cut back due to the economic setback that the whole country is facing.

* Oakside Elementary School caters to the district's second and third graders. The school is located at 200 Decatur Avenue.

* Woodside Elementary School houses the district's Pre-kindergarten program, kindergarten and first grade. It is located on Depew Street.

* Hillcrest Elementary School educates the district's fourth and fifth grades. It is located at 4 Horton Drive.

====Secondary schools====
* Peekskill Middle School educates the district's sixth, seventh, and eighth graders. The new Middle School building opened at the beginning of the 2009-2010 school year. It is located on Washington Street, directly behind the old building. The former Peekskill Middle School was located at 212 Ringgold Street, which was later demolished.

* [[Peekskill High School]] educates most of the district's ninth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth graders. The high school is located on the grounds of the original [[Peekskill Military Academy]] at 1072 Elm Street.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}  For the second consecutive year, Peekskill High School is listed on ''Newsweek'''s 2008 Washington Post Challenge Index of the top high schools in the nation.  This year, the school ranked in the top 5% of all high schools nationally based on the ratio of graduating seniors and students taking Advanced Placement Tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://projects.washingtonpost.com/challengeindex/2008/ | work=The Washington Post | deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peekskill is about {{convert|40|mi|km}} north of New York City. In the early 1990s, the population was dwindling and the downtown area was becoming more vacant. The Common Council decided to make artist studios and galleries an important part of the City's revitalization strategy.

The city wanted to turn its unused downtown spaces into something useful. Similar to Lowell, MA's strategy, in order to have a vibrant downtown area one must have a population living there, so that the activity does not only happen from nine to five. In creating spaces where artists both live and work, the city created a situation in which there would always be people downtown, 24 hours a day.

At the same time, the Common Council wanted to get people into downtown Peekskill, rising real estate prices in New York City were driving artists to move further away from even the boroughs outside Manhattan. Peekskill took an active role in pursuing displaced artists by taking out advertisements in So Ho art magazines and offering them low interest rates. This helped artists buy buildings and convert them into useful spaces. Once a few artists had moved to Peekskill, a buzz was created and more artists made the move north.

As an economic development incentive, landlords can be offered tax incentives, grants, facade improvements, and loans to renovate buildings that can be used as live-work spaces by artists.

Since 1991, property owners have 58 artist live/work lofts and in 2002, the City of Peekskill and the County of Westchester joined with a private real estate company to development The Peekskill Art Lofts.  This 28 unit coop offered artist an opportunity for affordable home ownership.

Peekskill has drawn a number of artists and art appreciators to its environs recently. Local highlights include Paramount Center for the Arts (www.paramountcenter.org), a restored 1930 movie palace which now serves as the area's cultural hub with music, comedy, drama and independent films. In the fall of 2012, the Paramount suspended operations while dealing with funding issues. Other highlights include the Hudson Valley Center for Contemporary Art, STUDIO No.9 Gallery and Workshops, and the Peekskill Coffee House, which showcases local acts.  The Bean Runner Cafe, on South Division Street,  and 12 Grapes,on North Division Street, also showcase local artists and musicians.

==Popular culture==
On the popular 1980s sitcom ''[[The Facts of Life (TV series)|The Facts of Life]]'', Peekskill was the location of two fictional educational institutions: Eastland School for Girls and Langley College.  Also located in the fictional version of Peekskill were the shops Edna's Edibles and Over Our Heads, therefore making the town the setting for most of the action on the series.

The city is also known as &quot;the Arsenal City&quot;.

== History ==
The explorer [[Henry Hudson]] arrived in the area of Watervliet around 1609. The area was first settled in 1643 as part of the [[Rensselaerswyck]] [[patroonship]], under the direction of [[Kiliaen van Rensselaer (Dutch merchant)|Kiliaen van Rensselaer]]. In 1710, Derrick van der Heyden operated a ferry from the Bleeker Farm (near 16th Street) across the Hudson River to Troy. Troops during the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] used this ferry in 1777 on their way to Bemis Heights and [[Stillwater, New York|Stillwater]] for the [[Battle of Saratoga]]. In 1786, a second ferry was started at Ferry Street (today 14th Street) over to Troy.&lt;ref name=History&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.archive.org/stream/historyofcityofw00myer/historyofcityofw00myer_djvu.txt | author = James T. Myers | publisher = Henry Stowell &amp; Son | title = History of the City of Watervliet: 1630–1910 | accessdate = 2009-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Watervliet (town), New York|town of Watervliet]] was founded in 1788 and included all of present-day Albany County except what was in the city of [[Albany, New York|Albany]] at the time. Because so many towns had been created from the town of Watervliet, it is regarded as the &quot;[[Timeline of town creation in New York's Capital District|mother of towns]]&quot; in the county.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} In 1816, as the first [[post office]] was erected, corner of River and Ferry streets (Broadway and 14th Street), it took the name Watervliet.&lt;ref name=History/&gt;

[[File:West troy1866.jpeg|left|thumb|West Troy in 1866]]
The location of the future city was taken by the [[Administrative divisions of New York#Village|village]] of Gibbonsville (1824) and its successor West Troy, and the [[Administrative divisions of New York#Hamlet|hamlet]] of Washington (later Port Schuyler).&lt;ref name=Bi&gt;{{cite book | title = Bi-centennial History of County of Albany, 1609–1886 | author = George Howell | pages = 974–993 | accessdate = 2009-04-05 | publisher = W.W. Munsell &amp; Company | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=XP9OXSEvvkYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=bi-centennial++history+of+county+of+albany}}&lt;/ref&gt; The farm owned by John Bleeker, stretching north from Buffalo Street (Broadway and 15th Street) to the farm owned by the Oothout family near 25th Street was purchased by Philip Schuyler, Isais Warren, Richard P. Hart, Nathan Warren, and others in 1823; they named it West Troy. Gibbonsville was the farm of James Gibbons (which he purchased in 1805), which stretched from North Street (8th Street) to Buffalo Street (15th Street).&lt;ref name=History/&gt; Washington was settled sometime before 1814 and was the area south of Gibbonsville and today the area of Watervliet south of the Arsenal; it became known as Port Schuyler in 1827.&lt;ref name=Bi/&gt; Although Gibbonsville and West Troy sat side by side (West Troy lying on Gibbonsville's northern boundary), there was a rivalry between the two and each named and laid out their streets with no regard to the street names and grids of the other.&lt;ref name=Bi/&gt; In 1824 Gibbonsville became incorporated as a village, and in 1836 this was repealed when West Troy became incorporated as a village including Gibbonsville and Port Schuyler;&lt;ref name=Bi/&gt; and in 1847 the Watervliet post office changed its name to West Troy.&lt;ref name=Vicinity/&gt; In 1830, Gibbonsville had 559 people, West Troy 510, and Port Schuyler 450.&lt;ref name=Vicinity/&gt;

In 1865, present-day Watervliet was included in the [[Capital District#Origin of the name|Capital Police Force]] within the Troy District. This attempt at regional consolidation of municipal police failed and in 1870 the West Troy Police Force was organized.&lt;ref name=History/&gt;
 
By 1895, what was known as the town of Watervliet was reduced to the present-day city of Watervliet (village of West Troy at the time), town of [[Colonie, New York|Colonie]], and the village/town of [[Green Island, New York|Green Island]]. Colonie would split off in 1895, and the city of Watervliet was incorporated in 1896 at the same time that Green Island became a town of its own.

In the early 19th century Watervliet became a major manufacturing community much like its neighbors [[Cohoes, New York|Cohoes]] and Troy, thanks to bell foundries. The first was located on Water Street (Broadway), between 14th and 15th Streets, by Julius Hanks, and the first bell foundry in Gibbonsville was established in 1826 by Andrew Menelly, Sr.&lt;ref name=History/&gt; This would be the genesis of the [[Meneely Bell Foundry]], which made thousands of bells that are still in use today from [[Iowa]] to the [[Czech Republic]].

[[File:Watervliet Arsenal museum.GIF|thumb|left|Historic [[Iron Building (Watervliet Arsenal)|Iron Building]] at Watervliet Arsenal]]
In 1813, the [[U.S. Federal Government]] purchased from James Gibbons {{convert|12|acre|m2}} in Gibbonsville, in 1828 another {{convert|30|acre|m2}}, along with later purchases from S. S. Wandell and others.&lt;ref name=History/&gt; This land was used as the site for the [[Watervliet Arsenal]], founded in 1813 during the [[War of 1812]], it is the oldest Federal [[arsenal]] in the country; and is the sole manufacturing facility for large caliber [[cannon]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} [[John C. Heenan]], U.S. heavyweight boxing champion and contender for the world title in 1860, was once employed at the Arsenal.&lt;ref name=History/&gt;
 
The main route of the [[Erie Canal]] from [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] to Albany ran through Watervliet, and because the canal bypassed the city of Troy, the business community of Troy decided that a &quot;short cut&quot; was needed for convenient access to the Erie Canal without having to go through the [[Port of Albany#History|Albany Basin]]. A side-cut to the Hudson was located at Watervliet's present-day 23rd Street (the Upper Side cut) finished in 1823,&lt;ref name=Bi/&gt; and another just south of the Arsenal (the Lower Side cut).&lt;ref name=Marker&gt;{{cite web | title = Erie Canal | publisher = The Historical Marker Database | url = http://www.hmdb.org/Marker.asp?Marker=12214 | accessdate = 2010-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; A weigh station and a center for paying canal boat operators was located here as well.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} As a result of canal boat crews being paid at the end of their trip, the areas around the side cut was once famous for gambling, saloons, and prostitution; there were more than 25 saloons within two blocks,&lt;ref name=Marker/&gt; with names like ''The Black Rag'' and ''Tub of Blood''.&lt;ref name=Canal/&gt; The neighborhood around the side cut had the nickname of &quot;Barbary Coast of the East&quot;, [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] being the &quot;Barbary Coast of the West&quot;.&lt;ref name=Marker/&gt;&lt;ref name=Canal/&gt; In the 1880s, Watervliet had a reputation for over 100 fights a day and a body once in the week in the Canal.&lt;ref name=Canal&gt;{{cite book | title = Low Bridge!: Folklore and the Erie Canal | author = Lionel D.

Also linking Watervliet to the transportation network of the region was the Watervliet Turnpike and the [[Albany and Northern Railway]]. The Watervliet Turnpike Company in 1828 built present-day [[New York State Route 32]] from the northern boundary of Albany north to the northern limit of Gibbonsville (now Broadway and 15th Street).&lt;ref name=History/&gt; The Albany and Northern Railway was built in 1852 connecting Watervliet to Albany, with a depot on Genesee Street; a few years later a new depot was built on Canal Street (Central Avenue) but was abandoned in favor of returning to the original location in 1864.&lt;ref name=Bi/&gt;

The current mayor of Watervliet is Michael Manning, elected to his first term in 2007. Mr. Manning, a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], defeated incumbent Mayor Robert Carlson in a rare Democratic primary election in September 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Primary Election Results |work=WRBG |publisher=[[Freedom Communications]]  |date=2007-09-18 |url=http://www.cbs6albany.com/onset?id=24171&amp;template=article.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. Carlson had served as mayor of Watervliet for ten years.

===St. Patrick's Church controversy===
In September 2011, the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Albany]] decided to close St. Patrick's Roman Catholic Church, which was claimed by the Albany Roman Catholic Diocese to be physically deteriorating; the church announced that it was unable to afford rehabilitation, which would have amounted to an estimated $4 million.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In March 2012, a developer filed a proposal to [[zoning|rezone]] the property from residential to business status so that it could raze the church (as well as an attached [[rectory]], former school building, and six private residences) in order to make way for a [[Price Chopper Supermarkets|Price Chopper]] grocery store.&lt;ref name=hearing&gt;{{cite news|last=Crowe|first=Kenneth|title=St. Patrick's public hearing in Watervliet Wednesday|url=http://www.timesunion.com/local/article/St-Patrick-s-public-hearing-in-Watervliet-3593203.php|accessdate=30 May 2012|newspaper=Times Union|date=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

St. Patrick's Church, which was the tallest point in the city, was closely modeled on the [[Notre-Dame de l’Immaculee-Conception, Lourdes|Upper Basilica]] in [[Lourdes]], and many{{who|date=September 2013}} considered it a defining piece of Watervliet's architecture.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}  Some members of the community responded to the proposal to raze the church with criticism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Churchill| first=Chris| title=A prayer of a chance for St. Patrick's? |url=http://www.timesunion.com/local/article/A-prayer-of-a-chance-for-St-Patrick-s-3518588.php#page-1| accessdate=30 May 2012| newspaper=Times Union| date=28 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Morrow| first=Ann| title=Is Nothing Sacred?| url=http://metroland.net/2012/04/26/is-nothing-sacred/| accessdate=30 May 2012| newspaper=Metroland| date=26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and legal challenges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.troyrecord.com/articles/2013/01/15/news/doc50f446b301835604608031.txt]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesunion.com/local/article/St-Patrick-s-demolition-fight-heats-up-4344807.php]&lt;/ref&gt;  On November 20, 2012, the Watervliet City Council voted unanimously to rezone the St. Patrick's Church property for business use, thus &quot;clearing the way&quot; for the redevelopment of the property and the deconstruction of the church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesunion.com/local/article/Vote-OKs-razing-of-St-Patrick-s-4055187.php#ixzz2CsW7rTi8]&lt;/ref&gt;  The deconstruction of the church was completed in May 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesunion.com/local/article/Last-chapter-shuts-on-St-Patrick-s-4531027.php]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rome''' is a city in [[New York|New York State]]. It is located in [[Oneida County, New York|Oneida County]], which is in north-central or &quot;Upstate&quot; New York. The population was 33,725 at the [[United States Census 2010|2010 census]]. Rome is one of two principal cities in the [[Utica-Rome Metropolitan Statistical Area]], which lies in the &quot;[[Leatherstocking Country]]&quot; made famous by [[James Fenimore Cooper]]'s [[Leatherstocking Tales]]. Rome is in [[New York's 24th congressional district]].

The city occupies a site that was important to the main 18th and 19th century waterway connecting the Atlantic seaboard of North America to the [[Great Lakes]]. The original settlements were associated with fortifications erected in the 1750s to defend the waterway, and in particular the British [[Fort Stanwix]] (1763). The development into a city began with the construction of the Rome Canal along the waterway in 1796, and in the same year the [[Administrative divisions of New York#Town|Town]] of Rome was formally created as a section of Oneida County. For a time, the small community immediately next to the canal was informally known as Lynchville, after the original owner of the property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Zackey |first=Christopher |title=The Naming of Rome, NY |url=http://www.jervislibrary.org/naming_of_rome.html |publisher=Jervis Public Library, Rome, NY |accessdate=2012-06-26}} This webpage cites several published sources.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Roman Grandeur in Central New York: The Classical Tradition in a Nineteenth-Century Pioneer Town |url=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/nyh/89.3/lemak.html |journal=New York History |volume=89 |last=Lemark |first=Joseph |year=2008}} This article mainly discusses [[Elmira, New York]], but does explain the tradition of naming Upstate New York towns and cities after classical sites.&lt;/ref&gt; The Town of Rome was converted formally into a [[Administrative divisions of New York#City|city]] by the New York State Legislature on February 23, 1870.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Things worth knowing about Oneida County |first1=William Walker |last1=Canfield |first2=J.

==History==

===Early History:  The Oneida Carrying Place===
For hundreds of years, the area occupied by the modern City of Rome, NY has enjoyed great strategic and commercial importance, sitting along an ancient east/west and northern trade route from the [[Great Lakes]] and [[Canada]] to the [[Hudson River]] and the sea.  The city is built astride the ''[[Oneida Carry|Oneida Carrying Place]]'', known to the [[Iroquois|Six Nations]] or [[Haudenosaunee]] people, as ''Deo-Wain-Sta'', or ''The Great Carrying Place''.  These names refer to a [[portage]] road or path between the [[Mohawk River]] to east and [[Wood Creek]] to the west, leading to [[Lake Ontario]].   Located within the modern city limits, this short portage path was the only overland section of a trade route stretching over a thousand miles between Lake Ontario and the lower Hudson.  Boats coming up the Mohawk River from the Hudson had to transfer their cargo and boats overland between 1.7  and six miles (depending on the season) to continue west to Lake Ontario.

The region was the scene of bloody fighting during the [[French and Indian War]].  The British had erected several small forts to guard the [[Oneida Carry|Oneida Carrying Place]] and the lucrative [[fur trade]] against French incursions from Canada.  However, a combined French, Canadian and Native American force overwhelmed and massacred a British force in the [[Battle of Fort Bull]].  Later in 1758, after several abortive attempts to fortify the area, the British sent a very large force to secure the Oneida Carry and build a stronger rampart complex named [[Fort Stanwix]].  The fort was abandoned at the conclusion of the war.

===Revolutionary War and Fort Stanwix===
[[File:Fort Stanwix, Rome NY - interior.jpg|thumb|right|View of the stockade around Fort Stanwix (1758 &amp; 1776. Reconstruction 1976). |alt=Photograph of a grassy field and a log stockade. The tops of log buildings are visible behind the stockade.]]
At the outbreak of the [[Revolutionary War]], [[Continental Army|American Continental]] forces reoccupied, rebuilt and improved [[Fort Stanwix]].  The installation played a pivotal role in the [[Saratoga Campaign]] of 1777, becoming renowned as &quot;the fort that never surrendered&quot;.  Patriot militia, regulars, and their [[Oneida Nation]] allies under the command of Col. [[Peter Gansevoort]], successfully repelled a prolonged siege in August 1777 by British, German, Loyalist, Canadian and Native American troops and warriors commanded by British Gen. [[Barry St. Leger]]. The failed siege combined with the battle at nearby [[Battle of Oriskany|Oriskany]] as well as the battles of [[Battle of Bennington|Bennington]], and [[Battle of Saratoga|Saratoga]] thwarted a coordinated British effort to take the northern colonies, and led to American alliances with France and the Netherlands.

After the British repulse at Fort Stanwix, bloody fighting erupted along the American northern frontier, resulting in terrible losses to American settlers but especially the people of the [[Iroquois|Six Nations]].  Fort Stanwix became the primary staging point for American attacks against British loyalist units and their [[Haudenosaunee]] allies, including the [[Sullivan Expedition]] of 1779, a ruthless scorched earth campaign against [[Iroqouis]] villages allied with the British.  This campaign was ordered by [[George Washington]] in response to fierce frontier attacks and atrocities such as the [[Cherry Valley Massacre]] by loyalist irregulars led by [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]] Chief [[Joseph Brant]] and [[John Butler (pioneer)|John Butler]].  The fort continued to shield America's northwest frontier from British campaigns until it was finally abandoned in 1781.

===Commercial Growth:  The Erie Canal===
The [[Oneida Carry]] and the critical east/west American trade route through the frontier was formalized by construction of the [[Erie Canal]]. On July 4, 1817 construction on the [[Erie Canal]] began in Rome;

===Manufacturing Legacy:  The Copper City===
''[[Revere Copper Company|Revere Copper Products, Inc.]]'' is one of the oldest [[manufacturing]] companies in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.reverecopper.com/&lt;/ref&gt; Revere Copper Products Incorporated was formed in Rome, NY between 1928 and 1929 as a series of mergers between several companies of which one of them being [[Revere Copper Company]] located in [[Canton, Massachusetts]].  The first president of [[Revere Copper Products, Inc]] George H. Allen was formerly the president of Michigan Copper and Brass Company&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,732056,00.html | work=Time | title=Business &amp; Finance: Mergers: Oct. 22, 1928 | date=1928-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; also included in the merger.   The early history of Revere Copper Products, Inc is detailed in the book ''Copper Heritage: The Story of Revere Copper and Brass, Inc.'' by Isaac F. Marcosson.   At one time, 10 percent of all copper products used in the United States were manufactured in Rome.

[[Jesse Williams]] founded America's first [[cheese]] factory at Rome in 1851.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Is One Museum Honoring Cheese Really Enough? |first=Danny |last=Hakim |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/10/nyregion/10cheese.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=April 10, 2006 |accessdate=June 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The City of Rome was incorporated in 1870.

===Cold War and Technology Role===
Between 1951 and 1991, the [[Rome Air Development Center]] (RADC) was located at [[Griffiss Air Force Base|Griffiss AFB]]. In 1991, the RADC was redesignated [[Rome Laboratory]].  It remained active as the Griffiss AFB was closed as part of the [[Base Realignment and Closure]] process in 1993.  In 1997, Rome Laboratory was made part of the [[Air Force Research Laboratory]] and renamed the Rome Research Site. The RADC has been responsible for some of the [[United States Air Force]]'s major technological accomplishments, especially in the area of [[radio communications]].

The [[Eastern Air Defense Sector]] (EADS) is also located in Rome, on the site of the former Griffiss Air Force Base.

The nationally recognized rock festival, [[Woodstock 1999]] was held in Rome, with the city once again making use of the former Griffiss Air Force Base site. The 3-day festival was held the weekend of July 23–25, and drew a crowd of about 200,000 people. Cable network MTV covered the concert extensively, and live coverage of the entire weekend was available on pay-per-view. The festival featured a diverse assortment of acts including Metallica, Kid Rock, DMX, Red Hot Chili Peppers, and Wyclef Jean; early reviews for many of the acts were positive; critics particularly praised performances by George Clinton, Jamiroquai, James Brown, Sheryl Crow, and Rage Against the Machine. A full list of appearances can be found at [[Woodstock 1999]].

In July 2005, New York City developers, Park Drive Estates, purchased the former Woodhaven Housing- formerly the base housing for Griffiss Air Force officers and enlisted military members, and are in the process of re-developing that land into a resort-style active adult community.

==Geography==
Rome is the second largest city by area in [[New York State]], and the 140th [[List of United States cities by area|largest city in the United States]]. According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|75.7|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|74.9|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|0.8|sqmi|km2}} (0.99%) is water.{{GR|1}}

Rome averages over {{convert|120|in|mm}} of snowfall each winter, mostly due to its proximity to [[Lake Ontario]] and the [[lake-effect snow]] that it produces. Rome is the home base for the West Rome Riders, Inc. snowmobile club,&lt;ref&gt;www.westromeriders.com&lt;/ref&gt; who maintain {{convert|41|mi|km}} of trails in and around Rome to Taberg, North Rome, Verona Beach State Park, and to Kanon Valley Country Club.

===The Rome Sand Plains===
{{main|Rome Sand Plains}}
Located within the city is a rare environmental area:  the [[Rome Sand Plains]]. The Rome Sand Plains is a {{convert|15000|acre|km2|adj=on}} inland pine barrens that consists of a diverse mosaic of high sand dunes and low peat bogs, mixed northern hardwood forests, meadows and wetlands. The Rome Sand Plains harbor rare and unusual species, including carnivorous plants like the pitcher plant and sundew, and animals like the red-shouldered hawk and fisher. It is one of only a handful of inland [[pine barrens]] remaining in the United States.  Several civic groups including the [[Nature Conservancy]] in conjunction with [[New York State Department of Environmental Conservation]] have successfully preserved portions of the Sand Plains and visitors are able to walk and bike this unique environment. Poor farming and overgrazing had reduced much of the area to desert patches by the 1930s when it first began to revert to forest cover, grazing cattle had eaten the hardwood saplings allowing pines to temporarily overtake them but as the forest stand ages it will return to hardwoods such as oak, cherry and maple.

==Demographics==

==Sports==
The city of Rome became home to a professional sports franchise, when the [[Rome Frenzy]] of the Federal Hockey League began play in November 2010. The team played its home games in the renovated [[John F. Kennedy Civic Arena]]. On 23 June 2011, citing poor attendance, the Frenzy suspended operations and cancelled the 2011-12 season in Rome, vowing to relocate the team to a more sustainable location.&lt;ref&gt;http://theromefrenzy.pointstreaksites.com/view/theromefrenzy/news-235/news_28052&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1964 and 1988 the Rome Knights and later the Copper City Chiefs played their home games on Saturday evenings at the &quot;Kennedy Arena&quot;. The Chiefs were a semi-professional ice hockey club which competed against senior and Iitermediate level teams from Province of Ontario, Canada, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Newark, New Jersey, New England, and other cities from the State of New York. The Chiefs were known for a physical and aggressive style of ice hockey, the team roster being built around team toughness. In the 25 years of existence, the Chiefs never had a losing season.&lt;ref&gt;''The History of the Copper City Chiefs''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government==
The city government consists of a mayor and a common council. The mayor is elected at large. The common council consists of 7 members who are elected from one of 7 wards. Each ward elects one member.

==Transportation==
[[File:Amtrak Station Rome NY.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Rome Railroad Station]]
Rome's primary road connection is the Utica-Rome Expressway, a freeway section of [[New York State Route 49]]. The expressway runs 14 miles from Rome to Utica, where it meets [[I-90]], [[I-790]], [[NY 5]], [[NY 12]], and [[NY 8]] in a massive cloverleaf interchange.

[[Rome (Amtrak station)|Rome's Amtrak station]] is served by [[Amtrak]]'s ''[[Empire Service (Amtrak)|Empire Service]]'', with two daily trains in each direction between Niagara Falls and New York City as well as the daily ''[[Maple Leaf (train)|Maple Leaf]]'' between Toronto and New York.

[[Griffiss Air Force Base]] closed in 1995 and was converted into [[Griffiss International Airport]], which sees general aviation as well as military use. However, no scheduled commercial service uses the airport.

[[Central New York Regional Transportation Authority|CENTRO]] buses run six routes in Rome, two of which serve the Amtrak station.

== History ==

The first European settlers on the Tenendeho Creek in the area of today's Mechanicville arrived in 1764.  Actually, the first listing for a settlement on Thenendehowa Creek is in 1721.  At that time, Cornelius Van Buren had a sawmill at the mouth of the creek where it emptied into the Hudson.  The first documented occurrence of the name &quot;Mechanicville&quot; dates back to 1829.  The name comes from the early settlers, who were independent mastercraftsmen such as millers, carpenters, or butchers, whose professions were commonly known as the &quot;mechanical arts&quot; at the time.

About 35 years later, small flour mills were already established. When the [[Champlain Canal]] reached the settlement in 1823, and especially when the [[Rensselaer and Saratoga Railroad]] laid a track through the area in 1835, Mechanicville became an important commerce interchange.

The community became an [[Municipal incorporation|incorporated]] [[Administrative divisions of New York#Village|village]] in 1859, when it had about 1000 inhabitants. It grew rapidly as textile mills, factories and a linen thread company came to Mechanicville. The first conspicuous casualty of the [[American Civil War]], [[Elmer E. Ellsworth]], was buried in Mechanicville in 1861. In 1878, additional railways came to the village, and it became an important center of papermaking. In 1898, a [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] power plant was built on the Hudson River by Robert Newton King, and is now the oldest continuously-operating hydroelectric plant in the United States.   The [[Mechanicville Hydroelectric Plant]] was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1989.&lt;ref name=&quot;nris&quot;&gt;{{NRISref|2009a}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1900, it was a major transfer yard and car repair center for the railways. In the 1920s, Mechanicville had a population of nearly 10000.

Mechanicville became a city in 1915. By 1932, it became the terminal of the first experimental [[High-voltage direct current|high-voltage direct-current]] (HVDC) scheme in the U.S.: the [[HVDC Mechanicville–Schenectady]] line.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.ieee.org/organizations/pes/public/2005/may/peshistory.html] IEEE History retrieved 2011 May 10. &lt;/ref&gt;

With the decline of the railroads, Mechanicville suffered. The largest paper mill in the world which Mechanicville had once hosted (in 1904), ceased operations in 1971.  The once thriving industry city is today a quiet residential city, with most inhabitants working in [[Albany, New York|Albany]], [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]], and other nearby communities.

===Mechanicville-Stillwater tornado outbreak===
{{Main|Late-May 1998 Tornado Outbreak and Derecho}}
On May 31, 1998, a large [[tornado]] tore through Mechanicville and the adjacent town of Stillwater.  It was spawned by a series of severe storms in the late afternoon, causing major damage to the town's old industrial section located on US Route 4 and NY-32 along the Hudson River.  One of the two historic smokestacks (visible from 2 miles away) was knocked down by the tornado. In 2005, the other smokestack and the conjoined building were bulldozed. Houses on the Viall Avenue hill sections of Mechanicville and Stillwater were completely destroyed. The tornado was rated F3 on the [[Fujita scale]] (winds estimated at 200 MPH).

===Rail yard===
In January 2012, a new [[Intermodal freight transport|intermodal]] and automotive terminal opened on the site of a former [[Boston and Maine]] rail yard. The new rail yard was built by [[Pan Am Southern]], a joint venture between [[Pan Am Railways]] and [[Norfolk Southern]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesunion.com/local/article/Rail-yard-too-noisy-for-neighbors-3372116.php Rail yard too noisy for neighbors[, Times Union, February 29, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The $40 million facility will also be used for ''filet-toupee'' operations, converting [[Double-stack rail transport|double stack]] container trains from the west to single stack by removing the top layer of containers. This allows the rest of the train to proceed east along track that lacks double stack clearance, particularly the 4-3/4 mile [[Hoosac Tunnel]]. The removed containers are trucked to local destinations. ''Toupee'' refers to the reverse process, where a single stack train coming from the east has additional containers placed on top for the rest of its trip.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timesunion.com/default/article/Railyard-project-back-on-track-1346087.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://samayotte.com/PAR_Mechanicville_3.html Photos of the new rail yard under construction&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://samayotte.com/PAR_Mechanicville_4.html Photos of the new rail yard open for business&lt;/ref&gt;
Some 300 trucks a day visit the site. The automotive terminal is expected to open in the summer of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.saratogian.com/general-news/20120324/boom-ii-overshadowed-by-globalfoundries-new-rail-hub-could-spur-unprecedented-growth-along-route-67-corridor-in-stillwater-with-video&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hornell''' is a [[Administrative divisions of New York#City|city]] in [[Steuben County, New York|Steuben County]], [[New York]], [[United States]]. The population was 8,563 at the 2000 census. The city is named after the Hornell family, early settlers. Its current population has not yet been released by the new census.

The City of Hornell is surrounded by [[Hornellsville, New York|Town of Hornellsville]]. Hornell is about 55 miles south of [[Rochester, Monroe County, New York|Rochester]] and is near the western edge of Steuben County.

Hornell is nicknamed the &quot;Maple City&quot; after the large [[maple]] trees that once grew throughout the town and covered the surrounding hills of the Canisteo Valley. Hornell has the largest [[Saint Patrick's Day]] parade and celebration in the area, bringing many out to welcome spring and show their green. It has also become a tradition that Mayor Shawn Hogan finds an innovative way of making his way down main street on this particular day.

Hornell Municipal Airport (4G6) is located a few miles north of the city on [[New York State Route 36|Route 36]].  The airport has a hard surface runway capable of landing small jets, a rotating beacon and fuel.

== History ==
[[Image:HornellNY1920s.jpg|thumb|left|Main Street, Hornell in the 1920s]]
What is now Hornell was first settled in 1790 under the name &quot;Upper Canisteo&quot; to distinguish it from the community of [[Canisteo (village), New York|Canisteo]], then known as &quot;Lower Canisteo&quot;.  The family of Benjamin Crosby were the first settlers in what is now Hornell.  The area was incorporated as a [[town]] in 1820, as &quot;Hornellsville.&quot;  The name comes from early settler George Hornell Jr, who built the first [[gristmill]] here. 
[[File:Hornell NY St Patricks Day.jpg|thumb|left|The 2011 [[Saint Patrick's Day]] parade in Hornell.]]
The City of Hornell was chartered in 1888 as the &quot;City of Hornellsville,&quot; (having been first organized as the &quot;Village of Hornellsville&quot; in 1852).  The name was changed to Hornell in 1906.

Major flooding in 1935 put parts of the city under water, prompting the creation of a system of levees to prevent futre serious flooding issues.

The former city park, Union park, was destroyed by the urban renewal of the 1970s.

In 1950, Hornell had a population near 16,000 people.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

The current mayor of Hornell is Democrat Shawn Hogan, who has held the position since January 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.cityofhornell.com/departments/mayor_hogan.html |title=City of Hornell Mayor's Office |accessdate=2008-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hogan is the longest-serving current mayor in New York State.

In 2009 Kirk W. House produced ''Around Hornell'', a historic photo book in Arcadia Publishing's &quot;Images of America&quot; series.  ''Around Hornell'' also includes the surrounding rural communities of Canisteo, Dansville, Fremont, Hartsville, Hornellsville, and Howard.

The [[Hornell Armory]], [[Hornell Public Library]], [[Adsit House]], [[St. Ann's Federation Building]], and [[United States Post Office (Hornell, New York)|United States Post Office]] are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nris&quot;&gt;{{NRISref|2009a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Railroads and Hornell ===
The [[New York and Erie Railroad]] arrived in Hornell in 1850, which connected [[New York City]] and [[Dunkirk (city), New York|Dunkirk]] on [[Lake Erie]] via a southern tier route. Another route, the ([[Buffalo and New York City Railroad]]) was added in 1852, branching from Hornell northwestward to [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]. For the next hundred years Hornell enjoyed prosperity with its steam engine shop doing the repairs for the entire railroad line. The railroad then came upon hard times as trucking picked up more and more of the freight business.  In 1972, the line filed for bankruptcy. Just a few days later floods from [[Hurricane Agnes]] destroyed about {{convert|200|mi|km}} of roadbed along the [[Canisteo River]], removing all hope of reorganizing the railroad.
[[Image:Hornell NY LOC 123223pu.jpg|thumb|left|[[Erie Railway]] shop in Hornell - aerial photo from 1971]]

Hornell has struggled since to regain its former prosperity.  The Erie shops are now [[Alstom]]'s main North American assembly and manufacturing site for the production of AC traction motors, railway cars, and passenger locomotives. Car bodies are [[Complete knock down|shipped]] from [[Sao Paulo]], [[Brazil]] and completed as final cars in Hornell.  Prior to [[Alstom]], the shops were operated by [[Morrison Knudsen]]. After a difficult period Alstom Transport has won a contract worth $194 million USD to execute the complete overhaul of the Port Authority Transit Corporation (PATCO) metro fleet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |last= |first= |title=PATCO’s entire metro fleet to be modernised between Philadelphia and Southern New Jersey |date=07/02/2011 |publisher=Alstom |url=http://www.alstom.com/press-centre/2011/2/A-contract-valued-at-around-140-million-euros-in-the-US/ |format= |accessdate=2013-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The entire refurbishment and testing process will be managed by Alstom’s Transport Life Services (TLS) unit and take place in the facility in Hornell, NY (which is the largest of its kind in the United States).

== History ==

=== Early colonial history ===
Johnstown, originally John's Town, was founded in 1762 by [[Sir William Johnson]], a Baronet who named it after his son John Johnson.&lt;ref&gt;Decker, back cover&lt;/ref&gt;  William Johnson came to the British colony of New York from [[Ireland]] in 1732.&lt;ref name=&quot;Decker, p.7&quot;&gt;Decker, p.7&lt;/ref&gt;  He was a trader who learned [[Indigenous people of the Americas|American Indian]] languages and culture, forming close relationships with many Native American leaders.  He was appointed as the Superintendent of Indian Affairs, as well as a [[Major General]] in the [[Great Britain|British]] forces during the [[French and Indian War]] ([[Seven Years War]]). His alliances with the Iroquois were significant to the war.

As a reward for his services, Johnson received large tracts of land in what are now [[Hamilton County, New York|Hamilton]] and [[Fulton County, New York|Fulton]] counties. He established Johnstown and became one of New York's most prosperous and influential citizens. He was the largest landowner in the Mohawk Valley, with an estate of more than {{convert|400000|acre|km2}} before his death. Having begun as an Indian trader, he expanded his business interests to include a sawmill and lumber business, and a flour mill that served the area. Johnson, the largest slaveholder in the county and perhaps in the state of New York, had some 60 enslaved Africans working these businesses. He also recruited many [[Ulster Scots people|Scots-Irish]] tenant farmers to work his lands.&lt;ref&gt;Williams-Myers, p. 24; 29-30&lt;/ref&gt;  Observing Johnson's successful business endeavors, the local Native American inhabitants dubbed him ''Warragghivagey'', or &quot;he who does much business.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Decker, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; [[Image:Ft.johnstown (Small).jpg|thumb|left|Fort Johnstown, New York State Historic Site]]

As the area initially owned and settled by Johnson grew, he convinced the Governor, [[William Tryon|Lord William Tryon]], to establish a new county in upstate New York west of [[Albany County, New York|Albany County]]. This new county was named [[Tryon County, New York|Tryon]], after the governor, and Johnstown was made the county seat.&lt;ref name=&quot;Decker, p.7&quot;/&gt;  The [[Fulton County Courthouse (New York)|county courthouse]], built by William Johnson in Johnstown in 1772, partly at his own expense, still stands today, as the oldest operating courthouse in New York.&lt;ref&gt;Decker, p.8&lt;/ref&gt;  Sir William Johnson died in 1774 before the American colonies declared their [[United States Declaration of Independence|independence]] from [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]].

=== Revolutionary War and aftermath ===
Although the majority of the fighting during the [[American Revolution]] raged elsewhere, Johnstown did see its share of fighting late in the war.  With area residents not knowing of [[Cornwallis]]' defeat and surrender at the [[Siege of Yorktown|Battle of Yorktown]] in [[Virginia]], about 1400 soldiers fought at the [[Battle of Johnstown]], one of the last battles of the American Revolution, on October 25, 1781. The Continental forces, led by Col. [[Marinus Willett]] of Johnstown, ultimately put the British to flight.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.johnstown.com/batljohn.html  Historic Johnstown, New York (Battle of Johnstown)]&lt;/ref&gt;  During that time, many British [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|loyalists]] fled both Johnstown and the surrounding area for [[Canada]]. including Johnson's surviving family.  Sir William Johnson's home suffered vandalism at the hands of Continental soldiers quartered there.&lt;ref&gt;Decker pp 32-33; 116&lt;/ref&gt;

After the American Revolution, Johnstown became part of [[Montgomery County, New York|Montgomery County]] when the name of Tryon County was changed to honor the Continental General [[Richard Montgomery]], who died at the [[Battle of Quebec (1775)|Battle of Quebec]]. All of the Johnson property was forfeited to the state because of the family's [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] sentiments and support for the British cause. Sir William Johnson's manor house and estate were subsequently purchased by [[Silas Talbot]], a naval officer and hero of the American Revolution.

In 1803 the community of Johnstown was incorporated as a [[Administrative divisions of New York#Village|village]].

The village of Johnstown became a city in 1895 becoming separate from the town.

In 1889, shortly after the [[Johnstown Flood]] in Pennsylvania, Johnstown New York suffered a similarly devastating flood. Cayadutta Creek rampaged, Schreiber's Skin Mill was swept away, as was the State Street bridge, and over twenty people were drowned or missing when the flood carried away the Perry Street bridge.

[[Johnson Hall]] was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1960.  It is operated by New York State as an historic site, with regularly scheduled special events.

=== Formation of Fulton County ===
Some forty years later, in 1838, Johnstown's county affiliation changed yet again when what by then remained of Mongomery County was divided into two separate counties: Montgomery and [[Fulton County, New York|Fulton]]. While the village of [[Fonda, New York|Fonda]] became the new county seat of Montgomery County, Johnstown became the county seat of Fulton County.

==Historically important residents of Johnstown==

===Silas Talbot===
Silas Talbot moved with his family to Johnstown, where he purchased Sir William Johnson's estate and manor house. A hero of the American Revolution, he later served as a member of the [[New York Assembly]] (1792–1793) and as a congressman in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] (1793–1794) from that district.

In 1797 he supervised the building of the ''[[USS Constitution]]'' (''Old Iron Sides'') at the [[Charlestown Navy Yard]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], [[Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mysticseaport.org/library/manuscripts/coll/coll018/coll018.cfm#head63744416 Mystic Seaport Library (Silas Talbot)]; Decker p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; Talbot commanded the ''USS Constitution'', largely in the West Indies, from 1799 to 1801, when he retired from the U.S. Navy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mysticseaport.org/library/manuscripts/coll/coll018/coll018.cfm#head63744416 Mystic Seaport Library (Silas Talbot)]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Daniel Cady ===
One of the men instrumental in shaping Fulton County was Judge [[Daniel Cady]], a prominent Johnstown resident. Sometimes called &quot;the father of Fulton County&quot;, Cady named the new county after [[Robert Fulton]], who was related by marriage to Cady's wife, Margaret Livingston. Robert Fulton, an inventor, is perhaps best known for devising the improvements that made steamboats commercially viable.&lt;ref&gt;Decker, p 33&lt;/ref&gt;

Judge Daniel Cady was one of Johnstown's most important citizens. With indirect connections by marriage to [[John Jacob Astor]] and that family's lucrative fur business interests, Daniel Cady, adept at managing these connections and his own business interests, joined the ranks of the wealthiest landowners in New York. After moving to Johnstown in 1799, he married Margaret Livingston, whose father, Col. [[James Livingston (American Revolution)|James Livingston]], fought in the Continental Army at the battles of Quebec and [[Battle of Saratoga|Saratoga]] during the American Revolution. Col. Livingston is credited with frustrating [[Benedict Arnold]]'s attempted treason by firing on ''The Vulture'', the boat intended to carry Arnold to safety.&lt;ref&gt;Griffith, p 4&lt;/ref&gt; A public servant as well as astute lawyer and businessman, Judge Cady served in the New York state legislature from 1808 until 1814. In 1814 he was elected as a [[Federalist Party|Federalist]] to one term in the [[United States House of Representatives]]. In 1816, he returned to Johnstown from Washington and resumed his legal practice. He later served as a judge on the [[New York Supreme Court]], Fourth District, from 1847 until 1855. Cady died in Johnstown in 1859 and is buried in the cemetery there.&lt;ref&gt;Griffith, p 5&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Israel T. Hatch ===
Harch was born in Johnstown. He went on to become mayor of [[Buffalo, New York]] and was also elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. He was law partners with [[Henry K. Smith]], who also became a mayor of Buffalo.

=== Elizabeth Cady Stanton ===
Daniel Cady is today perhaps best known as the father of the prominent [[women's rights]] activist [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], who was born in Johnstown in 1815. Stanton, who later worked in partnership with [[Susan B. Anthony]] and served for many years as president of the [[National Woman Suffrage Association]] (NWSA), spent her childhood in Johnstown, where she studied at the Johnstown Academy. It was one of the first schools in New York to receive a teaching certificate issued by the newly formed state education system in the later 19th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Decker&quot;&gt;Decker&lt;/ref&gt;  After leaving to continue her education in [[Troy, New York]], Stanton returned to Johnstown with her husband [[Henry Stanton|Henry Brewster Stanton]], a lawyer and abolitionist who studied law under her father, Daniel Cady.&lt;ref&gt;Griffith&lt;/ref&gt; Because of her role, Johnstown, together with [[Seneca Falls (village), New York|Seneca Falls]], NY, where Elizabth Cady Stanton helped organize the first [[Women's Rights Convention]] held in 1848, lays claim to being the birthplace of the [[Women's rights|Women's Rights Movement]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Decker, pp 16 &amp; 33&lt;/ref&gt; Stanton's speech, ''[[List of signatories of the Declaration of Sentiments|The Declaration of Sentiments]]'', given at the Seneca Falls convention and modeled on the &quot;[[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]&quot;, is generally credited with instigating the women's suffrage movement in the [[United States]].

==Industry in Johnstown==

=== Glove industry and related enterprise===
With plentiful forests and the wood bark they produced, Johnstown became a center for [[tanning]] of [[leather]] during the late 19th century.  By the early 20th century Johnstown, along with neighboring Gloversville, became known as the glove-making capital of the world.  Nicknamed the &quot;Glove Cities&quot;, the two cities are still called that today.&lt;ref name=&quot;Decker&quot;/&gt; Many fringe business once existed to support the glove and leather industries around Johnstown.  Box manufacturers, thread dealers, sewing machine repairmen, chemical companies and many others made a living helping to supply and service the industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Decker&quot;/&gt;

Johnstown and Gloversville were home to numerous glove manufacturing companies and dozens of leather tanners and finishers.  Thousands of people were employed by or affiliated with the glove and leather industries, making them a major part of the economic history of the two cities. {{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

Throughout most of the history of the glove industry in Johnstown, most companies used home workers to sew the gloves. Men cut the gloves from leather in factories and women hand sewed the gloves at home.  Later when the sewing machine was developed, many women moved to the factories to work.  Until the last years of the 20th century, home glove workers were still working in the area.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

The glove-making industry, together with its related businesses, had its ups and downs. It was directly affected by tax and tariff laws.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} The tanneries and glove shops flourished during [[World War II]] when most of the “Military Black” leather gloves worn by American servicemen were produced in Fulton County, New York.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} During the last half of the 20th century, however, the cities' economies steadily declined as business was lost to low-wage manufacturing operations overseas. Today countries such as China and the Philippines produce most of the world’s gloves.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} While some companies still remain in the Glove Cities, just a few manufacture their product in the United States.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}  The others use overseas labor to sew gloves.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} Today only one glove manufacturer is located in Johnstown, while a few operate in Gloversville. {{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

Although the leather industry has declined, some local companies have survived by developing leather products suited to niche markets.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}  The remaining businesses concentrate on one or two types of leather.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} They remain ready to adapt to changes in trends. There are still two tanneries operating in Johnstown and a few more in Gloversville.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} Another handful of state-of-the-art leather finishing facilities can be found there, as well as a dozen or so leather dealers.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

=== Knox Gelatine ===
One of the early industries to establish itself in Johnstown was the Knox [[gelatine]] plant, built in 1890 by [[Charles Knox]], a prominent Johnstown resident. Charles Knox developed the granulated, unflavored gelatin still used in food preparation today. When Knox died in 1908, his wife [[Rose Knox]] assumed management of the business.  She became one of the earliest successful American businesswomen.  The Knox family and its philanthropic foundation were generous to the city. Results of their philanthropy can still be found there today. They gave the city the block of land known as Knox Field, where the playgrounds, athletic fields, and bridle path are located. Knox Junior High School was named in honor of the family. The Knox Gelatin plant, once a major employer in Johnstown, closed in 1975 following the sale of the company to the [[Lipton]] Tea Company.&lt;ref&gt;Decker, pp 53-66&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 4.9&amp;nbsp;square miles (12.6&amp;nbsp;km²), of which, 4.9&amp;nbsp;square&amp;nbsp;miles (12.6&amp;nbsp;km²) of it is land and 0.21% is water.

Johnstown lies in the picturesque [[Mohawk Valley]] of upstate New York. Located in what is now Fulton County, it is slightly north of the route developed for the [[Erie Canal]] through what is now Montgomery County.

Although not a hilltown, Johnstown is close to the [[Adirondack Mountains]] that stretch across the northern portion of Fulton County. It is situated near the southern border of the [[Adirondack Park]].

The Cayadutta Creek just south of the city provided water power needed to generate the electricity required by the various industries that grew up in Johnstown.&lt;ref&gt;Decker, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

East-west highways, [[New York State Route 29]] and [[New York State Route 67]], intersect in the city and also cross the north-south highway [[New York State Route 30A]]. Johnstown is located close to the [[New York Thruway]].

[[File:Sunday at Rye Beach by Genthe.jpg|thumb|left|Rye Beach, early 20th century]]
[[File:Dragoncoastertunnel.JPG|thumb|left|The Dragon Coaster, Playland's signature wooden roller coaster.]]
Rye was at one time a part of Fairfield County, Conn., which was a belonging of the Sachem Ponus, of the Ponus Wekuwuhm, Canaan Parish, and which was probably named for that chieftan, &quot;Peningoe Neck&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Selleck|first=Rev. Charles M.|title=Norwalk|year=1896|url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nnc1.cu01644378;seq=47;view=1up;num=37|page=371}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest house in the city, the [[Timothy Knapp House]], is owned by the Rye Historical Society and dates in its original version to around 1667. It was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1982.  Also listed on the National Register of Historic Places are the [[African Cemetery]], [[Bird Homestead]], [[Widow Haviland's Tavern]], [[Rye Town Park-Bathing Complex and Oakland Beach]] and [[United States Post Office (Rye, New York)|United States Post Office]].  The [[Boston Post Road Historic District (Rye, New York)|Boston Post Road Historic District]] was listed in 1982 as a National Historic Landmark.&lt;ref name=&quot;nris&quot;&gt;{{NRISref|version=2010a}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Rye Meeting House]] was added in 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;nps&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cr.nps.gov/nr/listings/20110211.htm|title=National Register of Historic Places Listings|date=2011-02-11|work=Weekly List of Actions Taken on Properties: 1/31/11 through  2/04/11|publisher=National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Historical Society also owns a former inn/tavern built in 1730, the Square House, which it operates as a museum. [[George Washington]] stayed at the Square House on two separate occasions, remarking favorably on his stay in his diaries.

The Jay Property at 210 Boston Post Road, where New York State's only native-born founding father [[John Jay]] grew up and where he is buried, is now the home of the not-for-profit organization the [http://jaycenter.org Jay Heritage Center]. The Center's mission is to restore and preserve the [[1838 Peter Augustus Jay House]], which occupies the original site of the Jay family farm, &quot;The Locusts&quot;. Restoration of the Jay mansion overlooking [[Long Island Sound]] is an official project of the [[Save America's Treasures]] Program. With its soaring [[Corinthian column]]s, and [[pediment]]ed facade, the house is a textbook example of American [[Greek Revival architecture]] popularized before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and is noted for its many design elements influenced by [[Minard Lafever]]. The Jay Mansion is the oldest [[National Historic Landmark]] (NHL) structure in New York State with a [[geothermal heating]] and cooling system and the first in Westchester County to have such an energy efficient system. The Jay Heritage Center was recently designated a member site of the [http://hudsonrivervalley.com Hudson River Valley National Heritage Area]. It is also listed on Westchester County's [http://tourism.westchestergov.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=37&amp;Itemid= African American Heritage Trail]. John Jay was well known for advocating [[emancipation]], serving as President of the [[New York Manumission Society]] and establishing the first [[African Free School]].

Rye is known for its theme park, [[Playland (New York)|Rye Playland]], a popular destination in the early 20th century, where people were able to take their boats right up to the park. Its famous roller coaster, the [[Dragon Coaster (Playland)|Dragon Coaster]], was at one time a Top-10 [[wooden roller coaster]] in the world.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} [[Glenn Close]] and Ellen Latzen ride the roller coaster in the 1980s thriller, ''[[Fatal Attraction]]''. Playland is also the setting for several key scenes in the comedy film, ''[[Big (film)|Big]]'', starring [[Tom Hanks]].

Rye is served by three public elementary schools: Osborn, Milton and Midland. Rye Middle School and [[Rye High School (Rye, New York)|Rye High School]] follow; they are part of the same campus, and the two buildings connect.

The annual Rye-[[Harrison High School (New York)|Harrison]] football game has been played for almost 80 years and is a top high school football rivalry in Westchester County. The Rye team has won three recent New York State championships, two consecutively, and has defeated Harrison in nine consecutive meetings. Harrison leads the all-time series with a record of 41-37-3.

'''Plattsburgh''' is a city in and [[county seat]] of [[Clinton County, New York]], [[United States]]. The population was 19,989 at the [[United States Census, 2010|2010 census]].{{GR|2}} The population of the unincorporated areas within the [[Plattsburgh (town), New York|Town of Plattsburgh]] was 11,870 as of the [[United States Census, 2010|2010 census]]; making the population for the immediate [[Plattsburgh, New York (disambiguation)|Plattsburgh, New York Region]] 31,859.

The city of Plattsburgh is located entirely within the original boundaries of the [[Town (New York)|town]] of [[Plattsburgh (town), New York|Plattsburgh]] and is in the [[North Country, New York|North Country]] region of the northeastern part of the state.

== Micropolitan Statistical Area ==
The City of Plattsburgh is the population center and county seat at the heart of the Plattsburgh Micropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) - population 82,128 as of the 2010 Census.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;2010 Census Redistricting Data for Clinton County, NY&quot;, Retrieved 3/28/11 from http://www.factfinder.census.gov/&lt;/ref&gt;  A statistical area representing the greater Plattsburgh region (as defined by the U.S. government), the Plattsburgh MSA includes all communities in the immediate [[Clinton County, New York]] area.

== History ==

=== Under French rule ===
As early as [[Samuel de Champlain]]'s 1609 expedition into the [[Lake Champlain]] valley,&lt;ref name=&quot;Perkins, G.H. 1879&quot;&gt;Perkins, G.H. (1879). Archaeology of the Champlain Valley. ''American Naturalist'', V.13, No. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; this region began to fall under the influence of the French - and later under American and English colonial power. Early French contact and the proximity of Plattsburgh to [[Quebec]], make this a historically French region.  Situated within and intimately intertwined with the extended fur trade network positioned in the [[Montreal]] hinterland (and beyond), this area fell within the lands of the [[coureur des bois]] affiliated with the larger trading hub in Montreal. While Plattsburgh is cited by American historians as being a relatively new city, the area became occupied somewhere after the arrival of [[Samuel de Champlain]] in 1609 and the beginning of the [[Fur Trade]] in Montreal in the mid-to-late 17th century. While permanent French settlement was hampered by the looming threat of armed conflict with [[Iroquois]] natives of the region, French missionaries did begin to settle alongside local indigenous populations where Native villages were found, as early as 1609.&lt;ref&gt;Lake Champlain Maritime Museum, Available &quot;http://www.lcmm.org/shipwrecks_history/history/history_contact.htm&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the area near Plattsburgh is notable for being the site of an indigenous village.&lt;ref name=&quot;Perkins, G.H. 1879&quot;/&gt;

=== Transition to British and then American rule ===
Plattsburgh and much of the lands comprising present day [[Clinton County, New York|Clinton County]] were originally part of the French settlement of [[New France]]. They stayed a part of New France until the outcome of the [[French and Indian War]], where the [[France|French]] lost their hold on this region to the [[United Kingdom|British]]. This conflict (1754–1763) predated the [[American Revolutionary War|American Revolution]] (1775–1783). As a condition of the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|1763 Treaty of Paris]], a vast region including present-day Plattsburgh was ceded from France to Britain. It was incorporated into British rule as part of the [[Indian Reserve (1763)|Indian Reserve]]. The Reserve was established by Britain as an attempt to protect British colonial positions in [[New England]] and the [[Middle Colonies]] using the newly acquired lands to buffer against armed conflict with either France or [[Spain]]. The founding of present day Plattsburgh, however, was not an act of the British, rather it coincided with the American territorial acquisition after the [[American Revolutionary War]]; ended as per the agreement between the newly established [[United States|United States of America]] and Great Britain via the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|1783 Treaty of Paris]].

=== Plattsburgh's founding under American rule ===
Plattsburgh was founded by [[Zephaniah Platt]] in 1785 after he was granted the land by [[George Clinton (British politician)|George Clinton]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Zephaniah Platt&quot;. Zephaniah Platt. Retrieved on March 2, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In granting land to Zephaniah Platt of [[Poughkeepsie, New York]] - who went on to establish the new city of Plattsburgh to buffer emerging American interests in the [[Saint Lawrence River]] valley and [[Lake Champlain]] valley after the American victory in the [[American Revolutionary War]] - the centralized American authority proclaimed the area including and surrounding the old French trading areas and Iroquois settlement to be refounded as the settlement of Plattsburgh in 1785. Regardless, local residents exercised their unique French culture and history over the years in ways that are still visible today. In Plattsburgh, for example, there is no &quot;Main Street&quot; - a common vestige of English colonies, whereas in a unique tradition major streets and thoroughfares were named after the daughters of prominent businessman and politicians (e.g., Cathérine, Marguerite - present day Margaret Street and Plattsburgh's &quot;Main Street&quot;, Cornélie - present day Cornelia Street). In a similar fashion, local residents named local streets after renowned Frenchmen including [[Samuel de Champlain]], the original founder of the region, and General [[Louis-Joseph de Montcalm]] - the French general who gained fame defeating incredible numerical odds in multiple battles throughout both the Oswego and Hudson River Valley areas before going on to organize the last French defense of Québec at the [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham]]. The oldest monument within the city limits, in fact, is dedicated to Samuel de Champlain.

===Notable historical events===
The community set itself off from the Town of Plattsburgh by incorporating as a village in 1815.  The city government was established in the former village in 1902.

With its significant location on a major water thoroughfare and close to the [[U.S.-Canadian border]], Plattsburgh has been the site of a number of historic events including the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]]'s [[Battle of Valcour Island]] and the [[War of 1812]]'s [[Battle of Plattsburgh]]; the city has a [[War of 1812 Museum (Plattsburgh)|War of 1812 museum]].

[[Temple Beth Israel (Plattsburgh, New York)|Temple Beth Israel]] was established in 1861, and completed the construction of its current building in 1971.&lt;ref name=history&gt;[http://www.bethisraelplattsburgh.org/aboutus/history/ History], Synagogue website, About Us. Accessed October 19, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Plattsburgh Normal School was founded in 1889.  It burned in 1929, and was rebuilt in 1932. In 1948 it became [[State University of New York at Plattsburgh]].

In 1915, the [[Preparedness Movement]] established the first and best-known of its training camps for prospective military volunteers at Plattsburgh. The &quot;[[Citizens' Military Training Camp#Plattsburgh camps|Plattsburgh camps]]&quot; trained about 40,000 potential Army officers in the summers of 1915 and 1916.

During the Cold War, military functions took a prominent role in Plattsburgh, which was home to [[Plattsburgh Air Force Base]] (PAFB) and was the location of the [[Strategic Air Command]]'s primary wing on the U.S. East Coast due to its geographic desirability. The base's location in the [[Champlain Valley]] (protected by the [[rain shadow]] of the [[Adirondack Mountains]]) ensured consistent, year-round weather that was safe for take-offs and landings. The 380th Bombardment, Aerospace, and Refueling Wings, all stationed at PAFB, included [[B-52 Stratofortress|B-52 Bombers]], air-refueling &quot;tankers&quot; and [[FB-111]]s.  The base had a great deal of land surface and was one of only four military bases in the United States with a landing strip large enough for a [[Space Shuttle]] landing.

[[Image:Plattsburghb47.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A B-47 with the inscription &quot;Pride of the Adirondacks&quot; on display in the Clyde A. Lewis Air Park|A [[B-47]] bomber with the inscription &quot;Pride of the [[Adirondacks]]&quot;, one of two aircraft on display in the Clyde A. Lewis Air Park.]]

On September 1, 1961, the 556 Strategic Missile Squadron was activated at Plattsburgh AFB.
The Squadron consisted of 12 Atlas &quot;F&quot; Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles stored in underground silos at 12 sites surrounding the city of Plattsburgh. Ten of the silos were in New York, two across Lake Champlain in Vermont. The squadron played an active role in the 1962 Cuban Missile crisis, giving President Kennedy a powerful negotiating tool in dealing with Nikita Kruschev. The 556 SMS's life was relatively short lived since the Atlas was a liquid fuel system that was expensive and difficult to maintain. As the solid fuel Minuteman ICBM began to come on line, the liquid fueled missiles such as the Atlas and Titan were retired. The 556 SMS began inactivating in the spring of 1965, completing that task later that year.

Despite its numerous awards for performance excellence, PAFB was closed on September 29, 1995 in a round of national base closures in the early 1990s as the Air Force began to pare down its post-Cold War missions. The base property is now managed by the Plattsburgh Airbase Redevelopment Corporation (PARC) and is used by a number of industrial manufacturers and commercial airlines.

Because of the strategic weather advantage of the former PAFB site, as well as its relatively convenient access by air to the most remote parts of [[Upstate New York]], [[Hillary Rodham Clinton]] used the former airbase landing strip on her trips to campaign in the [[North Country (New York)|North Country]] region during her first term as a US Senator from New York in early 2002.

Throughout much of the 1980s, when the [[Canadian dollar]] was strong relative to the [[United States dollar|U.S. dollar]], Plattsburgh was a favorite tourist location for vacationers from Montreal and southern Quebec.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} [[Bilingual sign]]s, in [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]], are found in parts of the city.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} The city beaches and camp grounds were regularly crowded and Plattsburgh attracted enough retail stores and outlets to build a second large indoor [[shopping mall]], [[Champlain Centre North]], in addition to several outdoor shopping centers.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} The additional retail space of the Champlain Centre North along with the new Consumer Square (Walmart, Staples, TJ Maxx...) made the [[The Pyramid Companies|Pyramid Mall]] irrelevant; it was largely demolished (with exception of Kmart and the restored old Price Chopper building) and converted into a [[Power center (retail)|power center]] with a {{convert|115000|sqft|m2|-2|abbr=on}} Lowes Home Center and a new Price Chopper as the anchor stores. However, with the closing of PAFB and the strengthening U.S. dollar in the 1990s, Canadian tourism declined, although it has rebounded with the falling dollar of 2007.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}  Today, the city relies largely in part on new industries expanding on the former airbase as well as established manufacturing plants, such as [[Bombardier Transportation|Bombardier]],&lt;ref&gt;Bombardier website: [http://www.bombardier.com/en/corporate/about-us/worldwide-presence/usa?docID=0901260d80016cf1# Bombardier Transportation in the USA]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nova Bus]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novabus.com/about-us/facilities/plattsburgh.html Nova Bus Plattsburgh Factory]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Georgia-Pacific]] paper plant. The GP plant is housed in the former LOZIER Auto factory built in the early 20th century on the former (lakefront) Anderson Farm.

==Spelling of ''Plattsburgh''==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2007}}

Plattsburgh is sometimes mistakenly spelled as ''Plattsburg'', leaving off the ‹h›. Adding to the confusion are many historic documents relating to the famous naval engagement between the United States and Britain in 1814 which refer to the [[Battle of Plattsburgh|Battle of ''Plattsburg'']].

Compounding the confusion, in 1950 the editor of the New York State Legislative Manual, seeking to simplify the organization of that year's manual, requested a listing of state post offices from the [[United States Postal Service]]. Upon review of the listing, the difference in spelling was noted. The City was contacted and an investigation begun by postal authorities.

U.S. Postal Service records show that the name of the post office was changed to ''Plattsburg'', without the ‹h›, in 1894. During the period 1892-1894, the federal Post Office Department was growing at a rapid pace. The Postmaster General issued an order establishing guidelines for post office names for new post offices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usps.com/postalhistory/_rtf/PONames.rtf ]{{dead link|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archives.gov/publications/ref-info-papers/72/ ]{{dead link|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The order was misunderstood by local postal officials who caused the name of the village post to be changed to ''Plattsburg'', without the ‹h›. As a result of the 1951 investigation, the name of the city post office was changed back to ''Plattsburgh'', with the ‹h›. At no time was the name of the city itself ever changed.

To this day, some signs (including US and Canadian highway signs and a sign at the [[Plattsburgh (Amtrak station)]], among others) erroneously point the way to &quot;Plattsburg&quot;. There is also a bank with ''{{smallcaps|{{lc:PLATTSBURG BANK}}}}'' inscribed at the top.

==Transportation==
Plattsburgh is about 40 minutes away by car from Montreal, Quebec. Many people commute across the United States-Canada border, and the city advertises itself as &quot;Montreal's U.S. suburb&quot;. New York state is Quebec's largest trade partner, with about $6 billion in trade annually.&lt;ref name=&quot;harris20130621&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.northcountrypublicradio.org/news/story/22224/20130621/is-plattsburgh-montreal-s-u-s-suburb | title=Is Plattsburgh Montreal's U.S. suburb? | work=North Country Public Radio | date=2013-06-21 | accessdate=20 July 2013 | author=Harris, Sarah}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proximity leads to Plattsburgh's prominence as a large trade center for a city its size.

Bypassing Plattsburgh to the west is [[Interstate 87]], which connects Montreal with [[Albany, New York|Albany]] and points south. There are three main exits serving the city of Plattsburgh, with a fourth serving the [[Cumberland Head, New York|Cumberland Head]] district of the [[Plattsburgh (town), New York|town]].

Allegiant Air also utilizes Plattsburgh Int'l and offers direct flights to Fort Lauderdale and Orlando aboard mainline McDonnell-Douglas MD-88 regional jetliners, service to Las Vegas is seasonally offered by Allegiant using larger Boeing 757 airliners which are the largest commercial aircraft currently operating from the airport. The short lived ultra-low cost carrier Direct-Air used to offer flights from Plattsburgh to Lakeland-Linder Regional Airport in Lakeland, FL in Boeing 737s but stopped flights when the airline ceased operations. Spirit Airlines has recently announced new service to begin in 2011 with flights to Myrtle Beach on Airbus A320 and A319 jetliners.

==History==

=== Early history ===
The inhabitants of the Ithaca area at the time Europeans began arriving were the [[Saponi]] and [[Tutelo]]  Indians, dependent tribes of the [[Cayuga tribe|Cayuga Indians]] who formed part of the [[Iroquois|Iroquois confederation]].  These tribes had been allowed to settle on Cayuga-controlled hunting lands at the south end of [[Cayuga Lake]] as well as in Pony (originally Sapony) Hollow of [[Newfield, New York]], after being forced from [[North Carolina]] by European invasion. They were driven from the area by the [[Sullivan Expedition]] which destroyed the Tutelo village of Coregonal, located near the junction of state routes [[New York State Highway 13|13]] and [[New York State Route 13A|13A]] just south of the Ithaca city limits. Indian presence in the current City of Ithaca was limited to a temporary hunting camp at the base of Cascadilla Gorge. The destruction of [[Iroquois|Iroquois confederation]] power opened the region to settlement by people of European origin, a process which began in 1789.  In 1790, an official program began for distributing land in the area as a reward for service to the American soldiers of the Revolutionary War; most local land titles trace back to the Revolutionary war grants. Lots were drawn in 1791; informal settlement had already started.

=== Partition of the Military Tract ===
As part of this process, the [[Central New York Military Tract]], which included northern Tompkins County, was surveyed by Simeon DeWitt. His clerk [[Robert Harpur]] had a fondness for ancient Greek and Roman history as well as English authors and philosophers (as evidenced by the nearby townships of Dryden and Locke).  The Commissioners of Lands of New York State (chairman Gov. [[George Clinton (British politician)|George Clinton]]) followed Harpur's recommendations at a meeting in 1790. The Military Tract township in which proto-Ithaca was located he named the [[Ulysses, New York|Town of Ulysses]], the Latin form of the Greek [[Odysseus]] from Homer's Odyssey. A few years later DeWitt moved to Ithaca, then called variously &quot;The Flats,&quot; &quot;The City,&quot; or &quot;Sodom,&quot; and named it for the Greek island home of [[Odysseus|Ulysses]] (still the surrounding township at the time — nowadays Ulysses is a separate town in Tompkins County).  Contrary to popular myth, DeWitt did not name many of the classical references found in [[Upstate New York]] such as [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]] and [[Troy, New York|Troy]]; these were from the general classical fervor of the times.

=== The growth of Ithaca, village and city ===
[[File:State Street - Ithaca, New York.jpg|thumb|right|State Street in Ithaca, ca. 1901]]

In the 1820s and 1830, Ithaca held high hopes of becoming a major city when the primitive [[Ithaca and Owego Railroad]] was completed in 1832 to connect the [[Erie Canal]] navigation with the Susquehanna River to the south.  In 1821, the village set itself off by incorporation at the same time the Town of Ithaca parted with the parent town of Ulysses.  These hopes survived the depression of 1837 when the railroad was re-organized as the Cayuga &amp; Susquehanna and re-engineered with switchbacks in the late 1840s; much of this route is now used by the [[Trails in Ithaca, New York#South Hill Recreation Way|South Hill Recreation Way]]. However, easier routes soon became available, such as the Syracuse, Binghamton &amp; New York (1854). In the decade following the Civil War railroads were built from Ithaca to all surrounding points ([[Geneva, New York]]; [[Cayuga, New York]]; [[Cortland, New York]]; [[Elmira, New York]]; [[Athens, Pennsylvania]]) mainly with financing from [[Ezra Cornell]]; however, the geography of the city has always prevented it from lying on a major transportation artery.  When the [[Lehigh Valley Railroad]] later built its main line from Pennsylvania to Buffalo in 1890 it bypassed Ithaca (running via eastern [[Schuyler County, New York|Schuyler County]] on easier grades), as the [[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad]] had done in the 1850s.

The late nineteenth century gave birth to the two major postsecondary educational institutions Ithaca has today.  In 1865, [[Ezra Cornell]] founded [[Cornell University]].  It was opened as a [[coeducational]] institution, which was extremely unusual at the time; women first enrolled in 1870.  Ezra Cornell also established a [[Cornell Public Library|public library]] for the city. [[Ithaca College]] was founded as the Ithaca Conservatory of Music in 1892.  Ithaca College was originally located in the downtown area, but due to lack of space it relocated to South Hill in the 1960s.

Ithaca became a city in 1888 and emerged as a small manufacturing and retail center.  Notably the  [[Ithaca Gun Factory]] opened in 1880.  The largest industrial company (and associated building) in the area was Morse Chain, elements of which were absorbed into [[Emerson Electric Company|Emerson]] Power Transmission on South Hill and [[BorgWarner|Borg Warner Automotive]] in [[Lansing (town), New York|Lansing, New York]]. In the post-World War II decades, [[National Cash Register]] and the [[Langmuir Research Lab]]s of [[General Electric]] were also major employers.

During the early 20th century, Ithaca was an important center in the [[silent film]] industry. The most common type of film produced was the [[cliffhanger]] [[Serial (film)|serial]]. These films often featured the local natural scenery. Many of these films were the work of [[Leopold Wharton]] and his brother [[Theodore Wharton]] in their [[The Whartons Studio|studio]] on the site of what is now [[Stewart Park]]. Eventually the film industry centralized in Hollywood, which offered the possibility of year-round filming, and film production in Ithaca effectively ceased. Few of the silent films made in Ithaca are preserved today.

==Geography and climate==
[[File:Ithaca Hemlock Gorge.JPG|thumb|300px|Hemlock Gorge along Fall Creek before emptying into Beebe Lake on Cornell's campus.]]

The valley in which Cayuga Lake is located is long and narrow with a north-south orientation. Ithaca is at the southern end (the &quot;head&quot;) of the lake, but the valley continues to the southwest behind the city. Originally a river valley, it was deepened and widened by the action of Pleistocene ice sheets over the last several hundred thousand years. The lake, which drains to the north, formed behind a dam of glacial [[moraine]]. The rock is predominantly [[Devonian]] and, north of Ithaca, is relatively fossil rich. [[Glacial erratic]]s can be found in the area. The world-renowned fossils found in this area can be examined at the [[Museum of the Earth]].

Ithaca was founded on flat land just south of the lake — land that formed in fairly recent geological times when silt filled the southern end of the lake.  The city ultimately spread to the adjacent hillsides, which rise several hundred feet above the central flats:  East Hill, West Hill, and South Hill. Its sides are fairly steep, and a number of the streams that flow into the valley from east or west have cut deep canyons, usually with several [[waterfall]]s.

Ithaca experiences a moderate [[continental climate]]. Winters are long, cold, and snowy, with temperatures reaching {{convert|0|°F|0}} or lower on an average 9.9 nights annually and an average of {{convert|67|in|cm|abbr=on}} of snow per season. The largest snowfall in one day was {{convert|26.0|in|cm|abbr=on}} on February 14, 1914. Summers are warm and humid, with usually comfortable temperatures. Readings of {{convert|90|°F|0}} or higher occur on an average of just 5.2 days per year, and {{convert|100|°F|0}}+ temperatures have only occurred ten times since record-keeping began in 1893. The average date of the first freeze is October 5, and the average date of the last freeze is May 15, giving Ithaca a [[growing season]] of 141 days. The average date of the first and last snowfalls are November 12 and April 7, respectively. Extreme temperatures range from {{convert|−25|°F|0}} as recently as February 2, 1961 up to {{convert|103|°F|0}} on July 9, 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nws.noaa.gov/climate/xmacis.php?wfo=bgm |title=NowData - NOAA Online Weather Data |publisher=NOAA |accessdate=2011-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The valley flatland has slightly milder weather in winter, and occasionally Ithacans experience simultaneous snow on the hills and rain in the valley.  The phenomenon of mixed precipitation (rain, wind, and snow), common in the late fall and early spring, is known tongue-in-cheek as ''ithacation'' to many of the local residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tompkinsready.org/disaster/winter.html |title=Winter Weather |publisher=TompkinsREADY |date= |accessdate=2010-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The natural vegetation of the Ithaca area, seen in areas unbuilt and unfarmed, is northern [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests|temperate broadleaf forest]], dominated by [[deciduous plant|deciduous trees]].

Due to the [[microclimate]]s created by the impact of the lakes, the region surrounding Ithaca ([[Finger Lakes]] [[American Viticultural Area]]) experiences a short but adequate growing season for winemaking.  As such the region is home to many wineries.

==Education==

[[File:Cornell University from McGraw Tower.JPG|thumb|right|Cornell University from McGraw Tower]]

Ithaca is a major educational center in [[Central New York]]. The city is home to [[Cornell University]] which overlooks the town from East Hill, and [[Ithaca College]], situated on South Hill. The [[College town|student population]] is very high as there are currently more than 20,000 students enrolled at Cornell, with an additional 6,300 students at Ithaca College.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dpb.cornell.edu/documents/1000172.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tompkins Cortland Community College]] is located in the neighboring town of [[Dryden (town), New York|Dryden, New York]], and has an extension center in downtown Ithaca. [[Empire State College]] offers non-traditional college courses to adults in downtown Ithaca.

The [[Ithaca City School District]], which encompasses Ithaca and the surrounding area, enrolls about 5,500 K-12 students in eight elementary schools, two middle schools, [[Ithaca High School (Ithaca, New York)|Ithaca High School]], and the [[Lehman Alternative Community School]], which provides its students wide-ranging freedom to choose their own curriculum. There are also several private elementary and secondary schools in the Ithaca area, including [[Immaculate Conception School (Ithaca)|Immaculate Conception School]], the [[Cascadilla School]], the [[New Roots Charter School]], the Elizabeth Ann Clune Montessori School, and the Ithaca Waldorf School. Ithaca has two networks for supporting its home-schooling families: Loving Education At Home (LEAH) and the Northern Light Learning Center (NLLC).

Ithaca draws students from around the United States and the rest of the world with its various vocational schools and specialty institutes, such as the 1000-hour program at the [[Finger Lakes School of Massage]]. Ithaca's [[Suzuki Method|Suzuki]] school Ithaca Talent Education provides musical training for children of all ages and also teacher training for undergraduate and graduate-level students. The Community School of Music and Art uses an extensive scholarship system to offer classes and lessons to any student, regardless of age, background, economic status or artistic ability.

==Economy==
The economy of Ithaca is based on education and manufacturing with high tech and tourism in strong supporting roles. As of 2006, Ithaca remains one of the few expanding economies in economically troubled New York State outside of New York City, and draws commuters from the neighboring rural counties of [[Cortland County, New York|Cortland]], [[Tioga County, New York|Tioga]], and [[Schuyler County, New York|Schuyler]], as well as from the more urbanized [[Chemung County, New York|Chemung County]].

With some level of success, Ithaca has tried to maintain a traditional downtown shopping area that includes the [[Ithaca Commons]] pedestrian mall and Center Ithaca, a small mixed-use complex built at the end of the urban renewal era. Some in the community regret that downtown has lost vitality to two expanding commercial zones to the northeast and southwest of the old city. These areas contain an increasing number of large retail stores and restaurants run by national chains. Others say the chain stores boost local shopping options for residents considerably, many of whom would have previously shopped elsewhere, while increasing sales tax revenue for the city and county. Still others note that the stores, restaurants, and businesses that remain in downtown are not necessarily in direct competition with the larger chain stores. The tradeoff between sprawl and economic development continues to be debated throughout the city and the surrounding area. (Another commercial center, Collegetown, is located next to the Cornell campus. It features a number of restaurants, shops, and bars, and an increasing number of high rise apartments and is primarily frequented by [[Cornell University]] students.)

Ithaca has many of the businesses characteristic of small American university towns: used bookstores, art house cinemas, craft stores, and vegetarian-friendly restaurants. The collective [[Moosewood Restaurant]], founded in 1973, was the wellspring for a number of vegetarian cookbooks; [[Bon Appetit]] magazine ranked it among the thirteen most influential restaurants of the 20th century.  It is claimed locally that Ithaca has more restaurants per capita than New York City.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lawschool.cornell.edu/admissions/ithaca/visitus/restaurants.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; Ithaca has many local restaurants and chains both in the city and town with a range of ethnic foods. The innovative and popular Ithaca Bakery chain, and the Ithaca Farmers Market&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ithacamarket.com/ |title=Ithaca Farmers Market |publisher=Ithacamarket.com |date=2009-05-16 |accessdate=2010-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; also provide a range of foods.

[[File:Human Peace Sign.jpg|thumb|300px|An aerial view of Stewart Park as 6,000 Ithaca residents set the unofficial world record for the largest human peace sign in June, 2008.]]
==Culture==
Ithacans support the Ithaca Farmers Market, professional theaters ([[Kitchen Theatre Company]], Hangar Theatre, Icarus Theatre), a civic [[orchestra]], much parkland, the [[Sciencenter]], a hands-on science museum for people of all ages, an independent movie theater ([[Cinemapolis]]), and the [[Museum of the Earth]]. Ithaca is noted for its annual artistic celebration of community: The [[Ithaca Festival]] (and its parade), the [[Circus Eccentrithaca]].  The [[Constance Saltonstall Foundation for the Arts]] provides grants and Summer Fellowships at the [[Saltonstall Arts Colony]] for New York State artists and writers. Ithaca also hosts what is described as the third-largest [[Friends of the Tompkins County Library Book Sale|used-book sale]] in the United States.

Other festivals occur annually, usually centered around food, music, and/or spirits.  These include The Apple Festival in the fall, with many different varieties of apples and apple products; Chili Fest in February, a local contest involving many local restaurants who compete to make the best chili in several different categories; the Finger Lakes International Dragon Boat Festival in July; Porchfest in late September, which includes an eclectic mix of local musicians performing throughout the day on an array of porches in Fall Creek homes; and Ithaca Brew Fest in [[Stewart Park]] in September, usually featuring tastings of over 100 varieties of beer from regional, national, and international Craft brewers, food from local vendors, and music from local bands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.ithacabrewfest.com |title = Home |publisher = ithacabrewfest.com |accessdate = 2013-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2008, local peace activist [[Trevor Dougherty]] led almost 6,000 members of the Ithaca community in forming a giant human peace sign. This event took part during the Ithaca Festival, making Ithaca the unofficial home of the world's largest human peace sign.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2008/06/in_ithaca_6000_give_peace_a_ch.html In Ithaca, 6,000 give peace a chance], The Post-Standard&lt;/ref&gt;

In August, Women's Swimmin' has a swim across [[Cayuga Lake]] to raise money for Hospicare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.womenswimmin.org/swimmers.mgi |title=Women Swimmin' – Swimmer Information |publisher=Womenswimmin.org |date=2008-05-25 |accessdate=2010-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ithaca has also pioneered the [[Ithaca Health Fund]], a popular cooperative health insurance. Ithaca is also home to one of the United States' first [[local currency]] systems, [[Ithaca Hours]], developed by [[Paul Glover]] (building on the pioneering work of [[Ralph Borsodi]] and [[Robert Swann (land trust pioneer)|Robert Swann]]).

It is claimed locally that in 1891, Rev. John M. Scott and a local druggist, [[Chester Platt]], invented the [[Sundae|ice cream sundae]] in Ithaca,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theithacajournal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070626/NEWS01/706260304/1002 ''The Ithaca Journal''  &quot;New intel in the sundae wars: IHS grads scoop up ice cream facts&quot; June 26, 2007.

Scott preached, has an annual &quot;Sundae Sunday&quot; every September in commemoration.

=== Music and musicians ===
Ithaca is known for its resident musicians, who contribute to a music scene which is unusually talented and diverse for such a small town.  These musicians have come from many backgrounds to pursue their careers in Ithaca; the School of Music at Ithaca College attracts talented musicians, some of whom remain in Ithaca after graduating and take up work as performing musicians or in the sound engineering field. Ithaca is the seat of the ''Official Orchestra of the City of Ithaca'', commonly known under the name [[Cayuga Chamber Orchestra]].

Several notable musicians have relocated from other countries to Ithaca in order to begin their careers, most notably [[Samite (musician)|Samite]] of Uganda, [[Mamadou Diabaté]] of Mali and Malang Jobateh of Senegal.  Other regionally, nationally and internationally known performers and musical groups that call Ithaca home include: [[Donna the Buffalo]], [[The Burns Sisters]], jazz cellist [[Hank Roberts]], [[Johnny Dowd]], Jimkata, [[John Brown's Body (band)|John Brown's Body]], Ayurveda, The Gunpoets, The Blind Spots, [[The Sim Redmond Band]], Nate &amp; Kate, [[The Horse Flies]], Technicolor Trailer Park, Mike Brindisi &amp; The New York Rock, Who You Are, Willie B, and [[Kevin Kinsella]].  Traditional folk music is a staple and is featured weekly on North America's longest running live folk concert broadcast [[WVBR-FM|WVBR 93.5 FM's]] Bound for Glory.

In the nearby village of Trumansburg, the [[Finger Lakes Grassroots Festival of Music and Dance]] is held every third week in July.  Initiated as a benefit for Aids research at the State Theater in Ithaca by the band [[Donna the Buffalo]], it has successfully occurred every year for the past 20 years.  The Grassroots Festival has brought hundreds and hundreds of bands through the region, further enriching the local musical palate with every new introduction of musical style and culture.  Several local bands call it home as either a figurative birthplace or a nurturing environment within which to develop new forms of music.  Other notable local music festivals include the Ithaca Festival, Musefest, the Summertime Block Party, the Juneteenth Celebration and Rock the Arts.

===Media===
[[File:ClintonHouseInIthacaNY.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The [[Clinton House (Ithaca, New York)|Clinton House]], a 19th-century building in downtown Ithaca]]
The dominant [[local newspaper]] in Ithaca is a morning daily, The ''[[Ithaca Journal]]'', founded 1815.  The paper is owned by [[Gannett]], Inc., publishers of ''[[USA Today]]''.  The [[Alternative newspaper|alternative weekly]] newspaper ''[[Ithaca Times]]'' is distributed free of charge. Other area publications include ''[[Tompkins Weekly]]'', the ''[[Ithaca Community News]]'',  ''[[14850 Magazine]]'', the ''[[Cornell Daily Sun]]'', the ''[[Ithacan]]'', and the ''[[Tattler (student newspaper)|Tattler]]''. (The latter three are run by student staffs at Cornell University, Ithaca College, and Ithaca High School, respectively.)

Ithaca is also home to several radio stations. [[WVBR]] 93.5 FM is associated with [[Cornell University]] in the sense that it is owned and predominantly staffed by an association composed of enrolled Cornell students; but it is an independent, financially self-supporting commercial station in the rock format playing a mix of modern and classic rock during the week and specialty shows on the weekend. [[WICB]] 91.7 FM is an award-winning, non-commercial, student-run station owned by [[Ithaca College]]. The Cayuga Radio Group, a subsidiary of [[Saga Communications, Inc.]], owns country [[WQNY]] &quot;Q-Country&quot; 103.7 FM, [[WYXL]] &quot;Lite Rock&quot; 97.3 FM, news/talk [[WHCU]] 870 AM, progressive talk [[WNYY]] 1470 AM, as well as classic rock &quot;I-100&quot; [[WIII (FM)|WIII]] 99.9 FM, with its main transmitter in [[Cortland, New York|Cortland]] and a repeating station at 100.3 FM in Ithaca.  Saga also has lower-powered &quot;translator&quot; stations &quot;Hits 103.3&quot; and &quot;98.7 The Vine&quot; on the FM dial.  [[WFIZ]] &quot;Z95.5&quot; is also in the area, broadcasting a top-40, CHR format.  Classic rock &quot;The Wall&quot; WLLW 99.3 and 96.3, based in [[Seneca Falls (village), New York|Seneca Falls]], has a transmitter in Ithaca.  There is also NPR and classical programming available on WSQG 90.9 FM, NPR/college programming on WEOS repeater 88.1 FM, and Christian music and talk Family Life Network on 88.9 FM.

===Politics===
Politically, the city's population has a significant tilt toward [[American liberalism|liberalism]] and the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. A November 2004 study by [[ePodunk]] lists it as New York's most liberal town.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epodunk.com/top10/liberal/index.html ePodunk]&lt;/ref&gt; This contrasts with the more [[American conservatism|conservative]] leanings of the surrounding [[Upstate New York]] region, and is also somewhat more liberal than the rest of [[Tompkins County]]. In 1988, [[Jesse Jackson]] received the most votes in Ithaca in the Democratic Presidential primary.  In 2000, [[Ralph Nader]] received more votes for President than [[George W. Bush]] in the City of Ithaca,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Harlin, Kevin|title=Tompkins Greens express no regrets|work=[[Ithaca Journal]]|date=2000-11-09|page=1A}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 11% county-wide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elections.ny.gov/NYSBOE/elections/2000/wpres2000.pdf 2000 presidential general election results], New York State Board of Elections&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, [[Barack Obama]], running against New York State's Senator Hillary Clinton, won [[Tompkins County]] in the Democratic Presidential Primary, the only county that he won in New York State.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elections.ny.gov/NYSBOE/Elections/2008/Primary/PP-DEM-PRES-2008.pdf 2008 presidential primary election results], New York State Board of Elections&lt;/ref&gt;  Obama went on to win Tompkins County (including Ithaca) by a wide margin of 41% over his opponent John McCain in the November 2008 election.

==Local government==
The name Ithaca designates two governmental entities in the area, the [[Ithaca (town), New York|Town of Ithaca]] and the [[Ithaca (city), New York|City of Ithaca]].

The Town of Ithaca is one of the nine towns comprising [[Tompkins County]].  (Towns in New York are something like townships in other states; every county outside New York City is subdivided into towns.)  The City of Ithaca is surrounded by, but legally independent of, the Town. The Town of Ithaca contains the [[Cayuga Heights|Village of Cayuga Heights]], a small incorporated upper-middle class suburb located to the northeast of the City of Ithaca.

The City of Ithaca has a [[mayor-council government]]. The charter of the City of Ithaca provides for a full-time mayor and city judge, each independent and elected at large. Since 1995, the mayor has been elected to a four-year term, and since 1989, the city judge has been elected to a six-year term. Since 1983, the city has been divided into five wards, each electing two members to the city council, known as the Common Council, for staggered four-year terms.

The Town government consists of an executive, the Town Supervisor, elected to a four-year term, and a Town Council of five members also elected for terms of four years.

The majority of local property taxes are actually assessed by an entirely independent agency with entirely different borders, the [[Ithaca City School District]].

===City-Town consolidation===
In December 2005, the City and Town governments began discussing opportunities for increased government consolidation, including the possibility of joining the two into a single entity. This topic had been previously discussed in 1963 and 1969.

The possibility of consolidation is controversial for Town residents who could be forced to pay higher taxes as they help shoulder the higher debt burden that the City has taken on. Some Town residents also worry that consolidation could lead to increased sprawl and traffic congestion. However, most of the Town's population is already concentrated in [[Hamlet (New York)|hamlets]] in proximity to the City's borders and Town residents take advantage of City amenities. Mayor [[Walter Lynn]] of the Village of Cayuga Heights (an affluent Ithaca suburb located in the Town) called consolidation discussion a &quot;waste of time.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=15995648&amp;BRD=1395&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=216620&amp;rfi=6 Ithaca Times – A Greater Ithaca?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===
Ithaca is in the rural [[Finger Lakes]] region about 225 miles to the northwest of New York City; the nearest larger cities, [[Binghamton, New York|Binghamton]] and [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], are an hour's drive away by car, [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]] and [[Scranton, PA|Scranton]] are two hours, [[Buffalo, NY|Buffalo]] is three.

Ithaca is served by [[Ithaca Tompkins Regional Airport]], located about three miles to the northeast of the city center.  [[US Airways Express]] offers flights to its hub at [[Philadelphia International Airport|Philadelphia]] using a mixture of small jets and propeller craft. [[Delta Air Lines]] provides thrice-daily jet service to its hub at [[Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport|Detroit Metro]] airport and [[Continental Connection]] offers three daily [[turboprop]] flights to [[Newark Liberty International Airport]]. Some residents choose to travel to [[Syracuse Hancock International Airport]], [[Greater Binghamton Airport]], [[Elmira-Corning Regional Airport]] or [[Greater Rochester International Airport]] for more airline service options.

Ithaca lies at over a half hour's drive from any [[interstate highway]], and all car trips to Ithaca involve some driving on two-lane state rural highways.  The city is at the convergence of many regional two-lane state highways: Routes [[New York State Route 13|13]], [[New York State Route 13A|13A]], [[New York State Route 34|34]], [[New York State Route 79|79]], [[New York State Route 89|89]], [[New York State Route 96|96]], [[New York State Route 96B|96B]], and [[New York State Route 366|366]]. These are usually not congested except in Ithaca proper. There is frequent intercity bus service by [[Greyhound Lines]], New York Trailways, and Shortline (Coach USA), particularly to [[Binghamton, New York|Binghamton]] and New York City, with limited service to [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] and [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], and (via connections in [[Binghamton, New York|Binghamton]]) to Utica and Albany. The bus station serving all these companies&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greyhound.com/en/locations/terminal.aspx?city=150898 Ithaca Greyhound Station]&lt;/ref&gt; is the former Delaware, Lackawanna &amp; Western [[railway station]] on Meadow St.  between W State and W Seneca streets, a little over half a mile west of downtown Ithaca. Cornell University runs a premium [http://transportation.fs.cornell.edu/coach/ Campus to Campus] bus between its Ithaca campus and its medical school in New York City which is open to the public.

Ithaca is the center of an extensive bus public transportation system — [[Tompkins Consolidated Area Transit]] (TCAT) — which carried 3.1 million passengers in 2005.{{dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcatbus.com/announce2.htm &quot;3 Million Bus Passengers and Counting as TCAT Sets Record in 2005&quot;], Tompkins Consolidated Area Transit (TCAT), December 19, 2005. Retrieved March 24, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  TCAT was reorganized as a non-profit corporation in 2004 and is primarily supported locally by Cornell University, the City of Ithaca and Tompkins County.  TCAT operates 39 routes, many running seven days a week.  It has frequent service to downtown, Cornell, Ithaca College, and the Pyramid Mall in the neighboring Town of [[Lansing (town), New York|Lansing]], but less frequent service to many residential and rural areas, including [[Trumansburg, New York|Trumansburg]] and [[Newfield, New York|Newfield]]. [[Chemung County Transit]] runs weekday commuter routes into [[Schuyler County, New York|Schuyler]] and [[Chemung County, New York|Chemung]] counties, and [[Tioga County Public Transit]] runs weekday routes into neighboring [[Tioga County, New York|Tioga]], primarily to serve Cornell employees who prefer to live in these rural counties, or are forced to because of the high house prices near Ithaca.

GADABOUT Transportation Services, Inc. provides demand-response paratransit service for seniors over 60 and people with disabilities. [http://www.ithacataxi.biz/ Ithaca Dispatch] provides local and regional [http://collegetowncab.com/pages/home taxi service]. In addition, Ithaca Airline Limousine and [http://ithacar.com/ IthaCar Service] connect to the local airports.

In July 2008, a non-profit called [http://www.ithacacarshare.org/ Ithaca Carshare] began a [[carsharing]] service in Ithaca. Ithaca Carshare has a fleet of 23 vehicles shared by over 1300 members as of March 2013 and has become a popular service among both city residents and the college communities. Vehicles are located throughout Ithaca downtown and the two major institutions. With Ithaca Carshare as the first locally run carsharing organization in New York State, others have since launched in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] and [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]]. Independent studies have shown that for each Ithaca Carshare vehicle in the fleet, 15 fewer personally owner cars are owned.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

[[Norfolk Southern]] freight trains reach Ithaca from [[Sayre, Pennsylvania]], mainly to deliver coal to [[AES Corporation|AES]] Cayuga, a coal power plant (known as Milliken Station during NYSEG ownership) and haul out salt from the Cargill salt mine, both on the east shore of Cayuga Lake. There is no passenger rail service, although from the 1870s through the 1950s there were trains to Buffalo via [[Geneva, New York]]; to New York City via [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania]] ([[Lehigh Valley Railroad]]) and [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]] ([[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad|DL&amp;W]]);  to [[Auburn, New York]]; and to the [[Northeastern United States|US northeast]] via [[Cortland, New York]]; service to Buffalo and New York City lasted until 1961.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Hardy Campbell (2008) (2nd ed.; first ed. 1977) A History of Railroads in Tompkins County. Revised and enlarged by Winton Rossiter, maps by David Rossiter. Ithaca, NY: The History Center in Tompkins County&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.roadrunner.com/~nrw/history/railways.html &quot;Ithaca had its own 19th century railway rush&quot;], D G Rossiter, The Ithaca Journal, Centennial edition, Friday, 08-April-1988 . Last Accessed on 16-May-2010&lt;/ref&gt; The Lehigh Valley's top New York City-Ithaca-Buffalo passenger train, &quot;The Black Diamond&quot;, was optimistically publicized as 'The Handsomest Train in the World', perhaps to compensate for its roundabout route to Buffalo. It was named after the railroad's largest commodity, [[anthracite]] coal.

Ithaca was the fourth community in New York state with a street railway; streetcars ran from 1887 to summer 1935.&lt;ref&gt;Kerr, Richard D. (1972) The Ithaca Street Railway, Forty Fort, PA: Howard D. Cox&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.roadrunner.com/~nrw/history/street.html &quot;Street cars preceded local bus lines&quot;], D G Rossiter, The Ithaca Journal, Centennial edition, Friday, 08-April-1988 . Last Accessed on 16-May-2010&lt;/ref&gt;

As a growing urban area, Ithaca is facing steady increases in levels of vehicular traffic on the city grid and on the state highways. Outlying areas have limited bus service, and many people consider a car essential. However, many consider Ithaca a walkable and bikeable community. One positive trend for the health of downtown Ithaca is the new wave of increasing urban density in and around the Ithaca Commons. Because the downtown area is the region's central business district, dense mixed-use development that includes housing may increase the proportion of people who can walk to work and recreation, and mitigate the likely increased pressure on already busy roads as Ithaca grows. The downtown area is also the area best served by frequent public transportation. Still, traffic congestion around the Commons is likely to progressively increase.

Like many small college towns, Ithaca has also received accolades for having a high overall quality of life. In 2004, ''Cities Ranked and Rated'' named Ithaca the best &quot;emerging city&quot; to live in the United States.

In its earliest years during frontier days, what is now Ithaca was briefly known by the names &quot;The Flats&quot; and &quot;Sodom,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;hoiatc&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dr. James Sullivan, [http://www.usgennet.org/usa/ny/state/his/bk7/ch7.html &quot;The History of New York State&quot;], ''Book VII: [http://www.usgennet.org/usa/ny/state/his/bk7/index.html &quot;The Finger Lakes Region&quot;], Chapter VII: Tompkins County''.

These names did not last long; [[Simeon DeWitt]] renamed the town Ithaca in the early 19th century, though nearby [[Robert H. Treman State Park]] still contains Lucifer Falls.

'''Schenectady''' {{IPAc-en|s|k|ɨ|ˈ|n|ɛ|k|t|ə|d|i}} is a [[City (New York)|city]] in [[Schenectady County, New York|Schenectady County]], [[New York]], [[United States]], of which it is the county seat. As of the [[United States Census 2010|2010 census]], the city had a population of 66,135. The name &quot;Schenectady&quot; is derived loosely from a [[Mohawk language|Mohawk]] word for &quot;on that side of the pinery,&quot; or &quot;near the pines,&quot; or &quot;place beyond the pine plains.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Pearson et al.,  [http://www.schenectadyhistory.org/resources/patent/19.html A History of the Schenectady Patent in the Dutch and English Times], 30 July 2009.  Retrieved on 28 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

It is in eastern [[New York]], near the confluence of the [[Mohawk River|Mohawk]] and [[Hudson River]]s. It is in the same [[Capital District|metropolitan area]] as the state capital, [[Albany, New York|Albany]], about {{convert|19|mi|km}} south-east.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dot.ny.gov/design/milage-map2.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
When first encountered by Europeans, the area that is now Schenectady was the land of the [[Mohawk nation]] of the [[Iroquois]] Confederacy. When Dutch settlers arrived in the Hudson Valley in the 17th century, the Mohawk called the settlement at [[Fort Orange]] (present day [[Albany, NY]]) ''Schau-naugh-ta-da'', meaning &quot;over the pine plains.&quot; Eventually, this word entered the lexicon of the Dutch settlers, but the meaning was reversed, and the name referred to the bend in the Mohawk River where the city lies today.

Schenectady was first settled by Europeans in 1661 when the area was part of the Dutch colony of [[New Netherland]]. Settlement was led by [[Arent van Curler]], a prominent figure in the colony who had emigrated from [[Nijkerk]] in the [[Netherlands]], after purchase from the Mohawk Nation. Some of the Dutch brought [[African]] [[slaves]] to the region as laborers, as did the later English. In 1664 the English seized the Dutch colony and renamed it [[New York]]. Settlers purchased additional land from the Mohawk in 1670 and 1672. Twenty years later (1684) Governor [[Thomas Dongan]] granted letters patent for Schenectady to five trustees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schenectadyhistory.org/resources/patent/05.html &quot;Schenectady Digital History Archive&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 8, 1690, during [[King William's War]], French forces and their [[Native American (U.S.)|Indian]] allies attacked Schenectady by surprise, leaving 62 dead. American history notes it as the [[Schenectady massacre]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~vanepsgenealogy/schmass.html &quot;The Schenectady Massacre: Settlers Killed and Captured&quot;], Freepages, Rootsweb&lt;/ref&gt; In 1748, during [[King George's War]], the French and Indians attacked again. 

In 1765, Schenectady was incorporated as a borough. [[Union College]] was founded in 1795. During the [[American Revolutionary War]] the local militia unit, the [[2nd Albany County Militia Regiment]], fought in the [[Battle of Saratoga]] and against [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] troops. Most of the warfare in the Mohawk Valley occurred farther west on the frontier.

The settlement was chartered as a city in 1798. In the 19th century, after completion of the Erie Canal in 1825, Schenectady became an important transportation and trade center, as it was part of connecting the Hudson River to the [[Mohawk Valley]] and the [[Great Lakes]].  The [[New York State Route 5|Albany and Schenectady Turnpike]] (now State Street), established in 1797, connected Albany to the Mohawk Valley.  The [[Erie Canal]] (now Erie Boulevard), opened in 1825, passed through here, as did the [[Albany and Schenectady Railroad|Mohawk and Hudson Railroad]], opened in 1831 as one of the first railway lines in the United States. Commodities and commercial products were shipped to the East and New York City through the Mohawk Valley and Schenectady.

In the antebellum years, Schenectady became a center of [[abolitionist]] activities. The last slaves in New York did not gain freedom until 1827, although the state had passed a gradual emancipation act in 1799, which first freed the children of slaves. [[Union College]] had established a school for black children in 1805, but discontinued it after two years. Parents had been unsuccessful in having their children admitted to public schools in the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wright&quot;/&gt; In 1836, Rev. [[Isaac Groot Duryea]] was a co-founder of the interracial Anti-Slavery Society at Union College. An [[Underground Railroad]] route ran through the area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.valecemetery.org/african-american-history &quot;African-American History&quot;], Historic Vale Cemetery, 2000-2011, accessed 31 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 1837, Duryea helped found the [[First Free Church of Schenectady]] together with other [[free people of color]]; it provided space in the basement for a school for their children. The [[abolitionist]] [[Theodore Sedgwick Wright]], who was based in New York City, spoke at the dedication of the church.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wright&quot;&gt;[http://research.udmercy.edu/find/special_collections/digital/baa/item.php?record_id=1360&amp;collectionCode=baa Theodore Sedgwick Wright, &quot;Speech given during the dedication of the First Free Church of Schenectady, 28 December 1837&quot;], ''Emancipator'', at University of Detroit Mercy, accessed 31 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1887, [[Thomas Edison]] moved his Edison Machine Works to Schenectady. In 1892, Schenectady became the headquarters of the [[General Electric Company]]. It became a major economic force and helped establish the city and region as a manufacturing center. GE became important nationally as a creative company. 

Schenectady is home to [[WGY (AM)|WGY-AM]], the second commercial radio station in the United States, (after [[WBZA|WBZ]] in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], which was named for [[Westinghouse Broadcasting|Westinghouse]].) The station was named for its owner, General Electric (the G), and the city of Schenectady (the Y).&lt;ref&gt;Brian Belanger,''Radio &amp; Television Museum News'', [http://www.radiohistory.org/newsdocs/newsletter/WGYarticle.pdf &quot;Radio Station WGY&quot;]{{dead link|date=December 2012}}, Radio History, February 2006. Retrieved on December 1, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928, General Electric produced the first regular television broadcasts in the United States, when the experimental station W2XB began regular broadcasts on Thursday and Friday afternoons. This television station is now [[WRGB]]; for years it was the Capital District's [[NBC]] affiliate, but is now the [[CBS]] affiliate.

==Geography==
Schenectady is located at {{Coord|42|48|N|73|56|W|type:city}} (42.8041, −73.9293).{{GR|1}} The altitude above sea level is {{convert|211|to|275|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}}.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|11.0|sqmi|km2|2}}, of which, {{convert|10.9|sqmi|km2|2}} of it is land and {{convert|0.1|sqmi|km2}} of it (1.27%) is water.

It is part of the [[Capital District]], the metropolitan area surrounding [[Albany, New York|Albany]], New York state's capital. Along with Albany and [[Troy, New York|Troy]], it is one of the three principal population and industrial centers in the region.

==Economy==
[[File:GE Schenectady.JPG|thumb|Former GE headquarters building]]
The city was a manufacturing center known as &quot;The City that Lights and Hauls the World&quot; – a reference to two prominent businesses in the city, the Edison Electric Company (now known as [[General Electric]]), and the [[American Locomotive Company]] (ALCO). GE retains its administrative core in Schenectady, but it relocated thousands of manufacturing jobs to the [[Sun Belt]] and abroad. ALCO produced steam locomotives for railroads for years, and then in the later years became famous for its &quot;Superpower&quot; line of high-pressure locomotives, such as those for the Union Pacific Railroad in the 1930s and 1940s, and made tanks in the Second World War. As diesel locomotives began to appear, ALCO joined with GE to develop diesel locomotives to compete with the EMD division of General Motors. But corporate restructuring to cope with the changing locomotive procurement environment saw the slow downward spiral of ALCO.  Its operations fizzled as the company went through acquisitions and restructuring in the late 1960s. Its Schenectady plant closed in 1969. In the late 20th century, the city experienced difficult financial times, as did many upstate New York former manufacturing cities. The loss of employment caused Schenectady's population to decline by nearly one-third since 1950. 

In the 21st century, Schenectady began revitalization. GE's establishing a renewable energy center brought hundreds of employees to the area.  It is part of a metropolitan area with improving economic health, and buildings have been renovated for new uses.  Numerous small businesses, retail stores and restaurants have developed on State Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/01/nyregion/01unioncollege.html?scp=1&amp;sq=union%20college%20finally%20admits%20where%20its%20at&amp;st=cse | work=The New York Times | title=Union College Finally Admits Where It Is | first=Lisa W. | last=Foderaro | date=February 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[per capita income]] for the city was $17,076. About 20.2% of families and 25.9% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 41.5% of those under age 18 and 5.6% of those age 65 or over.

==Rail transportation==
[[Amtrak]], the national passenger rail system, provides regular service to Schenectady to a [[Schenectady (Amtrak station)|station]] at 322 Erie Boulevard. Schenectady also has freight rail service from [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] and [[CSX Transportation]].

Schenectady had a local [[streetcar]] system and electric interurban passenger service.  The Schenectady Railway Co. had local lines and interurban lines serving Albany, [[Ballston Spa, NY|Ballston Spa]], [[Saratoga Springs, NY|Saratoga Springs]] and [[Troy, NY|Troy]].  There was also a line from [[Gloversville, New York|Gloversville]], [[Johnstown (city), New York|Johnstown]], [[Amsterdam (city), New York|Amsterdam]], and [[Scotia, New York|Scotia]] into [[Downtown Schenectady]] operated by the [[Fonda, New York|Fonda]], Johnstown, and Gloversville Railroad. The nearly 200 leather and glove companies (178) in the Gloversville region generated considerable traffic for the line. Sales representatives carrying product sample cases would begin their sales campaigns throughout the rest of the country by taking the interurban to reach Schenectady's New York Central Railroad station, where they connected to trains to [[New York City]], [[Chicago]] and points between.

The bright orange FJ&amp;G interurbans were scheduled to meet every daylight New York Central train that stopped at Schenectady. Through the 1900s and into the early 1930s, the line was quite prosperous. In 1932 the FJ&amp;G purchased five lightweight Bullet cars (#125 through 129) from the [[J. G. Brill Company]]. These interurbans represented [[state of the art]] design: the &quot;bullet&quot; description referred to the unusual front roof that was designed to slope down to the windshield in an aerodynamically sleek way. FJ&amp;G bought the cars believing that there would be continuing strong passenger business from a prosperous glove and leather industry, as well as legacy tourism traffic to Lake Sacandaga north of Gloversville.  Instead, roads were improved, automobiles became cheaper and were purchased more widely, tourists traveled more widely, and the [[Great Depression]] decreased business.

FJ&amp;G ridership continued to decline, and in 1938 New York state condemned the line's bridge over the Mohawk River at Schenectady. This bridge had once carried cars, pedestrians, plus the interurban, but ice flow damage in 1928 prompted the state to restrict its use to the interurban.  When in 1938 the state condemned the bridge for interurban use, the line abandoned passenger service. The desirable Bullet cars were sold. Freight business had also been important to the FJ&amp;G, and it continued over the risky bridge into Schenectady a few more years.

'''Newburgh''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|juː|b|ər|g}} is a [[Administrative divisions of New York#City|city]] located in [[Orange County, New York|Orange County]], [[New York]], [[United States]], {{convert|60|mi|km}} north of [[New York City]], and {{convert|90|mi|km}} south of [[Albany, New York|Albany]], on the [[Hudson River]]. Newburgh is a principal city of the [[Poughkeepsie–Newburgh–Middletown metropolitan area]], which includes all of [[Dutchess County, New York|Dutchess]] and Orange counties. The Newburgh area was first settled in the early 18th century by the Germans and British. During the [[American Revolution]], Newburgh served as the headquarters of the [[Continental Army]]. Prior to its chartering in 1865, the city of Newburgh was part of the [[Newburgh (town), New York|town of Newburgh]]; the town now borders the city to the north and west. East of the city is the [[Hudson River]]; the city of [[Beacon, New York]] is east of the river, and is connected to Newburgh via the [[Newburgh–Beacon Bridge]]. The entire southern boundary of the city is with the [[New Windsor, New York|town of New Windsor]]. Most of this boundary is formed by [[Quassaick Creek]].

=== Exploration and settlement ===
The area that became Newburgh was first explored by Europeans when [[Henry Hudson]] stopped by during his 1609 expedition up the river that now bears his name. His navigator [[Robert Juet]] is told to have called the site &quot;a pleasant place to build a town,&quot; although some later historians believe he may actually have been referring to the area where [[Cornwall-on-Hudson, New York|Cornwall-on-Hudson]] now stands.

The first settlement was made a century later, in 1709 by [[Germany|German]] [[Lutheran]]s from the [[Rhenish Palatinate]], who named it the Palatine Parish by Quassic. By 1750, most of the Germans had been replaced by people of [[English people|English]] and [[Scottish people|Scottish]] descent, who in 1752 changed the name to the Parish of Newburgh (presumably after one of the [[Newburgh (disambiguation)#Scotland|Newburgh]]s in [[Scotland]]).
[[File:Washington's Headquarters, Newburgh.jpg|left|thumb|[[Washington's Headquarters State Historic Site|Washington's Headquarters]], preserved as a historic site]]

=== The American Revolution ===
Newburgh was the headquarters of the [[Continental Army]] from March, 1782 until the latter part of 1783. While the army was camped at Newburgh, some of its senior officers began the &quot;[[Newburgh conspiracy]]&quot; to overthrow the government. General [[George Washington]] was able to persuade his officers to stay loyal to him. The army was disbanded here in 1783. Washington received the famous [[Newburgh letter]] from [[Lewis Nicola]] proposing that he become [[monarch|king]] here. It drew a vigorous rebuke from Washington.  In honor of his refusal of that suggestion, Kings Highway, the north-south street behind the Newburgh headquarters, was renamed Liberty Street.

=== Growth of Newburgh in the 19th Century ===
[[File:1842 engraving of Newburgh, NY.jpg|left|thumb|Woodcut of Newburgh skyline from Hudson in 1842, with [[Dutch Reformed Church (Newburgh, New York)|Dutch Reformed Church]], then with its original dome and lantern, prominent.]]
Newburgh was incorporated as a village in 1800 and chartered as a city in 1865. At the time of its settlement it was in [[Ulster County, New York|Ulster County]] and was that county's seat. When [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]] was split from Orange County in 1798, Newburgh and the other towns north of [[Moodna Creek]] were put in a redrawn Orange County. Newburgh thus lost its status as the county seat to [[Goshen (village), New York|Goshen]]. The former Ulster County courthouse still stands as Newburgh's old city courthouse building (currently used as municipal office space).

Newburgh became quite prosperous during the [[Gilded Age]] that followed.  In 1883, the [[West Shore Railroad]] inaugurated service to the [[Exchange Place (PRR station)|Pennyslvania Railroad Depot]] at [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation   | title = Opening the West Shore    | newspaper = The New York Times   | date = June 5, 1883   | url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=FB0B12F93F5511738DDDAC0894DE405B8384F0D3   | accessdate = 2012-01-28   | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by 1886 was traveling to [[Weehawken Terminal]], where passengers transferred to ferries to [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Berliner |first1=Harvey L. |last2=Campo |first2=David W. |last3=Dickerson |first3=Charles N. |last4=Mack |first4=Glenn |year=2003 |month=November |title=Design and Construction of the Weehawken Tunnel and Bergenline Avenue Station for the Hudson–Bergen Light Rail Transit System |journal=Transportation Research E-Circular |volume=E-C058 |publisher=Transportation Research Board |pages=389–406 |issn=0097-8515 |url=http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/circulars/ec058/10_CIVIL%20DESIGN.pdf |accessdate=2011-07-30 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; With its situation on the Hudson River, midway between New York City and Albany, it became a transportation hub and an industrial center. Its industries included manufacturings of cottons, woolens, silks, paper, felt hats, baking powder, soap, paper boxes, brick, plush goods, steam boilers, tools, automobiles, coin silver, bleach, candles, waterway gates, ice machines, pumps, moving-picture screens, overalls, perfumes, furniture, carpets, carburetors, spiral springs, spiral pipe, shirt waists, shirts, felt goods, lawn mowers; shipyards; foundries and machine shops; tanneries; leatherette works; plaster works.

J.J.Nutt made this comment about Newburgh: &quot;The year 1891 finds us the most thriving city on the Hudson, with citizens full of spirit of public enterprise, with public institutions comparatively unequalled, and with apparently every factor and requisite to ensure its bright future as a manufacturing and commercial city of importance. . .&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newburghrevealed.org/history.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Development of modern Newburgh ===
It has been a city with many distinctions. It is home to the first Edison power plant and thus was the first American city to be electrified.&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=dVQmOXQBZeIC&amp;pg=PA34&amp;dq=edison+electric+generating+newburgh&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=edison%20electric%20generating%20newburgh&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; In 1915 it became one of the first American cities to delegate routine governmental authority to a [[Council-manager government|city manager]]. Broadway, which at {{convert|132|ft|m}} in width is one of the widest streets in the State of New York [http://www.newburghhistoricalsociety.com/heartofcity.html], runs through the city culminating with views of the majestic Hudson River.  Newburgh was one of the first cities in the country to fluoridate its water [http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm4841a1.htm].

Newburgh played a pivotal role in television history. In October, 1939, [[RCA]] chose to test-market televisions in Newburgh, which was within range of the television signal of RCA's experimental station [[W2XBS]]. 600 sets were sold in Newburgh at a deep discount. The test-marketing campaign's success encouraged RCA to go forward with developing the new medium. Additionally, with consumer television production ceasing during [[World War II]], those Newburgh households which purchased televisions during 1939 and 1940 were among the few to enjoy television (albeit with a greatly reduced programming schedule) during the war.&lt;ref&gt;von Schilling, James, ''The Magic Window: American Television, 1939-1953'' New York: Haworth Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Newburgh in the 20th Century ===
Newburgh was hit hard economically by several factors in late 20th century and the subsequent decline was precipitous.   The industrial base of the city declined as industries relocated operations south or to other locations with cheaper labor costs and lower taxes.   The Hudson River, which previously served as the main means of transporting goods, lost much of its shipping traffic to trucking.  The city's trolley system was shut down in 1924 in favor of buses.[http://www.thelakeviewhouse.com/Trolley%20cars%20maintain%20their%20place%20in%20history.htm] The nation moved to the automobile for transportation and, as with many other cities, there was a resulting migration to the suburbs. In 1963 the [[Newburgh–Beacon Bridge]] was opened, carrying [[Interstate 84 (east)|Interstate 84]] and spanning the Hudson River, bypassing the Newburgh waterfront and the City of Newburgh altogether. The ferry closed down soon thereafter − it was not [[Newburgh–Beacon Ferry|revived]] until 2005 − and the waterfront area declined rapidly. In 1962, Lloyd's Department Store became the first major shopping center in the Town of Newburgh.  Its motto was &quot;Years Ahead&quot; and the motto proved prophetic.  Many features of Lloyd's, including widely divergent ministores under one roof, did not become common in other shopping centers for many decades. Lloyd's successfully drew a great deal of retail business away from the downtown area. In 1964, the Mid Valley Mall opened, also outside of the city limits in the Town of Newburgh, and attracted many long-established local businesses away from the waterfront and downtown City of Newburgh. Other retail shopping malls soon sprang up, all also outside the City of Newburgh, and the retail portion of the City was doomed. The city continued to lose its previously well regarded retail sector along Water Street and Broadway to the suburban shopping malls, which did not share the City's congested parking and traffic problems — or the perceived rising crime rate.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the city's response to the economic decline was an ambitious [[urban renewal]] plan. The city's historic waterfront area, an area composed of several square blocks which included numerous historically significant buildings, was completely [[demolition|demolished]] between 1970 and 1973. Residents were relocated, or were supposed to be relocated, to newer [[housing project]]s around Muchattoes Lake in the city's interior.

A grand complex that was planned for the [[urban renewal]] area was never built when state and federal spending began to dry up after the [[1973 oil crisis]].  To this day, the blocks which slope down to the river remain open, grassy slopes, offering sweeping views of the Hudson but generating no [[property tax]]es for the city. Public sentiment is mixed on whether they should be built on again at all, and the city's view-protection ordinances make it less likely. Below, the waterfront was developed in the late 1990s after the city was once again able to secure grants from the state's Environmental Protection fund for [[riprap]] (a type of stone) to stabilize the shoreline.

In the early 1960s, city manager Joseph McDowell Mitchell and the council attracted nationwide attention and the admiration of political [[conservatism|conservatives]] when they attempted to require welfare  recipients to pick up their payments at police headquarters. Mitchell later announced a program aimed largely at blacks on welfare, whom many in the community blamed for its economic problems.  The program would have denied welfare payments to all after three months except the aged, the blind and the handicapped.  Those affected would have largely been single mothers of young children, the only category in which blacks were predominant.  The program also would have denied payments to single mothers who had working relatives living in the city. After opposition by both state and federal officials, the program created a national controversy and never went into effect

Along with the failed urban renewal, the mid to late 1960s in Newburgh were also marked by [[race riot]]s and other tensions. The last big one, in 1978, led African-American students at [[Newburgh Free Academy]], the city's public high school, to [[boycott]] classes, and ultimately to a major reorganization of the school system.

These tensions flared up again during the city's hotly contested 1995 mayoral election. Allegations of [[electoral fraud]] had dogged the city's first African-American woman mayor, Audrey Carey, since her 1991 victory in a four-way race. Supporters of Republican candidate Regina Angelo (subsequently a Democrat herself) alleged that many registered voters in neighborhoods Carey had carried heavily used false addresses. In response, four years later deputy [[sheriff]]s were stationed at polling places and challenged voters to provide proof of residency and identity.

Although she won, Carey's supporters claimed that the deputy sheriffs had singled out minority voters for such challenges, and accused the Republicans of [[voter suppression]]. These tensions were only aggravated when the council selected the county's Republican chairman at the time, Harry Porr, as the new city manager. Animosity between Carey and Porr and their respective supporters{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} dominated city politics in the late 1990s.  Carey was defeated by Tyrone Crabb, a black man running on the Republican line, in 1999.  Porr was fired (rehired and fired again in 2001). Crabb died suddenly of a heart attack ten days before he was slated to take office.  The vacancy was filled by his widow, Mary.

Newburgh in the early 21st century is more racially diverse than it used to be, as a growing [[Latin American|Latin]] [[immigration|immigrant]] (mainly of [[Mexican people|Mexican]] descent) population complements the city's sizable [[African American]] contingent. [[Economic development]] is a major concern, but poorly realized, as the good jobs once found in the local manufacturing sector have not been replaced. Pockets of [[poverty]] persist in the city, often mere blocks away from its many historical and architectural [[landmark]]s (some of which are themselves in serious need of repair). In addition to this, the city has been facing issues regarding [[Illegal immigration to the United States|illegal immigration]], like many other cities across the United States, ranging from overcrowded apartment buildings to mild racial conflict.

In spite of the current financial crisis in the US, Newburgh is experiencing a spurt of new businesses on its historic Liberty Street near Washington's Headquarters.  An art supply store, a gourmet food market, an antique store, a used furniture shop, a souvenir shop, a flower shop, a bakery and a restaurant have joined an existing cafe, a graphic design shop and two additional antique stores in the final months of 2008 and January 2009.  This is all in the midst of the redevelopment of East Parmenter Street in a partnership with [[Habitat for Humanity]] and a private developer to build 24 new houses.  The city has completed the overhaul of the infrastructure of the street.

=== Preserving the past ===
Newburgh's preservation history can be traced all the way back to 1850 when [[Washington's Headquarters State Historic Site|Washington's Headquarters]] was designated a state [[historic site]], the first in the country.  Newburgh's Historical Society was founded in 1884.  It purchased the [[David Crawford House]], its museum, in 1958, saving it from being [[demolition|demolished]] to make way for a parking lot for a funeral home.
[[File:Dutch Reformed Church, Newburgh NY.jpg|thumb|right|The Dutch Reformed Church, a National Historic Landmark.]]
The city's modern preservation efforts began when the [[Dutch Reformed Church (Newburgh, New York)|Dutch Reformed Church]], a [[Greek Revival]] structure designed by [[Alexander Jackson Davis]], was slated for demolition as part of [[urban renewal]] after the congregation left the decaying building in 1967. The movement to stop it led to the development of [[Montgomery-Grand-Liberty Streets Historic District|a historic district]], now the second largest in New York State. The church was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] three years later, and in 2001 became the city's second [[National Historic Landmark]] after Washington's Headquarters.

The city was designated a Preserve America community in 2005 and it also signed an agreement with the [[New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation|State Office of Historic Preservation]] as a Certified Local Government community. Its [[East End Historic District (Newburgh, New York)|East End Historic District]], recognized by the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as that and the [[Montgomery-Grand-Liberty Streets Historic District]], has the most [[contributing property|contributing properties]] of any [[historic district]] in the state.

While the city's historic architecture, featuring historic designs by [[Calvert Vaux]], [[Andrew Jackson Downing]] and [[Frederick Law Olmstead]], has attracted a stable core of preservation-minded community activists willing to spend the time and money renovating houses, much work remains to be done. Part of the problem lies in the fact that the city government warehouses a large stock of ''[[Jurisdiction in rem|in rem]]'' properties within its Historic District that have fallen into disrepair as a result of its inability to secure them.
Despite progress from the early 1990s, poverty remains a major (and visible) problem. The [[United States Census, 2000|2000 census]] found that two of the city's five [[census tract]]s are among the poorest in the entire state. In 2004 the state declared it one of the state's five most &quot;stressed&quot; cities, based on a mix of statistics like families headed by single mothers, abandoned buildings, unemployment, residents under the poverty line and adults without a high school diploma. [http://recordonline.com/news/special_reports/newburgh/4.html] Local citizens and city officials blame the county's Department of Social Services for making problems worse by using the city as a dumping ground for its poorest clients. County officials respond that they are only sending people where housing costs are the cheapest.

==Geography==
The city is on the west bank of the [[Hudson River]]. Next to it, the land rises at first sharply to a bluff, where many historic homes are located due to the sweeping views it offers of the [[Hudson Highlands]] to the south, Mount Beacon to the east and the bridge to the north; then more gradually to a relatively level western half. There are some notable hills in outlying areas, such as Overlook Terrace in the city's southeast corner and Mount St. Mary's at the northeast.

The lowest elevation in the city is sea level along the river; the highest is roughly 690 feet (210 m) on Snake Hill along the city's southern boundary with the [[New Windsor, New York|Town of New Windsor]].

Newburgh is located at (41.503193, &amp;minus;74.019636).{{GR|1}}

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|12.4|km2|abbr=on|disp=flip}}. {{convert|9.9|km2|abbr=on|disp=flip}} of it is land and {{convert|2.5|km2|abbr=on|disp=flip}} of it (20.08%) is water.

[[New York State Route 32]] and [[U.S. Route 9W]] pass through the city. [[New York State Route 17K]] and [[New York State Route 207]] also reach their eastern termini within city limits. [[Interstate 84 in New York|Interstate 84]] passes just north of the city and the [[New York State Thruway]] is not far to the west.

==Demographics==
As of the [[census]]{{GR|2}} of 2000, there were 28,259 people, 9,144 households, and 6,080 families residing in the city. The [[population density]] was 7,393.6 inhabitants per square mile (2,856.2/km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). There were 10,476 housing units at an average density of 2,740.9 per square mile (1,058.8/km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). The racial makeup of the city was 42.33% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 32.96% [[African American (U.S. Census)|Black]] or [[Race (United States Census)|African American]], 0.71% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 0.76% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], 0.06% [[Pacific Islander (U.S. Census)|Pacific Islander]], 18.11% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]], and 5.07% from two or more races.

Newburgh has five elected officials,
a [[mayor]] and four [[city council]]members, all elected at-large to four-year terms, staggered so that the mayor and two councilmembers are up for re-election one year and two others two years later. Currently, all four councilmembers are elected [[at-large]], or citywide.  It was anticipated that in November 2007, Newburgh voters would decide on whether to split Newburgh into eight wards and elect one councilmember from each ward.  The City Council voted to disallow this referendum from appearing on the ballot pending further public input. [http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070620/NEWS/706200336/-1/NEWS]

The mayor accepts all legal process and often serves as the symbolic head of the city, but other than that has no special powers or role. The city manager, who appoints all other city officials subject to council approval, serves at their pleasure.

City managers are frequently hired amidst high hopes, yet minimal criteria, and mutual resolve to do better; then [[termination of employment|fired]] a few years later, almost ritually and sometimes spectacularly. Since the position was created in 1916, there have been 33 managers who have served an average tenure of 2.7 years, with John Fogarty holding the longevity record at eight years in the 1950s. His term ended with his dismissal, as did eight others.&lt;ref name=&quot;THR Ketcham firing story, with source&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Wells|first=Kristina|title=City Council fires Ketcham|url=http://archive.recordonline.com/archive/2003/11/25/kwmeet25.htm|publisher=[[Ottaway Community Newspapers]]|newspaper=[[Times-Herald Record]]|date=November 25, 2003|accessdate=March 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2009, Jean Anne McGrane, the first woman to hold the position, was fired for, among other issues, withholding an unfavorable federal report on the city's mishandling of two [[Department of Housing and Urban Development|HUD]] grants&lt;ref name=&quot;McGrane firing&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=James|first=Alexa|title=Newburgh city manager fired|url=http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090113/NEWS/901130338/-1/NEWS14|publisher=[[Ottaway Community Newspapers]]|work=[[Times-Herald Record]]|date=January 13, 2009|accessdate=January 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the City Council in the midst of the consideration of a $6 million bond, the 2009 city budget and the 2009 CDBG funds.

The city has had five mayors and seven managers (five if two who served twice are counted only once) since 2000. Two subsequent acting city managers, after McGrane, quit. Richard Herbek, the third acting manager, took the job months later. He resigned in 2013 amid reports that he had misrepresented an encounter with a prostitute the year before. The police chief, Michael Ferrara, has replaced him on an interim basis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Status of city manager as of May 2013&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Murphy|first=Doyle|title=ewburgh city manager quits amid prostitution scandal|url=http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20130531/NEWS/305310367/-1/NEWS|publisher=[[News Corporation]]|work=[[Times-Herald Record]]|date=May 31, 2013|accessdate=May 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recurring complaint has been that, rather than taking direction from council, some city managers have exploited divisions among members to turn it into a [[Rubber stamp (politics)|rubber stamp]] for their policies and actions and render themselves unaccountable. There have been proposals to change the situation by assigning council members towards or eliminating the city manager's position. But they have been perceived as politically motivated, and thus have not been adopted.

Despite demographics and urban trends favoring [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], the voters of the city had until recent years regularly voted across party lines. Nicholas Valentine, Mayor from 2003 until 2011 and several other recent mayors and councilmembers were Republicans.  The late [[Thomas Kirwan]]- Republican, a resident who served in the [[New York State Assembly]] until 2008—and was re-elected in a successful comeback bid in 2010, by one of the smallest margins in state history (15 votes). He died late in 2011. On March 20, a Special Election was held to fill the vacancy in which former Assemblyman [[Frank Skartados]] - Democrat, won by a large margin. In the general election held in November 2011, a newcomer to the city named Judith Kennedy was overwhelmingly elected Mayor over incumbent Republican Councilwoman Christine Bello. In addition, the Democratic candidates for Council seats, Gay Lee and Cedric Brown, were also overwhelmingly elected.  Accordingly the Council is now 5-0 Democrat—the first time in memory one party monopolizes the City government.

An independent documentary was made in 2004 about the mayoral race in Newburgh, called ''[[Saving Newburgh]]''.

In 2009, the Republican party did not field its own candidates for City Council.  Instead, the Republican Committee endorsed two Democrats --- one a former Councilman, the other an incumbent Councilwoman --- and they were not opposed for the Republican nomination in the primary despite their being registered Democrats.  The Conservative and Independence Parties both nominated them also. They lost the Democratic primary and despite their appearing on three party lines they lost the November election to two straight Democrats, both one time Republicans.&lt;ref&gt;Certified election returns available from the Orange County Board of Elections.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fire department==

The City of Newburgh is protected by the firefighters of the City of Newburgh Fire Department which has 55 members and operates out of two city-wide firehouses. The department runs a frontline apparatus fleet of four engine companies (including two reserve engines), two ladder companies (including one reserve ladder), one fire boat, one fire alarm truck, and seven support units.

===Fire department history===

Newburgh's Fire Department is one of the oldest chartered departments in New York State being established by an act of the young state legislature on March 24, 1797. The earliest Newburgh fire companies were the Protection Engine Company, Cataract Engine Co., Washington Engine Co., and Empire Hook &amp; Ladder. More appeared as neighborhoods expanded. The department purchased its first steam engine in 1872. In its inaugural test, the engine threw a stream of water over the top of the cross of St. Patrick's Church, 161 feet high, to the delight of the citizens watching. The first firefighter to die in the line of duty, Joseph Tillotson, burned to death in a fire at The Bleachery on Lake Street in 1887. In March 1889, the city purchased and installed a modern electric telegraph fire alarm system with 23 alarm boxes placed around the city, these boxes are still in service today. As horses were phased out of service, Ringgold Hose on Colden Street was the first of Newburgh's companies to get a motorized fire truck in 1907. As early as 1915, editorials were calling for the establishment of a paid fire department to assure the response necessary for a densely populated and heavily commercial and industrial city like Newburgh. Beginning with drivers, tillermen and then officers, paid positions for full-time firemen were gradually created for each company. In 1934, the volunteer companies disbanded, and a professional department was instituted by resolution of the City Council. Protection has a cost. Eight men have perished in the line of duty during the department's history: Joseph Tillotson, Willis Meginn, James Hunter, Moses Embler, Armand Santacroce, Edward Maney, Frederick Carpenter and Patrick Bardin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Newburgh Fire History&quot;&gt;[http://www.cityofnewburgh-ny.gov/fire/hist.htm Link text], City of Newburgh.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Binghamton''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɪ|ŋ|əm|t|ən}} is a [[city (New York)|city]] in and the [[county seat]] of [[Broome County, New York|Broome County]], [[New York]], [[United States]].{{GR|6}}  It lies in the state's [[Southern Tier]] region near the [[Pennsylvania]] border, in a bowl-shaped valley at the confluence of the [[Susquehanna River|Susquehanna]] and [[Chenango River|Chenango]] Rivers.&lt;ref name=&quot;valleygeography&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Geology of South-Central New York|year=1963|publisher=New York State Geological Association|location=New York, NY|pages=97–112|url=http://www.nysga.net/files/32068340.pdf|editor=Donald Coates|accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Binghamton is the principal city and cultural center of the [[Binghamton metropolitan area]] (also known as Greater Binghamton, or historically the Triple Cities), home to a quarter million people.{{GR|8}}  The population of the city itself, according to the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], is 47,376.{{GR|1}}

From the days of the [[rail transport in the United States|railroad]], Binghamton was a transportation crossroads and a manufacturing center, and has been known at different times for the production of cigars, shoes, and computers.&lt;ref name=&quot;bingcityhist&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Location, Geography, Historical Brief|url=http://www.binghamton-ny.gov/location-geography-historical-brief|work=City of Binghamton, New York|accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[IBM]] was founded nearby, and the [[flight simulator]] was invented in the city, leading to a notable concentration of electronics- and defense-oriented firms. This sustained economic prosperity earned Binghamton the moniker of the '''Valley of Opportunity'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;broomehist&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Gerald|title=Partners All: A History of Broome County, New York|year=2006|publisher=The Donning Company|location=Virginia Beach, VA|isbn=978-1-578-64339-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, following cuts made by defense firms after the end of the [[Cold War]], the region has lost a significant portion of its manufacturing industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;pewcenter&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Don't Stop There! Five Adventures in Civic Journalism|url=http://www.pewcenter.org/doingcj/pubs/stop/future.html|work=Pew Center for Civic Journalism|accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, while there is a continued concentration of high-tech firms, Binghamton is emerging as a healthcare- and education-focused city, with the presence of [[Binghamton University]] acting as much of the driving force behind this revitalization.&lt;ref name=&quot;jobshift&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Harris|first=Jon|title=Southern Tier jobs shift from manufacturing to service industry|url=http://www.pressconnects.com/article/20130619/BUSINESS/306200007/0/news01/Southern-Tier-jobs-shift-from-manufacturing-to-service-industry|accessdate=31 August 2013|newspaper=Press &amp; Sun-Bulletin|date=19 June 2013|location=Binghamton, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Early settlement===
The first known people of European descent to come to the area were the troops of the [[Sullivan Expedition]] in 1779, during the [[American Revolutionary War]], who destroyed local villages of the [[Onondaga people|Onondaga]] and [[Oneida people|Oneida]] tribes.&lt;ref name=&quot;broomehist&quot; /&gt; The city was named after [[William Bingham]], a wealthy Philadelphian who bought the 10,000 acre [[patent]] for the land in 1786, then consisting of portions of the towns of [[Union, New York|Union]] and [[Chenango, New York|Chenango]].&lt;ref name=&quot;broomehist&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Binghamton: Building the Parlor City|url=http://www.wskg.org/episode/binghamton-building-parlor-city|publisher=WSKG|accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Joshua Whitney, Jr., Bingham's land agent, chose land at the junction of the [[Chenango River|Chenango]] and [[Susquehanna River|Susquehanna]] Rivers to develop a settlement, then named '''Chenango Point''', and helped build its roads and erect the first [[Court Street Bridge (Binghamton)|bridge]].&lt;ref name=broomehist /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hinman|first=Marjory|title=Whitney's Town|year=1996|publisher=Broome County Historical Society|location=Binghamton, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Significant agricultural growth led to the incorporation of the [[village (New York)|village]] of Binghamton in 1834.&lt;ref name=&quot;bingcityhist&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=broomehist/&gt;

The [[Chenango Canal]], completed in 1837, connected Binghamton to the [[Erie Canal]], and was the impetus for the initial industrial development of the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McFee|first=Michele|title=Limestone Locks and Overgrowth: The Rise and Descent of the Chenango Canal|year=1993|publisher=Purple Mountain Press|location=Fleischmanns, NY|isbn=978-0-935-79644-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This growth accelerated with the completion of the [[Erie Railroad]] between Binghamton and [[New York City]] in 1849.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Erie History|url=http://www.erierailroad.org/erie-history/|publisher=Erie Railroad Historical Website|accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the [[Delaware, Lackawanna, and Western Railroad]] arriving soon after, the village became an important regional transportation center.&lt;ref name=&quot;broomehist&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DL&amp;W, Erie, and D&amp;H Early Binghamton History|url=http://www.trainweb.org/SVRHS/earlyRR.html|publisher=Susquehanna Valley Railway Historical Society|accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several buildings of importance were built at this time, including the [[New York State Inebriate Asylum]], opened in 1858 as the first center in the United States to treat alcoholism as a disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=1611239784&amp;ResourceType=Building|title=New York State Inebriate Asylum|date=15 September 2007|accessdate=31 August 2013|work=National Historic Landmark summary listing|publisher=National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Valley of Opportunity: Growth as a manufacturing hub===

Binghamton incorporated as a [[city (New York)|city]] in 1867, and due to the presence of several stately homes, was nicknamed the '''Parlor City'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;bingcityhist&quot;/&gt;  In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many immigrants moved to the area, finding an abundance of jobs.  During the 1880s, Binghamton grew to become the second-largest manufacturer of [[cigar]]s in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;broomehist&quot; /&gt;  However, by the early 1920s, the major employer of the region became [[Endicott Johnson Corporation|Endicott Johnson]], a shoe manufacturer whose development of [[welfare capitalism]] resulted in many amenities for local residents.&lt;ref name=&quot;ejhist&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=McGuire|first=Randall|editor-first=Julian|editor-last=Thomas|title=Interpretive Archaeology: A Reader|publisher=Continuum|year=2000|pages=228–245|chapter=Chapter 13: Building Power in the Cultural Landscape of Broome County, New York, 1880-1940|isbn=978-1-441-17929-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An even larger influx of Europeans immigrated to Binghamton, and the working class prosperity resulted in the area being called the Valley of Opportunity.&lt;ref name=&quot;broomehist&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ejhist&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Bird's-eye View, Binghamton, NY.jpg|left|thumb|right|[[Court Street Historic District (Binghamton, New York)|Court Street]], c. 1910]]

In 1913, 31 people perished in the [[1913 Binghamton Factory Fire|Binghamton Clothing Company fire]], which resulted in numerous reforms to the New York fire code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The fire at Binghamton|work =[[New York Times]]|date=24 July 1913|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=F30A1FF83E5B13738DDDAD0A94DF405B838DF1D3|accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Simonson|first=Mark|title=Binghamton fire spurred improved safety laws|work=The Daily Star|location=Oneonta, NY|date=July 19, 2008|url=http://thedailystar.com/columns/x112901097/Binghamton-fire-spurred-improved-safety-laws|accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Major floods in 1935 and 1936 resulted in a number of deaths, and washed out the Ferry Street Bridge (now the Clinton Street Bridge).  The floods were devastating, and resulted in the construction of flood walls along the length of the Susquehanna and Chenango Rivers.&lt;ref name=&quot;broomehist&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coates|first=Donald|title=Geomorphology in legal affairs of the Binghamton, New York, metropolitan area|journal=GSA Special Papers|year=1976|volume=174|pages=111–148|doi=10.1130/SPE174-p111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Second World War]], growth and corporate generosity continued as [[IBM]], which was founded in Greater Binghamton, emerged as a global technology leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=IBM|encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of New York State|editor1-last=Eisenstadt|editor1-first=Peter|editor2-last=Moss|editor2-first=Laura-Eve|publisher=Syracuse University Press|location=Syracuse, NY|isbn=978-0-815-60808-0|year=2005|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=tmHEm5ohoCUC&amp;lpg=PA756&amp;pg=PA756|accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Along with [[Edwin Link]]'s invention of the [[Link Trainer|flight simulator]] in Binghamton, IBM transitioned the region to a [[high-tech]] economy.  Other major manufacturers included [[Ansco]] and [[General Electric]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bingcityhist&quot; /&gt;  Until the [[Cold War]] ended, the area never experienced an economic downfall, due in part to its [[defense contractor|defense-oriented]] industries.&lt;ref name=&quot;broomehist&quot; /&gt;  The population of the city of Binghamton peaked at around 85,000 in the mid-1950s.&lt;ref name=&quot;bingtimeline&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=A Brief History of Binghamton, NY, The Parlor City|year=1984|publisher=Binghamton Public Library|location=Binghamton, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decline and recovery===
[[File:20 Hawley Street, Binghamton, NY.jpg|left|thumb|20 Hawley Street (designed by [[Charles Luckman]]), built during urban renewal]]
[[File:BinghamtonTSLee2011.jpg|right|thumb|Flooding in 2011 due to the remnants of [[Tropical Storm Lee (2011)|Tropical Storm Lee]]]]

Post-war [[suburb]]an development led to a decline in the city population, as the towns of [[Vestal, New York|Vestal]] and [[Union, New York|Union]] experienced rapid growth.&lt;ref name=&quot;broomehist&quot; /&gt;  As seen in many other [[Rust Belt]] cities, traditional manufacturers saw steep declines, though Binghamton's technology industry limited this impact.  In an effort to reverse these trends, [[urban renewal]] dominated much of the construction during the 1960s and early 1970s, with many ornate city buildings torn down during this period.&lt;ref name=&quot;broomehist&quot; /&gt;  The construction included the creation of [[Government Plaza, Binghamton|Government Plaza]], the [[Broome County Veterans Memorial Arena]], and [[New York State Route 363|North Shore Dr. (NY 363)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Heavey|first=James|title=$80,000,000 Public-Private Outlay Urged to Rebuild Mid-City Area|url=http://fultonhistory.com/Newspaper4/Binghamton%20NY%20Press%20Grayscale/Binghamton%20NY%20Press%20Grayscale%201961/Binghamton%20NY%20Press%20Grayscale%201961%20-%204061.pdf|accessdate=31 August 2013|newspaper=The Evening Press|location=Binghamton, NY|date=22 March 1961}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Five-Stage Plan Is Urged to Cushion Impact|url=http://fultonhistory.com/Newspaper4/Binghamton%20NY%20Press%20Grayscale/Binghamton%20NY%20Press%20Grayscale%201963/Binghamton%20NY%20Press%20Grayscale%201963%20-%200580.pdf|accessdate=31 August 2013|newspaper=The Sunday Press|location=Binghamton, NY|date=13 January 1963}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fitchette|first=Woody|title=City Gets $6,363,571 Project 1 Renewal Aid|url=http://fultonhistory.com/Newspaper4/Binghamton%20NY%20Press%20Grayscale/Binghamton%20NY%20Press%20Grayscale%201968/Binghamton%20NY%20Press%20Grayscale%201968%20a%20-%205447.pdf|accessdate=31 August 2013|newspaper=The Binghamton Press|date=13 November 1968|location=Binghamton, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As was typical of urban renewal, these projects ultimately failed to stem most of the losses, though they did establish Binghamton as the government and cultural center of the region.&lt;ref name=&quot;broomehist&quot; /&gt;

As the Cold War came to a close in 1991 with the collapse of the Soviet Union, the defense-related industries in Greater Binghamton began to falter, resulting in several closures and widespread layoffs&lt;ref name=&quot;bingcityhist2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.binghamton-ny.gov/history|work=City of Binghamton, New York|accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These were most notable at IBM, which sold its [[IBM Federal Systems|Federal Systems]] division and laid off several thousands of workers.&lt;ref name=&quot;pewcenter&quot; /&gt;  The local economy went into a deep recession, and the long-prevalent manufacturing jobs dropped by 64% from 1990 to 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Platsky|first=Jeff|title=Binghamton region gains 100 jobs, but manufacturing at all-time low|url=http://www.pressconnects.com/article/20130307/BUSINESS/303070048/Binghamton-region-gains-100-jobs-manufacturing-all-time-low|accessdate=31 August 2013|newspaper=Press &amp; Sun-Bulletin|location=Binghamton, NY|date=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Binghamton shootings|April 3, 2009 shootings]], which left 14 dead, took place at the [[American Civic Association (Binghamton)|American Civic Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Esposito|first1=Richard|last2=Thomas|first2=Pierre|last3=Goldman|first3=Russell|last4=Potter|first4=Ned|last5=Michels|first5=Scott|title=Binghamton Rampage Leaves 14 Dead, Police Don't Know Motive|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=7249853|accessdate=31 August 2013|newspaper=Nightline|agency=ABC News|date=3 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 21st century, the city has attempted to diversify its economic base in order to spur revitalization.  The local economy has slowly transitioned towards a focus on services and healthcare.&lt;ref name=&quot;jobshift&quot; /&gt;  Major emphasis has been placed on [[Binghamton University]], which built a downtown campus in 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Campus Facilities|url=http://www.binghamton.edu/visiting-campus/campus-facilities.html|publisher=Binghamton University}}&lt;/ref&gt; and several student housing complexes have been created downtown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Binghamton &amp; Regional Economy|url=http://www.binghamton-ny.gov/binghamton-regional-economy|publisher=City of Binghamton, New York|accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Further student housing projects are planned, and the increased downtown residential population has spurred development of supporting businesses, along with a renewed focus on the riverfront.&lt;ref name=&quot;downtownrevival&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Robinson|first=David|title=A year of revival for downtown Binghamton|url=http://www.pressconnects.com/article/20121227/NEWS01/312270049/0/news01/Binghamton-had-a-significant-year-in-terms-of-turnaround-|accessdate=31 August 2013|newspaper=Press &amp; Sun-Bulletin|date=27 December 2013|location=Binghamton, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unfortunately, the recovery has been stymied by two severe floods.  While the majority of the impact of the [[Mid-Atlantic United States flood of 2006]] was in the surrounding metropolitan area, the remnants of [[Tropical Storm Lee (2011)|Tropical Storm Lee]] topped city flood walls in September 2011, causing $1 billion of damage in Greater Binghamton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Masters|first=Jeff|title=Tropical Storm Lee's flood in Binghamton: was global warming the final straw?|url=http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/tropical-storm-lees-flood-in-binghamton-was-global-warming-the-final|work=Dr. Jeff Masters' WunderBlog|publisher=Weather Underground|accessdate=31 August 2013|date=14 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==

===Cityscape===
[[File:Confluence Park.jpg|right|thumb|225px|Confluence Park, facing west towards the confluence of the [[Susquehanna River|Susquehanna]] (left) and [[Chenango River|Chenango]] (right) rivers]]

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|11.14|sqmi|km2}}. {{convert|10.49|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and {{convert|0.65|sqmi|km2}} of it (5.83%) is water.{{GR|8}}

Binghamton is located at the confluence of two rivers, in the middle of a long but relatively narrow valley.&lt;ref name=&quot;valleygeography&quot;/&gt;  The north branch of the [[Susquehanna River]] passes through downtown. This branch rises in eastern New York and receives a number of tributaries above Binghamton.  In the center of the city, the [[Chenango River|Chenango]] River feeds into the Susquehanna from the north. As a result, eleven bridges span the rivers inside city limits.  Major floods have occurred in 1865, 1935, 1936, [[Mid-Atlantic United States flood of 2006|2006]], and [[Tropical Storm Lee (2011)|2011]].&lt;ref name=&quot;broomehist&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top Ten Highest Historical Crests: Susquehanna River at Binghamton|url=http://www.erh.noaa.gov/marfc/Rivers/FloodClimo/Top_Flood_Crests/Nbs/Binghamton-NBS-Top10-Table.pdf|work=North Branch Susquehanna River Basins|publisher=National Weather Service, Mid Atlantic River Forecast Center|accessdate=1 September 2013|date=31 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Flooding|url=http://www.srbc.net/flood_forecasting/history_of_flooding.htm|work=Flood Forecast &amp; Warning in the Susquehanna River Basin|publisher=Susquehanna River Basin Commission|accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Downtown Binghamton at Night.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Downtown at night]]
The incorporation of Binghamton united various communities located on both shores of the two rivers. The majority of the city's population and development lies along the rolling terrain nearest the riverbanks with sparse development in the hills that define the city limits.  The old city was laid out on a grid system by Joshua Whitney, Jr.,&lt;ref name=&quot;broomehist&quot; /&gt; but as development spread to the outer regions of the city and merged with other settlements, several grids were eventually juxtaposed against each other.  In the Southside, the grid breaks down, as more curvilinear roads make up the predominantly residential areas along the hills.

Along the railroad corridors, a number of factories, mostly abandoned, rise above the otherwise-uniform landscape.

[[New York State Route 17C|Main Street]] runs through the West Side, and continues west to serve as Main Street in the villages of [[Johnson City, New York|Johnson City]] and [[Endicott, New York|Endicott]].  On the east side of the Chenango River, the road becomes [[U.S. Route 11 in New York|Court Street]], the major east-west artery in downtown and the East Side.

Binghamton has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Dfb''), with cold, snowy winters and warm, wet summers.&lt;ref name=&quot;koppen&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Kottek|first=Marcus|last2=Greiser|first2=Jürgen|last3=Beck|first3=Christoph|last4=Rudolf|first4=Bruno|last5=Rubel|first5=Franz|display-authors=2|title=World Map of Köppen−Geiger Climate Classification|date=June 2006|journal=Meteorologische Zeitschrift|volume=15|issue=3|page=261|doi=10.1127/0941-2948/2006/0130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Summers in Binghamton are typified by warm yet temperate days, and there are an average of only 2.6 days annually where the high exceeds {{convert|90|°F|0}}, with the highest recorded temperature at {{convert|98|°F|0}} on July 16, 1988.  Winters are somewhat less moderate, with 5.8 days with sub-{{convert|0|°F|0}} lows annually on average; the lowest temperature ever recorded was {{convert|−20|°F|0}} on January 15, 1957.&lt;ref name=&quot;NOAA&quot;/&gt;  As with most cities in upstate New York, precipitation in Binghamton is spread evenly throughout the year, and as such there is no dry season.&lt;ref name=&quot;koppen&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NOAA&quot;/&gt;

Snowfall is significant, with an annual total of {{convert|84.4|in|cm|0}}.

As of the [[census]]{{GR|8}} of [[2010 United States Census|2010]], there were 47,376 people, 21,150 households, and 9,986 families residing in the city.  The [[population density]] was 4,516.8 per square mile (1,743.9/km²).  There were 23,842 housing units at an average density of 2,273.1 per square mile (877.6/km²).  Of all households, 20.8% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 26.9% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 15.6% had a female householder with no husband present, 4.7% had a male householder with no wife present, and 52.8% were non-families. 40.5% of all households were made up of individuals and 25.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.  The average household size was 2.18 and the average family size was 2.94.

Binghamton is home to a large ethnic population.  During its industrial heyday, thousands of European immigrants moved to the city as they found an abundance of jobs and working-class prosperity.  A large number of Italians, Irish, and Eastern Europeans settled in the area, and the [[American Civic Association (Binghamton)|American Civic Association]] was created to help their transition to life and [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]] in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;broomehist&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;golddomechurches&quot; /&gt; This inrush led to a temporary rise in the local [[Ku Klux Klan]] during the 1920s, with Binghamton serving as state headquarters.  Area residents, who primarily embraced the different cultural heritages, quelled such anti-immigrant sentiment by founding several ethnic organizations and holding ethnic celebrations, at the encouragement of [[Endicott-Johnson]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ejhist&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ku Klux Klan Reference Deleted from Pamphlet|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/12/nyregion/ku-klux-klan-reference-deleted-from-pamphlet.html|accessdate=11 September 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=12 September 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has had a lasting effect on the city, which sports a large number of churches and contemporary ethnic festivals, along with a population that is still predominantly white (though steadily decreasing in proportion).  As of 2010, the racial makeup of Binghamton was 77.6% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 11.4% [[African American (U.S. Census)|Black]] or [[Race (United States Census)|African American]], 0.3% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 4.2% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], 0.04% [[Pacific Islander (U.S. Census)|Pacific Islander]], 2.0% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]], and 4.4% from two or more races.  6.4% of the population were [[Hispanics in the United States|Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]] of any race.

Due to its ethnic diversity, there are a large number of religious affiliations within the region.  The First Ward was historically home to much of the Eastern European population, and houses several gold dome Orthodox churches.&lt;ref name=&quot;golddomechurches&quot; /&gt;  As a result of its strong Italian and Irish heritage, the largest religious body in Broome County is the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;religiondata&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Broome County|url=http://www.thearda.com/rcms2010/r/c/36/rcms2010_36007_county_name_2010.asp|work=County Membership Report|publisher=Association of Religion Data Archives|accessdate=11 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Binghamton falls under the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Syracuse]].

The median age was 33.2 years. For every 100 females, there were 96.1 males.  For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 87.8 males.

The [[Binghamton metropolitan area]] is home to 251,725 people. The [[metropolitan statistical area|MSA]] is composed of all of [[Broome County, New York|Broome County]] and neighboring [[Tioga County, New York|Tioga County]].

The median income for a household in the city was $30,267, and the median income for a family was $40,012. Males had a median full-time income of $39,137 versus $32,712 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the city was $20,951. About 21.4% of families and 30.0% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 41.9% of those under age 18 and 13.0% of those age 65 or over.

The area is home to the [[Eastern League (U.S. baseball)|Eastern League]]'s [[Binghamton Mets]] (AA affiliate of the [[New York Mets]]). The B-Mets have sent stars like [[José Reyes (shortstop)|José Reyes]], [[David Wright (baseball)|David Wright]], [[Preston Wilson]], [[Ike Davis]], [[Zack Wheeler]], [[Edgardo Alfonzo]], [[Jon Niese]], and [[Jay Payton]] to the majors.

Binghamton has a long history in professional Organized Baseball dating back to 1877. Teams nicknamed the Crickets, the Bingoes, and for many years the Triplets represented Binghamton in the New York State League (now defunct), the New York-Pennsylvania League, the International League and the Eastern League (1892–94, 1938–1963, 1967–1968, 1992–present).

The 1887 Binghamton Bingoes of the International League attracted national attention for employing 2 black players, an outstanding infielder named Frank Grant and a pitcher whose name has only come down through history as &quot;Renfroe&quot;. The reaction around the league forced Binghamton to release the players, and the team itself folded shortly thereafter.

The Binghamton Triplets of the Eastern League became a farm club of the New York Yankees in the 1940s and sent many players to New York up to 1968, most notably the Hall of Fame pitcher Whitey Ford, who starred for Binghamton in 1949.

The best player in the history of Binghamton was the pitcher William &quot;Wild Bill&quot; Hallahan. Born in Binghamton in 1902, he debuted in the major leagues with the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] in 1925 and had a 12 year career. (He was known as &quot;Wild Bill&quot; because of the many batters he walked, leading the league in that category twice). Hallahan led the Cardinals to the World Series title in 1931 over the [[Detroit Tigers]] with two complete game victories in which he only allowed a total of one run. When his career was over, he worked as a supervisor at Ansco for many years and passed away in Binghamton in 1981.

Professional hockey arrived in Binghamton in 1973 with the founding of the Broome Dusters of the North American Hockey League. The Dusters were popular from the start with a wide open style of play which was unusual in professional hockey at the time. When the league folded in 1977, the Providence team of the American Hockey League moved to Binghamton and became the Binghamton Dusters. The team became the Binghamton Whalers from 1980 to 1990 and the Binghamton Rangers from 1990 to 1997 as a result of affiliations with the [[NHL]] [[Hartford Whalers]] and [[New York Rangers]]. The team is now the [[Binghamton Senators]] who currently serve as the [[American Hockey League|AHL]] affiliate of the [[Ottawa Senators]]. The B-Sens won division titles on 2003 and 2005, reaching the AHL conference finals in 2003 and winning the [[Calder Cup]] in 2011. They play their home games at [[Broome County Veterans Memorial Arena]].  The B-Sens have sent stars like [[Jason Spezza]], [[Robin Lehner]], [[Chris Kelly (ice hockey)|Chris Kelly]], [[Jakob Silfverberg]] and [[Jean-Gabriel Pageau]] to the NHL.

[[Binghamton University]] plays Division I college sports as a member of the [[America East Conference]]. Division III College Sports are played at [[Broome Community College]]. Bobby Gonzalez, former head coach of Seton Hall's men's basketball team was born here, and still has family in the area. King Rice, head basketball coach at [[Monmouth University]], attended Binghamton High School.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gomuhawks.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=62258&amp;SPID=6806&amp;DB_LANG=C&amp;DB_OEM_ID=14300&amp;ATCLID=205125543&amp;Q_SEASON=2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Binghamton is also home to two semi-pro football teams, the Broome County Dragons (members of the [[Empire Football League]]) and the Southern Tier Green Machine (members of the [[North American Football League]]).  In addition, two women's football teams call Binghamton home; the [[Binghamton Tiger Cats]] (members of the [[Independent Women's Football League]]) and the [[Southern Tier Spitfire]] (members of the [[Women's Football Alliance]]). Of the 4 teams only the Binghamton Tiger Cats still survive for 2012.

The area is also home to an annual Professional Tennis Challenger, the Levene Gouldin &amp; Thompson Tennis Challenger, part of the [[USTA]] pro circuit (Known as the [[Frito-Lay]] Tennis Challenger in years past). Tennis greats such as [[Lleyton Hewitt]], [[James Blake (tennis)|James Blake]] and more recently [[Andy Murray]] found their start with this tournament, using it as a spring board to the [[U.S. Open (tennis)]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://biz.stny.com/tennischallenger/history.asp]{{Dead link|date=June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[B.C. Open]] was an official [[PGA Tour]] event that was held annually from 1971 to 2005 at  Endicott's En-Joie Golf Course. (Note that the 2006 B.C. Open had to be played in Verona, N.Y. due to extensive damage during the June 2006 Flooding of the Susquehanna River.) Beginning in 2007, the area hosted a PGA Champion's Tour event, the [[Dick's Sporting Goods Open]]. The event replaced the [[B.C. Open]] and continues to be played at En-Joie Golf Course in Endicott.

Since 1978 a round of the [[American Motorcyclist Association]]'s [[Motocross]] Championship has been held at the nearby Broome-Tioga Sports Center.  This round of the series has recently been moved to Texas and is no longer hosted by the Broome-Tioga Sports Center.  They also host the New York State Motocross Championships each fall and many other semi-pro events throughout the season.

Two world famous amateur sports tournaments are held in Binghamton. The Stop DWI Holiday Classic – a nationally recognized high school basketball tournament – calls the city home during the Christmas season, amassing about 16 of the nations best teams from places such as Orlando, NYC, Philadelphia, Kentucky, Cincinnati, and other large metropolitan areas. The World Youth Classic is an American Legion youth baseball tournament featuring world-class Legion baseball teams. Held in July, it features teams from Florida, Kentucky, Ohio, New York, Georgia, and New England. As many as 32 teams may play per year.

==Parks and recreation==

{{Expand section|date=August 2013}}

Binghamton is known for its bicycling and walking clubs, facilities, and trails. The Binghamton River Trail is an urban trail starting at Confluence Park, where the rivers intersect, and traveling alongside the Chenango River, past the Martin Luther King, Jr. Promenade and Noyes Island, up to Cheri A. Lindsey Park in the North Side.  In 2007, Binghamton was named the ninth-greenest city in the U.S. by ''[[Country Home (magazine)|Country Home]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bestplaces.net/docs/studies/greencities.aspx Best Green Cities]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government==
[[File:Gov't Plaza.jpg|thumb|right|Government Plaza]]
Since its incorporation as a city in 1867, Binghamton has been a municipality with a &quot;strong&quot; [[Mayor-council government|mayor-council]] form of government. The city government, originally housed in the old Municipal Building on Collier Street (now the Grand Royale Hotel), is now based at the Binghamton City Hall which occupies the west-wing of [[Government Plaza, Binghamton|Government Plaza]] on the corner of State and Hawley streets. The mayor and councilors are elected to four-year terms and are limited to serving only two. The Binghamton City Council is a unicameral body consisting of seven Council members whose districts are defined by geographic population boundaries.

===Neighborhood Assemblies Program===
The Binghamton Neighborhood Assemblies Program created nine public forum assemblies in which city residents play a lead role in &quot;restoring the pride&quot; in Binghamton by sharing their concerns, hopes and needs and then working in conjunction with city government and community partners to implement positive change.

Though a promising idea, multiple factors, including lack of interest caused most meetings to die out after mid-2006 though some held out longer.  Currently, meetings do not take place and the main page on the cities website concerning neighborhood assemblies has been removed.

===Safety===
Public safety in Binghamton is the primary responsibility of the 124-officer [[Binghamton Police Department]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityofbinghamton.com/department.asp?zone=dept-police Police]&lt;/ref&gt; and the 132-officer [[Binghamton Fire Department]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityofbinghamton.com/department.asp?zone=dept-fire Fire Department]&lt;/ref&gt; The Binghamton Fire Department is composed of 134 paid uniformed firefighters, EMTs and paramedics.

===Binghamton Human Rights Law and Commission===
In 2008, the City of Binghamton enacted Local Law 08-1, the Binghamton Human Rights Law, which expands protections offered at the state and federal government to include prohibitions against discrimination based on gender identity or expression, height and weight in employment, housing, education and public accommodation. In 2011, under the authority of N.Y. General Municipal Law 239-O and by City of Binghamton Local Law 11-3, the City of Binghamton established the Binghamton Human Rights Commission whose mission is to condemn discrimination in all its forms, to educate the public, and to work to eliminate discrimination against people based on age, race, color, creed, religion, national origin, ancestry, disability, marital status, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, weight or height, veteran status, or criminal conviction.  Intake forms for claims of discrimination can be found at the Commission's website: www.binghamtonhrc.org.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.binghamtonhrc.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cityofbinghamton.com/department.asp?zone=dept-city-clerk&amp;pid=155&amp;pm=page&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ProspectMountainProject.jpg|right|thumb|New bridges under construction at the Interstate 81 and NY 17 (future Interstate 86) junction in the North Side]]
Binghamton is a major junction in the [[Interstate Highway System]], much as it was during the days of the railroad.  [[Interstate 81]], a major north-south route, connects the city to Syracuse and [[Ontario]], as well as to [[Pennsylvania]] and [[Appalachia]].  Binghamton also serves as the western terminus of [[Interstate 88 (New York)|Interstate 88]], which gives a direct route to [[Albany, New York|Albany]].

The 2010 census placed the city total population at 15,541.{{GR|2}} Beacon is part of the [[Poughkeepsie (city), New York|Poughkeepsie]]&amp;ndash;[[Newburgh (city), New York|Newburgh]]&amp;ndash;[[Middletown, Orange County, New York|Middletown, New York]] [[Poughkeepsie-Newburgh-Middletown metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]] as well as the larger [[New York City|New York]]&amp;ndash;[[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]]&amp;ndash;[[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], New York–[[New Jersey]]–[[Connecticut]]–[[Pennsylvania]] [[New York metropolitan area|Combined Statistical Area]]. It was named to commemorate the historic beacon fires that blazed forth from the summit of the Fishkill Mountains to alert the [[Continental Army]] about British troop movements.

The area occupied as Beacon was originally settled as the villages of '''Matteawan''' and '''Fishkill Landing''' in 1709, which were among the first communities in the county. Beacon is located in the southwest corner of Dutchess County in the [[Mid-Hudson Region]], approximately {{convert|90|mi|km}} south of [[Albany, New York]], and approximately {{convert|65|mi|km}} north of New York City. 

== History ==
In 1683, the land that would come to include the City of Beacon was purchased from the [[Wappinger]] Indians by [[Francis Rombouts|Francis Rombout]] and Gulian Verplanck, merchant-fur traders from New York City. The sale was confirmed, in 1685 by royal patent issued in the names of Rombout, Jacobus Kipp (as successor to the deceased Verplanck, and [[Stephanus Van Cortlandt]]. Rombout died in 1691, leaving his share to his daughter, [[Madam Brett Homestead|Catharyna]], who later married Roger Brett, an officer in the Royal Navy. The Rombout Patent was partitioned in 1706 with Catharyna Brett receiving about 28,000 acres along the [[Fishkill Creek|Vis Kill]]. In 1708 the Bretts re-located upriver from the family home on Broadway to an area near the mouth of the Fishkill Creek and built a grist mill on the lower creek. In June 1718, Roger Brett was drowned when his sloop encountered a fierce squall near Fishkill Landing while returning from New York with supplies. Thereafter Catharyna Brett continued to manage her holdings, becoming a well-respected businesswoman.

===Fishkill Landing===
Unlike the Verplancks, Livingstons, and other landowners, Madam Brett was not averse to selling land to settlers, although often retaining the right to build a mill. Of paramount importance was the commerce in flour. During the first third of the nineteenth century, Dutchess County ranked first among New York State counties in wheat production, supplying one third of all the flour produced in the State.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archive.org/stream/dutchesscounty00federich/dutchesscounty00federich_djvu.txt WPA Federal Writers Project, American Guide Series: Dutchess County, Philadelphia, William Penn Associates of Philadelphia, 1937]&lt;/ref&gt;  Madam Brett laid out a free road over her property from the river eastward to the limits of her lands.&lt;ref name=verplanck/&gt; “Madam Brett’s Road” (now, route 52) ran from Fishkill Landing through Matteawan to Fishkill.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aauwpoughkeepsie.org/uploads/PDFs/notable_women/catharyna%20brett.pdf Notable Women]&lt;/ref&gt; The mill thrived, attracting farmers from both sides of the river. Wheat and corn were ground into flour and meal, and shipped to New York. In 1748, Madam Brett, with eighteen others, entered into an agreement for the building of the Frankfort Store House. which stood near the water at the &quot;Lower Landing&quot; north of Dennings Point. This was the origin of river freighting.&lt;ref name=verplanck&gt;[http://archive.org/stream/cu31924028853327#page/298/mode/2up Verplanck, William E., &quot;The Town of Fishkill&quot; in Hasbrouck's ''History of Dutchess County]&lt;/ref&gt; Fishkill Landing developed into a river port. As early as 1780 two dozen vessels operated out of Fishkill Landing.
  
[[File:Bogardus-DeWindt House.jpg|thumb|left|Bogardus-DeWindt House]]
The early development of Fishkill Landing was due in no small part to the enterprises of John Peter DeWint. [http://archive.org/stream/cu31924028853327#page/300/mode/2up] DeWint was born in Tappan in 1787. His father was a Dutchman who came to New York form the West Indies. The DeWint house in Tappan was one of George Washington's headquarters during the Revolution. In September 11, 1814 John Peter DeWint married Caroline Smith, granddaughter of John Adams. DeWint owned 2,000 acres at Fishkill Landing, a gift from his father; and held property and business interests across the river in Newburgh. In 1815 he built the Long Dock. He had a shipyard on the river just south of the Long Dock, and interests in the freight business which for many years was conducted by sloops for the Long Dock as well as the Lower and Upper Landings. In 1828 Cornelius Carman of Low Point, (present day [[Chelsea, Dutchess County, New York|Chelsea]]), built for DeWint and Carpenter, the ''Plow Boy'', the first steam-powered ferry between Fishkill Landing and Newburgh.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chelseayacht.org/history/carthage.htm Carthage Landing]&lt;/ref&gt; The Fishkill Landing post office was established in 1804.&lt;ref name=verplanck/&gt; DeWint purchased the [[Bogardus-DeWindt House]] and lands as part of his Cedar Grove estate. His mother, Elizabeth, moved there in 1825. DeWint's original homestead was located on the river just north of Fishkill Landing, but was destroyed by fire in 1862. He donated land for the Dutch parsonage and burial grounds. John Peter DeWint died on November 18, 1870.&lt;ref name=verplanck/&gt;

Between the voyages of the ''Half Moon'' and the ''Clermont'' there were two centuries when sloops conducted much of the river traffic. The sloop is of Dutch origin. In its simplest form, it is a vessel of one mast, carrying a mainsail, jib, and generally a topsail. For steering, a long tiller was used. Sloops were a favorite means of travel, and for the shipping of light articles, parcels, and letters. Frequently, better time was made the sloop than by the stagecoach. The ''Caroline'', built by John Peter DeWint and named in honor of his daughter, once made the sixty miles from New York to Fishkill Landing in five hours.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/william-edward-verplanck/the-sloops-of-the-hudson-an-historical-sketch-of-the-packet-and-market-sloops-o-pre/1-the-sloops-of-the-hudson-an-historical-sketch-of-the-packet-and-market-sloops-o-pre.shtml Verplanck, Wm. E. and Collyer, Moses W., ''The Sloops of the Hudson'', G.P.Putnam's Sons, New York, 1908]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Matteawan===
[[File:Madam_brett_homestead_beacon_2006.jpg|thumb|Madam Brett Homestead]]
Matteawan was situated on the [[Fishkill Creek]] about a mile and a half east of Fishkill Landing, and a like distance above the mouth of the creek, whose hydraulic properties contributed to its development as a manufacturing center. It lay at the foot of the Fishkill Mountains, and was a station on both the [[Newburgh, Dutchess and Connecticut Railroad|Newburgh, Dutchess &amp; Connecticut]], and the New York &amp; New England Railroads, and was connected with the Fishkill Landing by stage, and rail. The first settlers were Roger and Catharyna Brett, who in 1709 built a home further upstream from their original location.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usgennet.org/usa/ny/county/dutchess/dutch/Hist/mttwn1.htm Smith, James H., &quot;Matteawan&quot; in ''History of Dutchess County'', Chapter XLIV, 1882]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Newburgh-Beacon ferry===
Ferry service between the future locations of both cities had existed in some form at least since 1743. By the early 20th century the fleet had grown to three 160-foot (49 m) coal-fired ferries, the Orange, Dutchess and Beacon, capable of carrying 30 vehicles each. It linked the two segments of NY 52, the major east-west artery at that point. Increasing traffic on 52 by midcentury, however, coupled with the building of the New York State Thruway in the Hudson corridor, was straining the ferry beyond its breaking point. The state's Department of Public Works began planning for a bridge, but it was not a serious possibility until federal money became available through the construction of Interstate 84. Beacon is serviced weekdays by a commuter ferry, [[Newburgh-Beacon Ferry|The Newburgh-Beacon Ferry]], over the Hudson between both cities which helps alleviate traffic to the Beacon Train Station from Orange County commuters. The ferry's route runs between Beacon City Harbor and Newburgh City Waterfront.

==Historic neighborhoods==
===Byrnsville=== 
Byrnsville, or Tioronda, was a hamlet near the mouth of the Fishkill, about a mile south of Fish- 
kill Landing, and contained the Tioronda Hat Works. In 1880 it had a population of two hundred and seventeen. The Hat 
Works occupied the site of an old cotton-mill at this place which failed before 1850. A grist and saw-mill were subsequently built on the site but torn down by Lewis Tompkins in 1878 when the Hat Works were erected. A little below these works 
is the former site of the Madam Brett grist-mill, for which this has been mistaken.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt;

===Groveville===
Groveville derives its name from the extensive oak grove which formerly occupied the site. There was a grist mill at Groveville from a very early day, owned about 1820 by Samuel Upton, a Quaker. who acquired it from Abraham Dubois. Upton also erected on the opposite side of the race a stone building which he used as a fulling mill. Sometime after 1840, the property, was sold it to the Glenham Co., who converted it to a woolen mill, and did carding,spinning and weaving.&lt;ref name=smith&gt;[http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/james-h-james-hadden-smith/history-of-duchess-county-new-york--with-illustrations-and-biographical-sketch-272/page-107-history-of-duchess-county-new-york--with-illustrations-and-biographical-sketch-272.shtml Smith, James Hadden, ''History of Dutchess County with Illustrations and Biographical Sketch'',Syracuse, D. Mason &amp; Co., 1882]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lower Main Street Historic District 2012-09-28 11-16-17.jpg|thumb|Lower Main Street Historic District]]
===Lower Main Street Historic District=== 
The first several blocks of Main Street east of its junction with South Avenue constitutes the [[Lower Main Street Historic District]] and features many small businesses located in vintage [[Italianate architecture|Italianate]]-[[architectural style|style]] buildings.

Beacon [[Municipal corporation|incorporated]] as a city in 1913, amalgamating the two [[Administrative divisions of New York#Village|villages]] as well as a small portion of the [[Administrative divisions of New York#Hamlet|hamlet]] of Glenham from the [[Administrative divisions of New York#Town|town]] of [[Fishkill (town), New York|Fishkill]].

The city served a variety of roles during the Revolutionary War. It manufactured war supplies, and served as a fort and signaling point. The city's name came from signal fires that were atop nearby Beacon Mountain. During the 1800s, the city became a factory town and was known as &quot;The Hat Making Capital of the US&quot; with nearly 500 hat factories operating at one time.{{Citation needed|reason=500 hat factories in a town that today has less than 15000 people is highly unlikely and may be a reference to Danbury which at one time hat over 50 operational hat factories|date=October 2010}} 

During the 1960s, urban renewal led to the destruction of some significant historic buildings. In the late 1970s, the Dutchess Ski area, which had been a large tourist attraction, was closed. Also in the 1970s, a decline in the economy shuttered most of the factories. This decline quickly became a severe and ongoing economic downturn that lasted from about 1970 to the late 1990s, during which almost 80 percent of the city's commercial business spaces and factories were vacant.

Starting in the late 1990s, with the opening of one of the world's largest contemporary art museums [[Dia: Beacon]], Beacon began an artistic and commercial rebirth. New development continues to enlarge the city. Currently, the two largest planned projects are a waterfront hotel and conference center, and &quot;The Rivers and Estuaries Center&quot; on Dennings Point.

Beacon is home to one of at least three operating &quot;[[Traffic light#Dummy lights|dummy-lights]]&quot; in the United States, located at the intersection of Main and East Main Streets. It is a [[traffic light|traffic signal]] on a pedestal which sits in the middle of an intersection, dating back to the 1920s. The other two are also located in New York, in [[Canajoharie (village), New York|Canajoharie]] and [[Croton-on-Hudson, New York|Croton-on-Hudson]].

Beginning on February 24, 2010, a massive snowstorm affected the city and surroundings. On February 25 Mayor Steve Gold enacted a [[State Of Emergency]], due to total snow accumulations in excess of three feet. The city was without [[electricity]] and [[gas]] services for over two days.

==Historic Places==
'''[[Madam Brett Homestead]]''', 50 Van Nydeck Avenue — the oldest building in Dutchess County, and is on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name=guide&gt;&quot;Guide to Museums, Historical Organizations, Local Historians, Libraries / Dutchess - Orange - Putnam - Rockland - Ulster - Westchester - Bronx&quot;, published by the Lower Hudson Conference in Elmsford, N.Y., second edition, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bogardus-DeWindt House''' is located on Tompkins Avenue, a short distance west of NY 9D, in Beacon, New York, United States. It typifies the houses built in the region between 1750 and 1830. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on April 19, 1993.

[[File:Beacon Dutch Reformed Church.jpg|thumb|left|Beacon Dutch Reformed Church]]
'''[[Reformed Church of Beacon]]''', originally the Reformed Dutch Church of Fishkill Landing, is a congregation of the Reformed Church in America.  The oldest church in Beacon, the congregation was established in 1813. It overlooks the Hudson River from the top of a bluff. The church and its cemetery were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.

'''[[Eustatia]]''' is a brick cottage in the Victorian Gothic style overlooking the Hudson River on Monell Place. It was built in 1867 to designs by Frederick Clarke Withers for his friend John Monell. Monell had recently married Caroline DeWindt Downing, widow of the influential Newburgh architect Andrew Jackson Downing, with whom Withers had worked. They built the house on property deeded to them by her father, John DeWindt. Its original form and appearance have remained largely intact since its construction. In 1979 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places.

The '''[[Howland Cultural Center]]''', also known as Howland Library, is the former public library building, located on Main Street. It was designed in 1872 by Richard Morris Hunt, brother-in-law of Joseph Howland. He was one of a committee of ten local benefactors who had joined to establish a library for their city, and commissioned Hunt for the job. When the library opened, its 2,200-volume collection was available only to subscribers. Later the library opened to the general public, but by 1976 the collection needed more space and so the library moved down Main Street. The old library building is now in the hands of a private non-profit organization, the Howland Cultural Center, which presents art exhibitions and other cultural activities. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 5, 1973.

==The Mount Beacon Incline Railway==
From 1902 to 1978, the [[Mount Beacon Incline Railway]] was one of the steepest incline railways in existence (a 74% grade).

'''Port Jervis''' is a [[Administrative divisions of New York#City|city]] on the [[Delaware River]] in western [[Orange County, New York|Orange County]], [[New York]], with a population of 8,828 at the 2010 census. The communities of [[Deerpark]], Huguenot, Sparrowbush, and Greenville are adjacent to Port Jervis, and the towns of [[Montague, New Jersey]] and [[Matamoras, Pennsylvania]] face the city across the respective state borders. From late spring to early fall many thousands of travelers and tourists pass through Port Jervis on their way to enjoying rafting, kayaking, canoeing and other activities in the [[Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area]] and the [[Upper Delaware Scenic and Recreational River]] and the surrounding area.

Port Jervis is part of the [[Poughkeepsie (city), New York|Poughkeepsie]]&amp;ndash;[[Newburgh (city), New York|Newburgh]]&amp;ndash;[[Middletown, Orange County, New York|Middletown]], NY [[Poughkeepsie-Newburgh-Middletown metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]] as well as the larger [[New York City|New York]]&amp;ndash;[[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]]&amp;ndash;[[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], NY-[[New Jersey|NJ]]-[[Connecticut|CT]]-[[Pennsylvania|PA]] [[New York metropolitan area|Combined Statistical Area]].

In August 2008, Port Jervis was named one of &quot;Ten Coolest Small Towns&quot; by ''Budget Travel'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Karen Tina. [http://www.budgettravel.com/bt-dyn/content/article/2008/08/02/AR2008080201203.html &quot;10 Coolest Small Towns: Port Jervis&quot;]. ''Budget Travel''. (September 2008). Retrieved January 13, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography and transportation==
Port Jervis is located on the north bank of the [[Delaware River]] at the point where: 1) the [[Neversink River]] &amp;ndash; the Delaware's largest [[tributary]] &amp;ndash; empties into the larger river; and 2) the Delaware makes a right turn to run south-southwest along Kittatinny Ridge [[Kittatinny Mountains]] &amp;ndash; until reaching the [[Delaware Water Gap]].  A left turn through the Delaware Water Gap takes the Delaware River to continue on to [[Trenton, New Jersey]], [[Philadelphia]] and [[Delaware Bay]]. Port Jervis is connected by the [[Mid-Delaware Bridge]] across the Delaware to [[Matamoras, Pennsylvania]].

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{Convert|2.7|mi2|km2}}, of which, {{Convert|2.5|mi2|km2}} is land and {{Convert|0.2|mi2|km2}} (6.64%) is water.

[[U.S. Route 6 in New York|US 6]], [[U.S. Route 209 in New York|US 209]], [[New York State Route 42|NY 42]], and [[New York State Route 97|NY 97]] (the &quot;Upper Delaware Scenic Byway&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upperdelawarescenicbyway.org/overview/overview.php &quot;Upper Delaware Scenic Byway website]&lt;/ref&gt;) pass through Port Jervis. [[Interstate 84 in New York|Interstate 84]] passes to the south.

Port Jervis is the [[Port Jervis (Metro-North station)|last stop]] on the {{Convert|95|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} [[Port Jervis Line (Metro-North)|Port Jervis Line]], which is a commuter railroad service from [[Hoboken, New Jersey]] and [[New York City]] that is contracted to [[NJ Transit]] by the [[Metro-North Railroad]] of the [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority (New York)|Metropolitan Transportation Authority]].  The track itself continues on to [[Binghamton, New York|Binghamton]] and [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], but passenger service beyond Port Jervis was discontinued in 1970.

[[Image:NY NJ PA Tripoint.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Tri-State Rock or Monument overlooking the confluence of the Delaware and Neversink Rivers]]

===State line monuments===
Port Jervis lies near the points where the states of [[New York]], [[New Jersey]] and [[Pennsylvania]] come together. South of the Laurel Grove Cemetery, under the viaduct for Interstate 84, are two monuments marking the boundaries between the three states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.njgeology.org/enviroed/newsletter/v2n2.pdf |title= Sentinels at the Northern Border |first=Bill |last=Graff |format= pdf|work= Unearthing New Jersey Vol. 2, No. 2 | date=Summer 2006 |publisher=New Jersey Geological Survey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The larger monument is a granite pillar inscribed &quot;Witness Monument&quot; and dated 1882. It is not on any boundary itself, but instead is a witness for two boundary points. On the north side (New York), it references the corner boundary point between New York and Pennsylvania that is located in the center of the Delaware River {{Convert|475|ft|m}} due west of the Tri-State Rock. On the south side (New Jersey), it references the Tri-State Rock {{Convert|27.5|ft|m}} to the south.

The smaller monument, Tri-State Rock, marks both the northwest end of the New Jersey and New York boundary and the north end of the New Jersey and Pennsylvania boundary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.state.nj.us/dep/njgs/enviroed/oldpubs/SG-FINAL-REPORT-VOL-I.PDF|title=Physical Description of New Jersey|first=C. Clarkson|last=Vermeule|publisher=Geological Survey of New Jersey|location=Trenton, New Jersey|work=Final Report of the State Geologist. Vol. I. Topography. Magnetism. Climate|year=1888|pages=66–7|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a small granite block with inscribed lines marking the boundaries of the three states and a bronze [[U. S. National Geodetic Survey|National Geodetic Survey]] marker at the triple point, where you can stand in three states at once. It also marks the northernmost point of New Jersey. The current Tri-State Monument is a replacement for the original monument erected in 1774, which was important in resolving the [[New York - New Jersey Line War]].

The first fully developed European settlement in the area was established c.1690, and a land grant of {{Convert|1200|acre|ha}} was formalized on October 14, 1697. The settlement was originally known as Mahackamack, which was its name when it was raided and burned in the [[American Revolutionary War]] by British forces under the command of [[Joseph Brant]] before the [[Battle of Minisink]] in 1779. Over the next two decades, the settlement was rebuilt and more roadways were developed to better connect Mahackamack with the eastern parts of Orange County.

After the [[Delaware and Hudson Railway#Delaware and Hudson Canal|Delaware and Hudson Canal]] was opened in 1828, providing transportation of coal from northeastern Pennsylvania to New York and New England via the [[Hudson River]], trade brought money and further development to the area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://minisink.org/delhud.html &quot;D&amp;H Canal &amp; Gravity Railroad&quot;], Minisink Valley Historical Society&lt;/ref&gt; A village was incorporated in 1853, and was renamed Port Jervis in the mid-19th century, after [[John B. Jervis|John Bloomfield Jervis]], the D&amp;H Canal's chief engineer. Port Jervis grew steadily into the 1900s, and on July 26, 1907, it became a city.

[[File:Erie Depot Port Jervis entrance.jpg|thumb|left|350px|The [[Erie Depot]], built in 1892, was the largest station on the [[Erie Railroad]]'s Delaware Division.  The Erie ceased long distance passenger service in 1970.  The depot was recently restored.]]

===Coming of the railroad===
The first rail line to run through Port Jervis was the [[New York &amp; Erie Railroad]], which in 1832 was chartered to run from [[Piermont, New York]], on the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]], to [[Lake Erie]].  Ground was broken in 1835, but construction was delayed by a [[Panic of 1837|nationwide financial panic]], and did not start again until 1838.  The line was completed in 1851, and the first passenger train &amp;ndash; with [[Millard Fillmore|President Millard Fillmore]] and [[United States Senator]] from New York [[Daniel Webster]] on board &amp;ndash; came through the city on May 14.  The railroad went through a number of name changes, becoming the [[Erie Railroad]] in 1897.&lt;ref name=rr&gt;[http://www.minisink.org/rrpjhis.html &quot;Railroads of Port Jervis&quot;]. Minisink Valley Historical Society website&lt;/ref&gt;

A second railroad, the Port Jervis and Monticello Railroad, later leased to the [[New York, Ontario and Western Railway]] (O&amp;W), opened in 1868, running north out of the city, and eventually connecting to [[Kingston, New York]], [[Weehawken, New Jersey]] and western connections.&lt;ref name=rr /&gt;

Like the D&amp;H Canal, the railroads brought new prosperity to Port Jervis in the form of increased trade and investment in the community from the outside. However, the competition that the railroad brought also hastened the decline of the canal, which ceased operation in 1898, and the railroads were the basis of the city's economy for the coming decades.  Port Jervis became Erie's  division center between [[Jersey City, New Jersey]] and [[Susquehanna, Pennsylvania]], and by 1922, twenty passenger trains went through the city every day, and over 2,500 Erie employees made their homes there.&lt;ref name=age /&gt;

Unfortunately, the railroads themselves began to decline after the [[Great Depression]],&lt;ref name=age&gt;[http://www.minisink.org/histpj.html &quot;Port Jervis and the Gilded Age&quot;], Minisink Valley Historical Society&lt;/ref&gt; accelerating after [[World War II]] with the building of the [[Interstate Highway System]] and increased competition from trucking companies.  One of the first [[Class I railroad]] to shut down was the O&amp;W, in 1957, leaving Port Jervis totally reliant on the Erie.  Only a few years later, in 1960, the Erie, also on a shaky financial footing, merged with [[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad]] to become the [[Erie-Lackawanna]].  In 1976, along with a number of other struggling railroads, such as the [[Penn Central Railroad|Penn Central]], the Erie-Lackawana became part of [[Conrail]].&lt;ref name=rr /&gt;  With the breakup of Conrail, the trackage around Port Jervis is controlled by [[Norfolk Southern]].

The decline of the railroads was an economic blow to Port Jervis, one it is still, as of 2011, recovering from.

On June 2, 1892, Robert Lewis, an African American, was lynched on Main Street in Port Jervis after being accused of participation in an assault on a white woman.&lt;ref name=&quot;“Lynching at Port Jervis. – Robert Jackson, a colored man, hanged by a mob&quot;  &gt;{{cite web |url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=F60710FC3E5C17738DDDAA0894DE405B8285F0D3|title=title= Lynched at Port Jervis. – Robert Jackson, a colored man, hanged by a mob |title= Lynching at Port Jervis. – Robert Jackson, a colored man, hanged by a mob |publisher=''[[New York Times]]''|date=June 3, 1892 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A grand jury indicted nine people in connection with the lynching.&lt;ref name=&quot;Port Jervis Lynching indictments&quot;  &gt;{{cite web |url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=F30E12F63E5C17738DDDA90B94DE405B8285F0D3|title=Port Jervis Lynching indictments |publisher=New York Times|date=June 30, 1892 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This event would serve as inspiration for one-time Port Jervis resident and author [[Stephen Crane]]'s 1898 novella ''[[The Monster (novella)|The Monster]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Wertheim, Stanley.

==Recent history==
Being situated at the confluence of the Delaware and Neversink Rivers has sometimes led to flooding problems. In one such instance associated with [[Hurricane Diane]] in 1955 a flood-related rumor started a panic that was later studied in a 1958 report issued by the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] called &quot;The Effects of a Threatening Rumor on a Disaster-Stricken Community&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://orsted.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=9552&amp;page=1 &quot;The Effects of a Threatening Rumor on a Disaster-Stricken Community &quot;]. National Research Council (NRC). (1958) Retrieved January 13, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to having flooded during periods of heavy rainfall, at times ice jams have effectively dammed the Delaware, and in 1875 floes destroyed the existing bridge to Matamoras.&lt;ref name=age /&gt; In 1981 when a large ice floe resulted in the highest water crest measured to date at the [[National Weather Service]]'s Matamoras [[river gage]] {{Convert|26.6|ft|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;Weyandt, Kimberly. [http://www.riverreporter.com/issues/04-09-30/news-floodhistory.html &quot;Flooding is old news&quot;]. ''The River Reporter'' (September 30 - October 6, 2004). Retrieved March 5, 2011.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the NWS' list of [http://water.weather.gov/ahps2/crests.php?wfo=bgm&amp;gage=mtmp1 &quot;Historical Crests&quot;] for the river at Matamoras/Port Jervis shows a peak of {{Convert|25.5|ft|m}} in 1904, and no record peak in 1981 at all.&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 14, 2007, a large parade was held in Port Jervis to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the city's founding. Fire departments and marching bands from the surrounding area marched in the parade. The Fireman's Day Parade, one of the city's longest and most popularly celebrated traditions, is an annual event held every second Saturday in the month of July.

In 2011 [http://www.pjsoapboxderby.com The Port Jervis Soap Box Derby] officially became the largest local soap box derby in the world.

==History==
{{Main|History of New York City}}

===Early history===
In the [[Pre-Columbian era|precolonial era]], the area of present day New York City was inhabited by various bands of [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] tribes of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], including the [[Lenape]], whose homeland, known as [[Lenapehoking]], included Staten Island, the western portion of [[Long Island]] (including the area that would become Brooklyn and Queens), Manhattan, and the [[Lower Hudson Valley]], including The Bronx.&lt;ref&gt;Evan T. Pritchard: Native New Yorkers: the legacy of the Algonquin people of New York, p.27 (2002); ISBN 1-57178-107-2&lt;/ref&gt;

The first documented visit by a European was in 1524 by [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]], a [[Florence|Florentine]] explorer in the service of the [[French crown]], who sailed his ship ''[[La Dauphine]]'' into [[New York Harbor]]. He claimed the area for France and named it &quot;Nouvelle Angoulême&quot; ([[New Angoulême]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;rodgers&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=New York: The World's Capital City, Its Development and Contributions to Progress |author=Rankin, Rebecca B., Cleveland Rodgers |publisher=Harper |year=1948}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The Purchase of Manhattan Island.png|thumb|[[Peter Minuit]] is credited with the purchase of the island of Manhattan in 1626.|alt=A pen drawing of two men in 16th-century Dutch clothing presenting an open box of items to a group of Native Americans in feather headdresses stereotypical of plains tribes.]]

A [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] expedition led by captain [[Estêvão Gomes]], a [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] sailing for [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]], arrived in [[New York Harbor]] in January of 1525 aboard the purposely-built caravel &quot;La Anunciada&quot; and charted the mouth of the Hudson river, which he named ''Rio de San Antonio''. Heavy ice kept him from further exploration, and he returned to [[Spain]] in August. The first scientific map to show the North American East coast continuously, the 1527 world map known as the [[Padrón Real]], was informed by Gomes' expedition, and labeled the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] as ''Tierra de Esteban Gómez'' in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;Wpa Writer's Project:A Maritime History of New York, p.246;Going Coastal Productions (2004) ISBN 0-9729803-1-8&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1609, [[English people|English]] explorer [[Henry Hudson]] re-discovered the region when he sailed his ship the ''[[Halve Maen]]'' (&quot;Half Moon&quot; in Dutch) into New York Harbor while searching for the [[Northwest Passage]] to the [[Orient]] for his employer the [[Dutch East India Company]]. He proceeded to sail up what he named the ''[[Hudson River|North River]],'' also called the ''Mauritis River'', and now known as the [[Hudson River]], to the site of the present-day New York State capital of [[Albany, New York|Albany]] in the belief that it might represent an oceanic [[tributary]]. When the river narrowed and was no longer [[saline water|saline]], he realized it wasn't a sea passage and sailed back downriver. He made a ten-day exploration of the area and claimed the region for his employer. In 1614 the area between [[Cape Cod]] and [[Delaware Bay]] would be claimed by the [[Netherlands]] and called ''Nieuw-Nederland'' ([[New Netherland]]).

The first recorded non-[[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] inhabitant of what would eventually become New York City was [[Dominican people|Dominican]] trader [[Juan (Jan) Rodriguez|Juan Rodriguez]] (transliterated to Dutch as Jan Rodrigues). Born in [[Santo Domingo]] of [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] and [[African people|African]] descent, he arrived in [[Manhattan]] during the winter of 1613–1614, trapping for pelts and trading with the local population as a representative of the Dutch. [[Broadway (New York City)|Broadway]], from 159th Street to 218th Street, is named Juan Rodriguez Way in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Roberts|first=Sam|title=Honoring a Very Early New Yorker|url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/02/honoring-a-very-early-new-yorker/?_r=0|newspaper=New York Times|date=October 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccny.cuny.edu/news/juan-rodriguez-monograph.cfm Juan Rodriguez monograph].

New York grew in importance as a trading port while under [[British Empire|British rule]] in the early 1700s. It also became a center of [[slavery]], with 42% of households holding slaves by 1730, more than any other city other than [[Charleston, South Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/hidden-history-slavery-new-york#|title=The Hidden History of Slavery in New York|author=Adele Oltman|publisher=The Nation|date=October 24, 2005|accessdate=2013-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most slaveholders held a few or several domestic slaves, but others hired them out to work at labor.  Slavery became integrally tied to New York's economy through the labor of slaves throughout the port, and the banks and shipping tied to the South. Discovery of the [[African Burying Ground]] in the 1990s during construction of a new federal courthouse near [[Foley Square]] revealed that tens of thousands of Africans had been buried in the area in the colonial years.

The trial in Manhattan of [[John Peter Zenger]] in 1735 helped to establish the [[freedom of the press]] in North America. In 1754, [[Columbia University]] was founded under charter by [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]] as King's College in Lower Manhattan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An Historical Sketch of Columbia College, in the City of New York, 1754–1876 |author=Moore, Nathaniel Fish |year=1876 |page=8 |publisher=Columbia College}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Stamp Act Congress]] met in New York in October 1765 as the [[Sons of Liberty]] organized in the city, skirmishing over the next ten years with British troops stationed there.

Behind them is a mounted soldier with a bayonet and behind them is a large flag.]]
The [[Battle of Long Island]], the largest battle of the [[American Revolutionary War]], was fought in August 1776 entirely within the modern-day borough of Brooklyn. After the battle, in which the Americans were defeated, leaving subsequent smaller [[Engagement (military)|armed engagements]] following in its wake, the city became the British military and political base of operations in North America. The city was a haven for [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] refugees, as well as escaped slaves who joined the British lines for freedom newly promised by the Crown for all fighters. As many as 10,000 escaped slaves crowded into the city during the British occupation. When the British forces [[Evacuation Day (New York)|evacuated]] at the close of the war in 1783 they transported 3,000 [[freedmen]] for resettlement in [[Nova Scotia]]. They resettled other freedmen in England and the [[Caribbean]].

The only attempt at a peaceful solution to the war took place at the [[Conference House]] on Staten Island between American [[delegate]]s including [[Benjamin Franklin]], and British general [[Lord Howe]] on September 11, 1776. Shortly after the British occupation began the [[Great Fire of New York (1776)|Great Fire of New York]] occurred, a large conflagration which destroyed about a quarter of the buildings in the city, including [[Trinity Church (New York City)|Trinity Church]].&lt;ref&gt;Trinity Church bicentennial celebration, May 5, 1897 By Trinity Church (New York, N.Y.) p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1785, the assembly of the [[Congress of the Confederation]] made New York the national capital shortly after the war. New York was the last capital of the U.S. under the [[Articles of Confederation]] and the first capital under the [[United States Constitution|Constitution of the United States]]. In 1789 the first President of the United States, [[George Washington]], was inaugurated; the first [[United States Congress]] and the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] each assembled for the first time, and the [[United States Bill of Rights]] was drafted, all at [[Federal Hall]] on Wall Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The People's Vote: President George Washington's First Inaugural Speech (1789) |publisher=U.S. News and World Report |url=http://www.usnews.com/usnews/documents/docpages/document_page11.htm |accessdate=2008-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1790, New York had surpassed [[Philadelphia]] as the largest city in the United States.

Several prominent American literary figures lived in New York during the 1830s and 1840s, including [[William Cullen Bryant]], [[Washington Irving]], [[Herman Melville]], [[Rufus Wilmot Griswold]], [[John Keese]], [[Nathaniel Parker Willis]], and [[Edgar Allan Poe]]. Public-minded members of the old merchant elite lobbied for the establishment of [[Central Park]], which in 1857 became the first landscaped park in an American city.

The [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Irish Famine]] brought a large influx of [[Irish diaspora|Irish immigrants]], and by 1860, one in four New Yorkers—over 200,000—had been born in [[Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.virtualny.cuny.edu/cholera/1866/cholera_1866_set.html &quot;Cholera in Nineteenth Century New York&quot;].

[[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] candidates were consistently elected to local office, increasing the city's ties to the South and its dominant party. In 1861 Mayor [[Fernando Wood]] called on the aldermen to declare independence from Albany and the United States after the South seceded, but his proposal was not acted on.&lt;ref name=&quot;Divided&quot;/&gt; Anger at new [[military conscription]] laws during the [[American Civil War]] (1861–1865) led to the [[New York Draft Riots|Draft Riots of 1863]], led by ethnic Irish working class.&lt;ref name=&quot;Divided&quot;/&gt;

The situation deteriorated into attacks on black New Yorkers and their property, following fierce competition for a decade between immigrants and blacks for work. Rioters burned the Colored Orphan Asylum to the ground, but its more than 200 children escaped harm.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris&quot;/&gt; Rioters killed an estimated 100 blacks and attacked many more, especially in the docks area. It was one of the worst incidents of civil unrest in American history.&lt;ref&gt;

In 1904, the steamship ''[[PS General Slocum|General Slocum]]'' caught fire in the East River, killing 1,021 people on board.  In 1911, the [[Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire]], the city's worst industrial disaster, took the lives of 146 garment workers and spurred the growth of the [[International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union]] and major improvements in factory safety standards.&lt;ref name=&quot;cornell1&quot;&gt;

By 1916, New York City was home to the largest urban African diaspora in North America. The [[Harlem Renaissance]] of literary and cultural life flourished during the era of [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]].  The larger economic boom generated construction of competing skyscrapers that changed the skyline into its identifiable twentieth-century shape.

Returning [[World War II]] veterans created a postwar economic boom and the development of large [[housing tract]]s in eastern Queens. New York emerged from the war unscathed as the leading city of the world, with Wall Street leading America's place as the world's dominant economic power. The [[United Nations Headquarters]] (completed in 1950) emphasized New York's political influence, and the rise of [[abstract expressionism]] in the city precipitated New York's displacement of [[Paris]] as the center of the art world.&lt;ref&gt;

Important new sectors, such as [[Silicon Alley]], emerged in the city's economy.  New York's population reached all-time highs in the [[United States Census, 2000|2000 Census]] and then again in the 2010 Census.

{{Main|Geography of New York City|Geography of New York Harbor}}
[[File:Aster newyorkcity lrg.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Satellite imagery]] illustrating the core of the [[New York City Metropolitan Area]].]]
New York City is located in the [[Northeastern United States (U.S. Census Bureau)|Northeastern United States]], in southeastern New York State, approximately halfway between [[Washington, D.C.]] and [[Boston]].&lt;ref&gt;Washington, D.C. is {{convert|228|mi|km}} driving distance from New York, and Boston is {{convert|217|mi|km}} driving distance from New York.&amp;nbsp;– [http://maps.google.com/ Google Maps]&lt;/ref&gt; The location at the mouth of the [[Hudson River]], which feeds into a naturally sheltered harbor and then into the [[Atlantic Ocean]], has helped the city grow in significance as a trading [[port]]. Much of New York is built on the three islands of Manhattan, Staten Island, and [[Long Island]], making land scarce and encouraging a high population density.

The Hudson River flows through the [[Hudson Valley]] into [[New York Bay]]. Between New York City and [[Troy, New York]], the river is an [[estuary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://life.bio.sunysb.edu/marinebio/fc.1.estuaries.html |title=Information About the Hudson River Estuary |publisher=Life.bio.sunysb.edu |accessdate=2011-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hudson separates the city from [[New Jersey]]. The [[East River]]—a tidal strait—flows from [[Long Island Sound]] and separates the Bronx and Manhattan from Long Island. The [[Harlem River]], another tidal strait between the East and Hudson Rivers, separates most of Manhattan from the Bronx. The [[Bronx River]], which flows through the Bronx and [[Westchester County]], is the only entirely [[fresh water]] river in the city.&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;

New York City has a high degree of [[income disparity]]. In 2005, the median household income in the wealthiest census tract was $188,697, while in the poorest it was $9,320.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Roberts, Sam |title=In Manhattan, Poor Make 2 Cents for Each Dollar to the Rich |work=The New York Times |date=April 9, 2005 |url=http://www.fiscalpolicy.org/SamRoberts4Sep05.htm |accessdate=2007-03-27}}{{dead link|date=May 2013}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
The disparity is driven by [[real wage|wage growth]] in [[Rate schedule (federal income tax)|high income brackets]], while wages have stagnated for middle and lower income brackets.

The character of New York's large residential districts is often defined by the elegant [[brownstone]] [[Terraced house|rowhouses]], [[townhouse]]s, and shabby [[Apartment|tenements]] that were built during a period of rapid expansion from 1870 to 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=History of Housing in New York City: Dwelling Type and Change in the American Metropolis |author=Plunz, Richard A. |chapter=Chapters 3 [Rich and Poor] &amp; 4 [Beyond the Tenement] |year=1990 |publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=0-231-06297-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, New York City also has neighborhoods that are less densely populated and feature free-standing dwellings.

===Parks===
The City of New York has a complex park system, with various lands operated by the [[National Park Service]], the [[New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation]], and the [[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation]].

In its 2013 ParkScore ranking, [[Trust for Public Land|The Trust for Public Land]] reported that New York City had the 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; best park system among the 50 most populous U.S. cities.&lt;ref&gt;Foderado, Lisa W.

Throughout the boroughs there are [[:Category:Neighborhoods in New York City|hundreds of distinct neighborhoods]], many with a definable history and character to call their own. If the boroughs were each independent cities, four of the boroughs (Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, and The Bronx) would be among the ten most populous cities in the United States.
* '''[[Manhattan]]''' (New York County) is the most densely populated borough and is home to [[Central Park]] and most of the city's skyscrapers. Most of the borough is on Manhattan Island, at the mouth of the [[Hudson River]].  Manhattan is the [[financial center]] of the city and contains the headquarters of many major corporations, the UN, a number of important universities, and many cultural attractions. Manhattan is loosely divided into [[Lower Manhattan|Lower]], [[Midtown Manhattan|Midtown]], and [[Upper Manhattan|Uptown]] regions. Uptown Manhattan is divided by Central Park into the [[Upper East Side]] and the [[Upper West Side]], and above the park is [[Harlem]]. New York City's remaining four boroughs are collectively referred to as the &quot;outer boroughs&quot;.
* '''[[The Bronx]]''' (Bronx County) is New York City's northernmost borough, the location of [[Yankee Stadium]], home of the [[New York Yankees]], and home to the largest [[housing cooperative|cooperatively owned housing]] complex in the United States, [[Co-op City, Bronx|Co-op City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Frazier, Ian |title=Utopia, the Bronx |work=The New Yorker |date=June 26, 2006 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/06/26/060626fa_fact_frazier |accessdate=2008-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Except for a small section of Manhattan known as [[Marble Hill, Manhattan|Marble Hill]], the Bronx is the only section of the city that is part of the United States' [[mainland United States|mainland]]. It is home to the [[Bronx Zoo]], the world's largest metropolitan zoo,&lt;ref name=BronxZoo/&gt; which spans {{convert|265|acre|km2}} and is home to over 6,000 animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=New York City Museum Guide |author=Ward, Candace |publisher=Dover Publications |year=2000 |isbn=0-486-41000-5 |page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bronx is the birthplace of [[Rapping|rap]] and [[hip hop culture]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Toop-RapAttack2&quot;/&gt;
* '''[[Brooklyn]]''' (Kings County) on the western tip of [[Long Island]], is the city's most populous borough and was an independent city until 1898. Brooklyn is known for its cultural, social and ethnic diversity, an independent art scene, [[List of Brooklyn neighborhoods|distinct neighborhoods]] and a distinctive architectural heritage. [[Downtown Brooklyn]] is the only central core neighborhood in the outer boroughs. The borough features a long beachfront shoreline including [[Coney Island]], established in the 1870s as one of the earliest amusement grounds in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Coney Island: The People's Playground |author=Immerso, Michael |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year=2002 |page=3 |isbn=0-8135-3138-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Queens]]''' (Queens County) on Long Island east of Brooklyn, is geographically the largest borough and the most ethnically diverse county in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;queensdiverse&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/04/nyregion/04fourth.html |author=O'Donnell, Michelle |title=In Queens, It's the Glorious 4th, and 6th, and 16th, and 25th&amp;nbsp;... |work=New York Times|date=July 4, 2006 |accessdate=2008-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically a collection of small towns and villages founded by the Dutch, the borough has since developed both commercial and residential prominence. Queens County is the only large county in the United States where the median income among African Americans, approximately $52,000 a year, is higher than that of [[White American]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Black Incomes Surpass Whites in Queens |author=Roberts, Sam |work=The New York Times |date=January 10, 2006 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/01/nyregion/01census.html?ref=nyregion |accessdate=2008-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Queens is the site of [[Citi Field]], the home of the [[New York Mets]], and annually hosts the [[US Open (tennis)|U.S. Open tennis tournament]]. Additionally, it is home to two of the three major airports serving the [[New York metropolitan area]], [[LaGuardia Airport]] and [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]]. (The third is [[Newark Liberty International Airport]] in [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], New Jersey.)
* '''[[Staten Island]]''' (Richmond County) is the most suburban in character of the five boroughs. Staten Island is connected to Brooklyn by the [[Verrazano-Narrows Bridge]] and to Manhattan by way of the free [[Staten Island Ferry]]. The Staten Island Ferry is one of the most popular tourist attractions in New York City as it provides unsurpassed views of the [[Statue of Liberty]], [[Ellis Island]], and lower Manhattan. Located in central Staten Island, the {{convert|2500|acres|km2|abbr=on}} [[Staten Island Greenbelt]] has some {{convert|28|mi|km}} of walking trails and one of the last undisturbed forests in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nynjtc.org/park/staten-island-greenbelt |title=Staten Island Greenbelt &amp;#124; New York-New Jersey Trail Conference |publisher=Nynjtc.org |accessdate=2010-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Designated in 1984 to protect the island's natural lands, the Greenbelt comprises seven city parks.

In 2005, there were more than 100 television shows taped in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=2005 is banner year for production in New York |publisher=The City of New York Mayor's Office of Film, Theater and Broadcasting |date=December 28, 2005 |url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/film/html/news/010106_2005_banner_year.shtml |accessdate=2008-09-01}}{{dead link|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The City of New York operates a public broadcast service, [[NYCTV]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/media/html/home/home.shtml |title=NYC Media |publisher=Nyc.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; that has produced several original Emmy Award-winning shows covering music and culture in city neighborhoods and city government.

New York is also a major center for [[non-commercial educational]] media. The oldest [[public-access television]] channel in the United States is the [[Manhattan Neighborhood Network]], founded in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mnn.org/en/community-celebrates-public-access-tvs-35th-annive |title=Community Celebrates Public Access TV's 35th Anniversary |publisher=Mnn.org |accessdate=2010-10-28}}{{dead link|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[WNET]] is the city's major public television station and a primary source of national [[Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS) television programming.

New York City's food culture includes a variety of world cuisines influenced by the city's immigrant history. [[Eastern Europe]]an and Italian immigrants have made the city famous for [[bagel]]s, [[Cheesecake#North America|cheesecake]] and [[New York-style pizza]], while [[Chinese restaurant|Chinese]] and other Asian restaurants, burger joints, Italian restaurants, diners and coffee shops are ubiquitous. Some 4,000 mobile food vendors licensed by the city, many immigrant-owned, have made [[Middle East]]ern foods such as [[falafel]]s and [[kebab]]s standbys of modern New York [[street food]], although hot dogs and pretzels are still the main street fare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kebabs on the Night Shift |first=Jennifer |last=Bleyer |work=The New York Times |date=May 14, 2006 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/14/nyregion/thecity/14vend.html| accessdate=2008-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city is also home to many of the finest and most diverse [[haute cuisine]] restaurants in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Michelin Takes on the City, Giving Some a Bad Taste |first=Glenn |last=Collins |work=The New York Times |date=November 3, 2005 |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C03E0D9163EF930A35752C1A9639C8B63 |accessdate=2006-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accent===
The New York area has a distinctive regional speech pattern called the [[New York dialect]], alternatively known as ''Brooklynese'' or ''New Yorkese''. It is generally considered one of the most recognizable accents within [[American English]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Newman |first=Michael |year=2005 |chapter=New York Talk |title=American Voices |editor1-first=Walt |editor1-last=Wolfram |editor2-first=Ben |editor2-last=Ward |pages=82–87 |publisher=Blackwell |isbn=1-4051-2109-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The classic version of this dialect is centered on middle and working-class people of [[European American|European]] descent, and the influx of non-European immigrants in recent decades has led to changes in this distinctive dialect.&lt;ref name=NYT19930214/&gt;

The traditional New York area accent is [[rhotic and non-rhotic accents|non-rhotic]], so that the sound {{IPA|[ɹ]}} does not appear at the end of a syllable or immediately before a consonant; hence the pronunciation of the city name as &quot;New Yawk.&quot;&lt;ref name=NYT19930214/&gt; There is no {{IPA|[ɹ]}} in words like ''park'' {{IPA|[pɑək]}} or {{IPA|[pɒək]}} (with vowel backed and [[vowel breaking|diphthongized]] due to the low-back chain shift), ''butter'' {{IPA|[bʌɾə]}}, or ''here'' {{IPA|[hiə]}}. In another feature called the low back chain shift, the {{IPA|[ɔ]}} vowel sound of words like ''talk'', ''law'', ''cross'', ''chocolate'', and ''coffee'' and the often [[homophonous]] {{IPA|[ɔr]}} in ''core'' and ''more'' are tensed and usually raised more than in [[General American]].

In the most old-fashioned and extreme versions of the New York dialect, the vowel sounds of words like &quot;girl&quot; and of words like &quot;oil&quot; become a diphthong {{IPA|[ɜɪ]}}. This is often misperceived by speakers of other accents as a reversal of the ''er'' and ''oy'' sounds, so that ''girl'' is pronounced &quot;goil&quot; and ''oil'' is pronounced &quot;erl&quot;; this leads to the caricature of New Yorkers saying things like &quot;Joizey&quot; (Jersey), &quot;Toidy-Toid Street&quot; (33rd St.) and &quot;terlet&quot; (toilet).&lt;ref name=NYT19930214/&gt; The character [[Archie Bunker]] from the 1970s sitcom ''[[All in the Family]]'' (played by [[Carroll O'Connor]]) was a good example of a speaker with this feature. This speech pattern is no longer prevalent.&lt;ref name=NYT19930214&gt;{{cite news |last=Sontag |first=Deborah |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE0D61438F937A25751C0A965958260 |title=Oy Gevalt!

New York can claim several major sports superlatives in the world of North American professional sports leagues.  In 1928, with the Rangers winning their first [[List of Stanley Cup champions|Stanley Cup]], New York became the first city to win championships in all four major professional sports.  The New York Giants baseball team had won their first World Series in 1905 (and first National League pennant in 1888); the New York Football Giants had won their first NFL title in 1927; and the [[Original Celtics]] won their first [[American Basketball League (1925–55)|American Basketball League]] title in 1927.  In fact, with the Yankees winning the [[1927 World Series|1927]] and [[1928 World Series|1928]] World Series, the city laid claim to all four professional titles at once, a feat never matched in the modern era.  With the Knicks winning the 1970 NBA title, the city laid claim to being the first to have won championships in all four current major leagues, a feat since matched by five other cities (Boston, Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles and Philadelphia).  With the [[New York Cosmos]] winning the 1972 NASL title, New York became the first, and to date only, city to win titles in the five largest professional sports in North America.

New York City is served by [[Amtrak]], which uses [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Pennsylvania Station]]. Amtrak provides connections to [[Boston]], [[Philadelphia]], and [[Washington, D.C.]] along the [[Northeast Corridor]] and long-distance train service to other [[North America]]n cities. The [[Port Authority Bus Terminal]], the main [[intercity bus]] terminal of the city, serves 7,000 buses and 200,000 commuters daily, making it the busiest bus station in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=

The New York City Subway is the largest [[rapid transit]] system in the world when measured by stations in operation, with {{NYCS const|number|total}}, and by length of routes. It is the third-largest when measured by annual ridership (1.5&amp;nbsp;billion passenger trips in 2006).&lt;ref name=MTAinfo /&gt; New York's subway is also notable because nearly the entire system remains open 24 hours a day, in contrast to the overnight shutdown common to systems in most cities, including [[MTR|Hong Kong]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtr.com.hk/eng/getting_around/service_hours.html|title=Service Hours|publisher=MTR|accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.travelchinaguide.com/cityguides/hongkong/transportation/metro-tsuenwan-line.htm|title=Tsuen Wan Line|publisher=TravelChinaGuide.com|accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[London Underground|London]], [[Paris Métro|Paris]], [[Seoul Metropolitan Subway|Seoul]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smrt.co.kr/program/Eng/Subway/Train/Station_select.jsp?main=Y|title=Train Time Table - Search station|publisher=[[Seoul Metropolitan Rapid Transit Corporation]]|accessdate=2012-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smrt.co.kr/program/cyberStation/main2.jsp?lang=e#|title=Subway map|publisher=Seoul Metropolitan Rapid Transit Corporation|accessdate=2012-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tokyo Subway|Tokyo]].

The city's complex and extensive transportation system also includes the longest [[suspension bridge]] in the [[Americas]] and one of the world's longest (the [[Verrazano-Narrows Bridge|Verrazano-Narrows]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;infoplease.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/toptens/worldsuspbridges.html|title=Longest Suspension Bridges in the World|publisher=Pearson Education|accessdate=2012-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Verrazano-Narrows Bridge&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nycroads.com/crossings/verrazano-narrows/ |title=Verrazano-Narrows Bridge |publisher=Eastern Roads |accessdate=2012-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; the world's first mechanically ventilated vehicular [[Holland Tunnel|tunnel]],&lt;ref name = nhlsum&gt;{{cite web | title =  Holland Tunnel | work = National Historic Landmark Quicklinks | publisher = [[National Park Service]] | url = http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=2176&amp;ResourceType=Structure | accessdate =2012-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; more than 12,000 [[Taxicabs of New York City|yellow cabs]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/downloads/pdf/state_of_taxi.pdf |title=The State of the NYC Taxi |publisher=New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission |date=March 9, 2006 |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; an [[Roosevelt Island Tramway|aerial tramway]] that transports commuters between [[Roosevelt Island]] and Manhattan Island, and a ferry system connecting Manhattan to various locales within and outside the city.

The busiest ferry in the United States is the [[Staten Island Ferry]], which annually carries approximately 20 million passengers on the {{convert|5.2|mi|km|sing=on}} run between Staten Island and Lower Manhattan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siferry.com/|title=The Staten Island Ferry|publisher=SIFerry.com.|accessdate=2013-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Staten Island Railway]] rapid transit system solely serves Staten Island. The [[Port Authority Trans-Hudson]] (&quot;PATH&quot; train) links Midtown and Lower Manhattan to [[northeastern New Jersey]], primarily [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]], [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]], and [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]]. Like the New York City Subway, the PATH operates 24 hours a day; meaning two of the four rapid transit systems in the world which operate on 24-hour schedules are wholly or partly in New York (the others are a portion of the [[Chicago 'L']] and the [[PATCO Speedline]] serving Philadelphia).

New York City's public [[MTA Regional Bus Operations|bus fleet]] and commuter rail network are the largest in North America.&lt;ref name=&quot;MTAinfo&quot; /&gt; The rail network, connecting the suburbs in the [[Tri-State Region|tri-state region]] to the city, consists of the [[Long Island Rail Road]], [[Metro-North Railroad]] and [[New Jersey Transit rail operations|New Jersey Transit]]. The combined systems converge at [[Grand Central Terminal]] and [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Pennsylvania Station]] and contain more than 250 stations and 20 rail lines.&lt;ref name=&quot;MTAinfo&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Metropolitan Transportation Authority |title=About the MTA Long Island Rail Road |url=http://www.mta.nyc.ny.us/lirr/pubs/aboutlirr.htm |accessdate=2008-09-01}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To complement New York's vast mass transit network, the city also has an extensive web of [[freeway|expressways]] and [[parkway]]s, that link New York City to [[North Jersey|northern New Jersey]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]], [[Long Island]], and southwestern [[Connecticut]] through various [[Bridges and tunnels in New York City|bridges and tunnels]]. Because these highways serve millions of suburban residents who [[commuting|commute]] into New York City, it is quite common for motorists to be stranded for hours in [[traffic congestion|traffic jams]] that are a daily occurrence, particularly during [[rush hour]].&lt;ref name=&quot;recordonline.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061024/BIZ/610240312/-1/NEWS03 George Washington Bridge turns 75 years old: Huge flag, cake part of celebration], ''[[Times Herald-Record]]'', October 24, 2006. &quot;The party, however, will be small in comparison to the one that the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey organized for 5,000 people to open the bridge to traffic in 1931. And it won't even be on ''what is now the world's busiest bridge'' for fear of snarling traffic.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite New York's reliance on public transit, roads are a defining feature of the city. [[Commissioners' Plan of 1811|Manhattan's street grid plan]] greatly influenced the city's physical development.

===New York City Global Partners network===
In 2006, the Sister City Program of the City of New York, Inc. was restructured and renamed ''New York City Global Partners''. New York City has expanded its international outreach via this program to a network of cities worldwide, promoting the exchange of ideas and [[innovation]] between their citizenry and policymakers, according to the city's website. The list of historic sister cities above was consolidated into the Global Partners network and joined by the cities below,&lt;ref name = GlobalOutreach/&gt; including [[Chongqing]] (Chungking), [[Jakarta]], [[Kuala Lumpur]] and [[Tel Aviv]] (four &quot;non-historic&quot; sister cities of New York).

[[Image:Niagara-North Tonawanda.png|thumb|right|250px|Location within Niagara County.]]

'''North Tonawanda''' is a [[Administrative divisions of New York#City|city]] in [[Niagara County, New York|Niagara County]], [[New York]], [[United States]]. The population was 31,568 at the 2010 census. It is part of the [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]&amp;ndash;[[Niagara Falls, New York|Niagara Falls]] [[Buffalo-Niagara Falls metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]]. The city is named after [[Tonawanda Creek]], its south border.  Tonawanda in the [[Seneca language|Seneca]] tongue means &quot;Swift Running Water&quot;.

Tonawanda Creek, which flows into the Niagara River, once had large stretches of rapids (see [[Rapids, New York]]) until it was tamed with the construction of the [[Erie Canal]]. The city also calls itself &quot;The Lumber City,&quot; due to its past primary industry and once was the largest port on the [[Great Lakes]] during the height of the Erie Canal. Along Goundry Street are mansions built for the lumber barons, including 208 Goundry Street, called &quot;Kent Place&quot;, designed by [[Stanford White]]. It is also home to the 2009 Class AA NYS Football Champion Lumberjacks.

==History==
After the first settlers arrived in 1809, North Tonawanda became part of the town of [[Wheatfield, New York]] in Niagara County, from May 1836. An abortive attempt at a village containing portions in two counties and two towns from January 1854 until April 1857, it was part of the Niagara County/Town of Wheatfield component, with the other portion being located in Erie County and the Town of Tonawanda. The experiment was abandoned after New York State removed the North Tonawanda component from the village. Oral history claims a dispute between merchants was the cause, but the combination of communities in two different counties and two different towns was unwieldy. After becoming a village on May 8, 1865 (still in the Town of Wheatfield, but as part of [[Martinsville, New York]]), North Tonawanda was incorporated as a City on April 24, 1897.&lt;ref name=&quot;nthistorymuseum.org&quot;/&gt;

North Tonawanda is on the north side of the Erie Canal/Tonawanda Creek, across from Erie County, New York and the communities of the City of Tonawanda and the Town of Amherst. The Town of Wheatfield borders North Tonawanda on the north and east; the Niagara River serves as its western border, as Tonawanda Creek is its southern border. North Tonawanda is the second largest city in Niagara County.&lt;ref name=&quot;nthistorymuseum.org&quot;&gt;(http://www.nthistorymuseum.org)&lt;/ref&gt;

North Tonawanda is known as &quot;the Lumber City,&quot; because it was from the mid-19th century through the 1970s, a lumber transportation or forwarding center of significance. Because of the ready availability of lumber, it was the birthplace of the [[Allan Herschell Company|Herschell-Spillman Company/Allan Herschell Co.]], one of the leading manufacturers of [[carousel]]s in America and is now the home of the Herschell Carrousel Factory Museum.&lt;ref name=&quot;nthistorymuseum.org&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(http://www.carouselmuseum.org)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1888, Herschell attracted expatriate Belgian [[Eugene de Kleist]] to North Tonawanda, who started the [[North Tonawanda Barrel Organ Factory]] to produce band organs. Taken over in 1909 by the [[Wurlitzer|Rudolph Wurlitzer Company]] after De Kleist became mayor of North Tonawanda in 1906, Wurlitzer became one of the largest musical instrument manufacturing plants in the world. The Ray H. Bennett Lumber Co., one of more than 150 lumber companies to have called North Tonawanda home, produced kit homes sold around the nation and Canada for 70 years.  Richardson Boat, Buffalo Bolt, Durez Chemical, National Grinding Wheel, Taylor Devices, International Paper, Tonawanda Iron &amp; Steel, Riverside Chemical, and hundreds of other successful manufacturing businesses called North Tonawanda home.

The Railroad Museum of the Niagara Frontier occupies a 1923 Erie Railroad station on Oliver Street. The Riviera Theater and Performing Arts Center on Webster Street, in a restored Italian Renaissance-style building, features plays, concerts, movies and other events, and has a monthly American Theatre Organ concert provided by its 1926 &quot;Mighty Wurlitzer&quot; organ. The theater is one of only a handful in the United States with projectors capable of showing the nitrate film used for silent movies. The Ghostlight Theatre is a community theater in a century-old church. The former Carnegie Library is home to the Carnegie Art Center. An E. B. Green designed building houses the Buffalo Suzuki Strings Musical Arts Center.  An active arts community has developed in the downtown area as well.  The North Tonawanda History Museum occupies the former G. C. Murphy Co. store building on Webster Street in the heart of the Downtown Historic District.&lt;ref name=&quot;nthistorymuseum.org&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CAS1&quot;&gt;Smyczynski, Christine A. (2005), &quot;Western New York: From Niagara Falls and Southern Ontario to the Western Edge of the Finger Lakes&quot;. pp 93-99, 101-102. The Countryman Press: Woodstock, Vermont.&lt;/ref&gt;

Parks in North Tonawanda include Veteran's Park, which has a monument to U.S. Seabees, one to the U.S. Marines, and is working on one to Vietnam War Veterans; Gateway Harbor Park, along the Erie Canal, the site of the annual Canal Fest in July and free concerts and other activities; the {{convert|53|acre|m2|adj=on}} Gratwick-Riverside Park along the Niagara River; and Pine Woods Park, Mayor's Park, and the North Tonawanda Botanical Gardens with a boat launch.&lt;ref name=&quot;nthistorymuseum.org&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CAS1&quot;/&gt;

For further information on North Tonawanda, contact the North Tonawanda History Museum.  A full-length book, &quot;North Tonawanda: The Lumber City,&quot; was produced by the History Museum in 2007 and is available for purchase through the History Museum.&lt;ref name=&quot;nthistorymuseum.org&quot;/&gt;

North Tonawanda was historically a [[sundown town]].&lt;ref&gt;http://sundown.afro.illinois.edu/sundowntownsshow.php?id=241&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Buffalo Norsemen]] played their home games in North Tonawanda during their existence.

==Geography==
North Tonawanda is located at {{Coord|43|2|28|N|78|52|8|W|type:city}} (43.041006, -78.868920).{{GR|1}}

The [[Erie Canal]] defines the southern and the majority of the eastern borders of the city, with the rest of the eastern border made up of Sweeney Street and Old Falls Boulevard.  Niagara Falls Boulevard ([[U.S. Highway 62|US Route 62]]) defines the northeastern border of the city.  The majority of the northern border of the city is a line that runs east-west just above Forbes Terrace, mostly paralleling Ruie Road, with the rest of the northern border being a short northwesterly line that runs from Ward Road to Witmer Road.  The western edge of the city is defined by the [[Niagara River]] and a line that runs just west of and parallel to Witmer Road.  Also, at the southwest corner of the city is Tonawanda Island, which is separated from the mainland by the Little River (Part of the East Branch of the Niagara River) and is part of the city.

The edge of North Tonawanda is sometimes hard to find, because the southern parts of both the Towns of Wheatfield and Pendleton use the 14120 zip code. (14120 is North Tonawanda's zip code.)

==Buildings==
It is home to many historic mansions and a historic cemetery.

The North Tonawanda City Market, established in 1908, is the oldest farmer's market in Niagara County. It is open three days a week year round but busiest in the summer and early fall, when more than 70 area farmers sell there. DeGraff Memorial Hospital also is located in the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;nthistorymuseum.org&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CAS1&quot;/&gt;

The city has a number of properties on the [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Niagara County, New York|National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nris&quot;&gt;{{NRISref|2008a}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They include the [[Carnegie Library (North Tonawanda, New York)|Carnegie Library]], [[Allan Herschell Carousel Factory]], [[Riviera Theatre (North Tonawanda, New York)|Riviera Theatre]], and [[U.S. Post Office (North Tonawanda, New York)|U.S. Post Office]] building.

'''Norwich''' is a [[Administrative divisions of New York#City|city]] in [[Chenango County, New York|Chenango County]], [[New York]], [[United States]]. Surrounded on all sides by the [[Norwich (town), New York|Town of Norwich]],&lt;ref name=&quot;acmemap&quot;&gt;{{cite map

   |title=Norwich city
   |publisher=Acme Mapper 2.0
   |accessdate=2010-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; the city is the [[county seat]] of Chenango County. The name is taken from [[Norwich]], [[England]].{{GR|2}} Its population was 7,190 at the [[United States Census, 2010|2010 census]].{{GR|2}}

[[Norwich Lt. Warren Eaton Airport|Lt. Warren Eaton Airport]] (OIC), serving the area, is located north of the city in the [[North Norwich, New York|Town of North Norwich]].

== History ==
[[File:City of Norwich in New York State 34 train station.jpg|thumb|right|During the 1850s through the mid twentieth-century, many travelers arrived by train]]
[[File:City of Norwich in New York State 43 courthouse.jpg|thumb|right|The Chenango County Courthouse]]
The first settlers arrived around 1788. The Town of Norwich was formed in 1793 from the Towns of [[Union, New York|Union]] (now in [[Broome County, New York|Broome County]]) and [[Bainbridge (town), New York|Bainbridge]]. Afterwards, Norwich, as a &quot;mother town&quot; of the county, lost substantial territory in the formation of new towns. In 1806, Norwich gave up territory to form the Towns of [[Pharsalia, New York|Pharsalia]], [[Plymouth, New York|Plymouth]] and [[Preston, New York|Preston]]. More of Norwich was lost in 1807 to form part of [[New Berlin (town), New York|New Berlin]] and part of the [[Columbus, New York|Town of Columbus]]. In 1808 and 1820, Norwich exchanged territory with the Town of Preston.

The community of Norwich, set itself off from the town in 1816 by incorporating as a village, later becoming the City of Norwich in 1914.

==Geography==
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 2.0&amp;nbsp;square miles (5.3&amp;nbsp;km²), all of it land. Unlike many upstate cities, there are few, if any, defined neighborhoods or districts. Although the city is divided into six wards for political purposes, neighborhoods are seldom referred to in this manner. Typically, locations are described ro referred to by the particular street name, such as &quot;Maydole Street&quot; rather than a colloquial neighborhood name such as &quot;Little Italy&quot;. There are some exceptions:

'''Downtown''' The main commercial district of Norwich. Consisting of North and South Broad Streets, East and West Main Streets, and lesser side streets, including American Avenue, Lackawanna Avenue, and parts of Mechanic, Fair, and Hayes Streets. The downtown district is bordered at the north by Cortland and Mitchell Streets, and to the south by Front Street and Eaton Avenue.

'''Newton Heights''' is an area beginning at the top of the Canasawacta Street Hill, bordered to the east by North Broad Street, the west by the escarpment that leads down to Plymouth Street and the Canasawacta Valley, and to the North by Ridgeland Road. It includes Ridgeland Road, Newton Avenue, Summit Street, Pellet Street and parts of Howard Street and Prospect Street.

'''Hillview''' also known as &quot;the Ford Development&quot; or &quot;Cardboard Hill&quot; (a friendly reference to the prefab nature of some of the houses)is the area behind Gibson School in the northwestern corner of the City. Bounded by Route 12, Thompson Road, and the Gibson School fields, this area is almost entirely residential, and also the location of a nursing facility, the local [[LDS Church]], Cavalry church, and Valley Heights Christian Academy. Streets include Hillview Drive, Hillview Court, Eric Street, Sunset Drive, Wales Drive, and Cavalry Drive. Newer streets in this development include Chirlin Drive, Gerald Drive, and Cole Drive.

Norwich is located in upstate New York, in the [[Chenango River]] Valley. The river winds south along the eastern edge of the city. Along the western border, the Canasawacta Creek flows south, until it unites with the [[Chenango River]] at the southern city limits.  The streets are regularly laid out, many lined with shade trees. The city is bordered by hills to the east and south, where one may find hiking and cross country [[skiing]] trails. The Whaupaunaucau State Forest located in the town of North Norwich is popular for year-round recreation.

=== Location ===
Regionally, Norwich lies almost dead center of the triangle that can be drawn connecting the cities of [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], [[Albany, New York|Albany]], and Binghamton, along Interstates 90, 88, and 81, respectively.  The City is located in the center of this triangle, on the intersection between [[New York State Route 12]] and [[New York State Route 23]].  State Highway 12 is often known simply as &quot;Route 12&quot;, &quot;State Route 12&quot; (or SR12), or merely &quot;12&quot;, and similar naming colloquial conventions with State Highway 23 are used.

Norwich is positioned on Route 12 roughly between the larger cities of [[Utica, New York|Utica]] and access to [[Interstate 90]] to the North, and [[Binghamton, NY]] (and the [[Triple Cities]]) and access to [[Interstate 81]] and Future [[Interstate 86 (east)|Interstate 86]] (currently [[New York State Route 17]], known as the [[Southern Tier Expressway]]) to the south. State Highway 23, which cuts laterally through the northern side of the city, leads eastward to the city of [[Oneonta, New York|Oneonta]] and access to [[Interstate 88 (east)|Interstate 88]] and westward on 23 heads in the direction of [[Cortland, New York|Cortland]] and [[Interstate 81]].

Being slightly closer to Binghamton, Norwich residents and locals tend to have a stronger relationship with the Greater Binghamton Area than with the Utica area. The Greater Binghamton Area of the nicknamed &quot;[[Triple Cities]]&quot; of Binghamton, [[Johnson City, New York|Johnson City]], and [[Endicott, New York|Endicott]], as well as the [[Vestal, New York|Town of Vestal]], known in the area for having a substantial commercial strip along the [[Vestal Parkway]], offers most of the services, goods, chain cuisine and recreational opportunities that are unavailable in Norwich. South Broad Street in Norwich is home to the locally owned first-run movie theater, the Colonia, which offers 3D films, comfortable seating and reasonable prices, but some locals do elect to spend an hours drive and gallons of gas to see movies in a strip mall in the Binghamton area. Norwich does have a burgeoning local restaurant scene. In addition to stalwarts like Nina's, the Ontario, Fred's Inn and Gus' Steakhouse, new additions such as [http://www.twobakeriesandarestaurant.com/Two_Bakeries_and_a_Restaurant/Bohemian_Moon.html The Bohemian Moon] The Blarney Stone, and The Cafe Connection are bringing fresh local and diverse food, drink, and entertainment to the area, and [http://www.yalevilleinn.com/ Yaleville Inn] is only a short drive away. Syracuse and Albany are also occasional, but common, destinations as both of these larger New York cities have large universities, extensive hospital services and the malls and recreational facilities that far surpass those of any of the nearer locations.

==Economy==
[[File:City of Norwich in New York State 17 hospital.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Chenango Memorial Hospital is a major employer in the city]]
Route 12 bisects the city on a north-south axis, becoming North and South Broad Street within city limits.  A community of downtown businesses is found along it. On the north side of town lies the North Plaza, desolate since the departure of anchor tenant Jamesway, and a commercial strip of gas stations and fast food outlets.  To the south are three plazas just outside city limits, featuring supermarkets, gas stations, fast food, a new [[Lowe's]] home center and a recently upgraded [[Walmart|Super Walmart]].

Norwich residents usually travel to the larger nearby cities of Oneonta, Binghamton, Utica, sometimes Cortland, and occasionally the much larger metropolitan areas of Syracuse and Albany, for goods and services unobtainable locally.

==Demographics==
[[File:City of Norwich in New York State 11 house.jpg|thumb|right|A house along a main street]]
As of the [[census]] of 2000, there were 7,355 people, 3,131 households, and 1,671 families residing in the city.  The [[population density]] was 3,609.0 people per square mile (1,392.0/km²). There were 3,500 housing units at an average density of 1,717.4 per square mile (662.4/km²). The racial makeup of the city was 96.48% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 1.39% [[African American (U.S. Census)|Black]] or [[Race (United States Census)|African American]], 0.27% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 0.69% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], 0.19% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]], and 0.98% from two or more races. [[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]] of any race were 0.68% of the population.{{GR|2}}

There were 3,131 households out of which 28.6% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 35.6% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 13.4% had a female householder with no husband present, and 46.6% were non-families. 40.2% of all households were made up of individuals and 19.0% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.19 and the average family size was 2.95.{{GR|2}}

In the city the population was spread out with 24.6% under the age of 18, 8.2% from 18 to 24, 26.1% from 25 to 44, 20.0% from 45 to 64, and 21.2% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 39 years. For every 100 females there were 78.9 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 75.0 males.{{GR|2}}

The median income for a household in the city was $28,485, and the median income for a family was $39,808. Males had a median income of $33,537 versus $24,430 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the city was $17,339. About 14.7% of families and 18.7% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 28.5% of those under age 18 and 9.2% of those age 65 or over.{{GR|2}}

== Commerce ==
[[File:City of Norwich in New York State 42 street scene.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Stores near the center of town]]
For nearly a century, the city hosted the corporate headquarters of the [[Norwich Pharmacal Company]]. (Yes Pharmacal is not a &quot;word&quot; but it was the name.) Formed in 1887 as a partnership between Reverend Lafayette Moore and Oscar G. Bell, a drug store employee, the company grew to become a major developer and manufacturer of medicines and veterinary products. Known affectionately as &quot;The Pharmacy&quot; among city residents, Norwich Pharmaceutical became world famous for its [[Unguentine]] antiseptic dressing (introduced in 1893) and [[Pepto-Bismol]], an upset-stomach and anti-diarrhea medication (introduced in 1901 under a different name). The company merged with Morton International, Inc. in 1969 and later became a subsidiary of [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] in 1982.

From 1845 until 1961, Norwich was also the home of the Maydole Hammer Factory.  The founder, David Maydole, was an enterprising [[blacksmith]] who set out to create a [[hammer]] with a safely attached head. His hammers proved so successful, that Maydole became the largest hammer manufacturer in the [[United States]] by the time of its founder's death in 1892.

The Chenango Canal, the New York, Ontario &amp; Western Railway, and the Delaware, Lackawanna &amp; Western Railroad (later Erie-Lackawanna) once served most of the city's transportation needs.  Indeed, Norwich was the NYO&amp;W's Northern Division point until operations ceased on March 29, 1957.  Until June 2006, the community was served by the New York, Susquehanna and Western Railroad which operated trains on the old DL&amp;W line between Binghamton and Utica.  That service ended as a result of flood damage to the portion of the line between Sangerfield and Chenango Forks.

Norwich is a hub for commercial activity in the surrounding area. The [[Oxford (village), New York|Village of Oxford]], as well as other places like Sherburne and Preston, rely on Norwich for low-intensity shopping, eating, movie-going, and for employment opportunities. Due to the lack of development in the surrounding areas, Norwich has a place of prominence as the most populous location in Chenango county, and the only City on route 12 between Binghamton and Utica. Its strategic location and the presence of many pharmacies, more than three large grocery stores, an assortment of fast food restaurants, and a [[Walmart#Walmart_Supercenter|Walmart Supercenter]] (all of which are practically unavailable on the length of route 12 in a 40-mile radius), make Norwich the first stop for people in surrounding hamlets that don't wish to go to the larger and more-distant areas of Oneonta, Utica or Binghamton. Norwich also has several 24-hour businesses, including a 24-hour supermarket (Price Chopper), three 24-hour gas station/mini-marts, and a 24-hour Super Wal-mart. This is relevant due to the virtual nonexistence of 24-hour businesses elsewhere along route 12, particularly in the nearby communities of Oxford, Sherburne, and Preston.

A new 8 million dollar campus was recently constructed for the City's small [[community college]], an extension branch of [[Morrisville State College]].  This larger Student Community may help increase local commerce, and will even, perhaps, lead to growth or the emergence of a &quot;College Town&quot; atmosphere if current trends continue.

==Culture==
Numerous festivals and events mark the Norwich calendar, with residents looking forward to several annual cultural traditions.  Most notable is the [[Colorscape Chenango Arts Festival]], a two-day event in early September that features regional musicians and artists. The festival drew an estimated 15,000 people in 2005.  Since 1993, the [http://www.chenangobluesfest.org/ Chenango Blues Festival], held at the Chenango County Fairgrounds each August, has attracted thousands and featured nationally renowned artists such as Koko Taylor, the late Luther Allison, and The Fabulous Thunderbirds. Since the early 1990s, the nationally known [[Gus Macker]] organization has hosted a 3-on-3 basketball tournament in early July with hundreds of teams participating each year. Museums include the [[Chenango County Historical Society]] and the [http://www.classiccarmuseum.org/ Northeast Classic Car Museum], which houses over 150 classic cars, including the world's largest collection of Franklin luxury cars.

== History ==
As a halfway point between forts Edward and William Henry, the falls was the site of several battles during the [[French and Indian War]] and the [[Revolutionary War]]. The then-[[Administrative divisions of New York#Hamlet|hamlet]] was mostly destroyed by fire twice during the latter conflict, forcing the [[Quakers]] to abandon the settlement until the war ended in 1783. Fire also ravaged the village in 1864, 1884, and 1902.&lt;ref name=&quot;book&quot;/&gt;

The area was originally called ''Chepontuc'' (Iroquois; &quot;difficult place to get around&quot;), also referred to as the &quot;Great Carrying Place,&quot; but was renamed &quot;The Corners&quot; by European-American settlers.&lt;ref name=&quot;book&quot;/&gt; In 1766 it was renamed Wing's Falls for Abraham Wing – the leader of the group of Quakers who established the permanent settlement – and for the falls on the Hudson River. Wing's claim to the name of the falls and the hamlet was transferred to Colonel Johannes Glen of Schenectady in 1788, either on collection of a debt, as a result of a game of cards, or in exchange for hosting a party for mutual friends, depending on which local legend is believed.&lt;ref name=&quot;roots&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rootsweb.com/~nywarren/countyhistory/smith/xxv_part2.htm |title=History of Warren County, H.

Glens Falls has two historic districts listed on the National Register of Historic Places and the equivalent New York State Register of Historic places. The Fredella Avenue historic district includes a series of unique concrete block structures. The Three Squares Historic District comprises the majority of the Central Business District.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com/ny/Warren/districts.html|title=NEW YORK  – Warren County  – Historic Districts|accessdate=2008-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, several individual structures are listed, some below. Glens Falls does not have a local preservation law protecting these historic resources from demolition or alteration.

Crandall Public Library – While the library has existed since 1893, it did not have its own permanent home until 1931, with the completion of the library building in City Park, on property willed to the library by local entrepreneur Henry Crandall. The building was designed by [[Charles A. Platt]] and built by [[Robert Rheinlander]]; it was renovated and expanded in 1969. Its first renovation and expansion since then was completed in November 2008, involving the demolition of the 1969 addition.&lt;ref name=&quot;CPL&quot;&gt;[http://www.crandalllibrary.org/cplaboutus/history.shtml Crandall Library History]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crandalllibrary.org/pdfs/Crandall%20Beha%20PR%20Package%202007.pdf Expansion project details]&lt;/ref&gt; The library is a part of the [[Southern Adirondack Library System]].

[[Glens Falls Feeder Canal|The Feeder Canal]]– Across from this historic [[canal]] is a hydro-electric power-plant on the Hudson River at Glens Falls. The canal was created circa 1820 to feed water into the [[Champlain Canal]]. During the early 19th century, the [[New York State Canal System]] was crucial to the development of the state's economy. Lime, marble, lumber, and agricultural commodities were shipped from Glens Falls from the docks at the base of Canal Street.

Fort Amherst Road – Located near this road is the site of the former [[Fort Amherst]]. The fort is no longer extant, but portions of the wood foundations were known as late as 1880. The fort constituted a block house marking the half-way point on the road between Fort Edward and [[Fort William Henry]] at the head of [[Lake George (New York)|Lake George]]. This fort system, erected by the British, was built to secure the northern territories of the colony from incursions from the French during the [[French and Indian War]].  A restored fort house complex is available for viewing in the nearby town of [[Fort Ann (town), New York|Fort Ann]].

The oldest building in Glens Falls, located in the downtown area, is one of the few buildings in the city that predates 1864. The stone and brick structure at the bottom of the hill was erected circa 1815 and served as Calvin Robbin's blacksmith shop.

Quaker Meeting House – The [[Quaker]] Meeting House, an [[Italianate]] edifice on Ridge Street, was built in 1875 and originally contained no heating system.

'''Little Falls''' is a [[city]] in [[Herkimer County, New York|Herkimer County]], [[New York]], [[USA]]. The population was 4,946 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. The name is derived from a small [[Waterfall|cataract]] near the city.

The '''City of Little Falls''' is located at the southeastern corner of the [[Little Falls (town), New York|Town of Little Falls]] and is east of [[Utica, New York|Utica]].

Little Falls has a picturesque location on the slope of a narrow and rocky [[defile (geography)|defile]], flowing through which the river falls 45 feet (13 m) in less than a mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km), forming a number of cascades.

==History==
Little Falls was first settled around  1723. The need to [[portage]] around the falls promoted a trading location on the site of the future city, allowing it to be the first settlement in the town.  Many of the earliest residents were [[German Palatines]]. &lt;ref&gt;http://cdm16694.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/fullbrowser/collection/srr_lfpl/id/35/rv/compoundobject/cpd/74/rec/20&lt;/ref&gt;
The small settlement here was destroyed by the Indians and Tories in June, 1782, and the place was not resettled until 1790 and was known at times as &quot;Rockton&quot; and &quot;Rock City.&quot;  Little Falls was incorporated as a village in 1811, and reincorporated in 1827.  The City of Little Falls was chartered in 1895.

The Western Inland Canal (early attempt of the Erie Canal) was constructed in 1792 and helped the local economy. The [[Erie Canal]], completed in 1825, passes through the city. Lock 17 of the New York State Erie Canal replaced the 3 locks of the original 1825 Erie Canal and is {{convert|40.5|ft|m}} in height.

Little Falls was a major [[cheese]] center in the third quarter of the 19th Century.

In 1900, 10,381 people lived in Little Falls, in 1910, 12,273, in 1920, 13,029, and in 1940, 10,163.

===Notable residents===
On the outskirts of the city is the grave and residence of [[Nicholas Herkimer|General Herkimer]] of [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] fame, with a monument erected in 1896.

Nineteenth-century [[soap]] manufacturing magnate [[Benjamin T. Babbitt]] operated a [[machine shop]] in Little Falls early in his career.

Little Falls was the home of [[David H. Burrell]], an inventor and gentleman farmer, who, in 1885, patented the first technically sound oil burner which could burn both liquid and gaseous fuels. In 1985, President [[Ronald Reagan]] declared the year, &quot;Oil Heat Centennial Year&quot; because it marked one hundred years since the [[U.S. Patent Office]] granted, to Burrell, a patent for his furnace. Mr. Burrell was also a pioneer in the local dairy industry with many patents for improved machinery registered in his name. His company, D.H. Burrell and Co., was founded in 1885 to develop and distribute this equipment.

[[Francis Bellamy]], author of the [[Pledge of Allegiance]], lived in the city.&lt;ref&gt;http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/biography/bellamy_f/bellamy_f.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Batavia''' is a [[City (New York)|city]] in [[Genesee County, New York|Genesee County]], [[Western New York|Western]] [[New York]], [[United States|USA]], located near the center of Genesee County, entirely within the [[Batavia (town), New York|Town of Batavia]]. Its population as of the 2010 census was 15,465. The name ''Batavia'' is [[Latin]] for the [[Betuwe]] region of the [[Netherlands]], and honors early Dutch land developers.&lt;ref name=&quot;GCW&quot;&gt;[http://www.co.genesee.ny.us/ Genesee County webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;

Batavia is the county seat of Genesee County. 

The city hosts the [[Batavia Muckdogs]] baseball club of the [[New York-Penn League]]. They won the 2008 championship. In 2006, a national magazine ranked Batavia third among the nation’s [[United States micropolitan area|micropolitans]] based on economic development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rbj.net/fullarticle.cfm?sdid=59296 | date = 2006-03-03 | last = Deckert| first = Andrea| title = Batavia development efforts spotlighted. | publisher = Rochester Business Journal | accessdate = 2007-01-09 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070928055629/http://www.rbj.net/fullarticle.cfm?sdid=59296 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New York State Thruway]] ([[Interstate 90]]) passes north of the city. Genesee County Airport (GVQ) is also located north of the city.

Its [[UN/LOCODE]] is USBIA.

==History==
===The Holland Land Company===
[[Image:Holland land 8911.jpg|thumb|left|300px|All of western [[New York]] was sold through this office of the [[Holland Land Company]]. It is now a museum.]]
{{unref|section|date=August 2012}}
The current City of Batavia was an early settlement in what is today called ''[[Genesee Country]]'', the farthest western region of [[New York]] State, comprising the [[Genesee River|Genesee Valley]] and westward to the [[Niagara River]], [[Lake Erie]], and the [[Pennsylvania]] line. 

The tract purchased in western New York (the Holland Purchase) was a 3,250,000 acre (13,150 km²) portion of the [[Phelps and Gorham Purchase]] that lay west of the Genesee River. It was purchased in December 1792, February 1793, and July 1793 from [[Robert Morris (merchant)|Robert Morris]], a prominent [[American Revolution|Revolutionary]] banker, by the [[Holland Land Company]], a consortium of [[Netherlands|Dutch]] bankers.

The village of Batavia was founded in 1802 by Joseph Ellicott, agent of the [[Holland Land Company]].&lt;ref name = History&gt;[http://history.rays-place.com/ny/batavia-ny.htm History of Batavia, New York] from ''Our County and Its People: A Descriptive and Biographical Record of Genesee County, New York (1899)&lt;/ref&gt; Batavia, New York, was named for the short-lived [[Batavian Republic]] (1795–1806) in honor of the Holland Land Company.

The Batavian Republic was itself named for the [[Batavi (Germanic tribe)|Batavi]], an ancient Germanic tribe, which lived in the area of the Rhine–Maas delta in the central [[Netherlands]]. During the [[Renaissance in the Low Countries]] (1500s) and [[Dutch Golden Age]] (1600), Dutch nationalists formed the &quot;Batavian myth&quot; and argued that the ancient Batavians were the ancestors of the Dutch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://humbox.ac.uk/2443/1/index.html The Batavian Myth]: A Study Pack from the Department of Dutch, University College London&lt;/ref&gt; This region is now known as [[Betuwe]], a Dutch word derived from &quot;Batavia.&quot;

One of the provisions of the sale was that Morris needed to settle the [[Native Americans of the United States|Indian]] title to the land, so he arranged for his son [[Thomas Morris (New York politician)|Thomas Morris]] to negotiate with the [[Iroquois]] at [[Geneseo (village), New York|Geneseo, New York]] in 1797. About 3,000 Iroquois, mostly [[Seneca tribe|Seneca]]s, arrived for the negotiation. Seneca chief and orator [[Red Jacket]] was adamantly against the sale, but his influence was thwarted by freely distributed liquor and trinkets given to the women. In the end he acquiesced and signed the ''Treaty of Big Tree'', in which the tribe sold their rights to the land except for a small portion for $100,000. [[Mary Jemison]], known as ''The White Woman of the Genesee'', who had been captured in a raid and married her Seneca captor, proved to be an able negotiator for the tribe and helped win more favorable terms for them.

In the negotiations Horatio Jones was the translator and [[William Wadsworth (officer)|William Wadsworth]] provided his unfinished home. The land was then [[Surveying|surveyed]] under the supervision of [[Joseph Ellicott]], a monumental task of the biggest land survey ever attempted to that time.

Ellicott, as agent for the company, established a land office in Batavia in 1802.&lt;ref name = History/&gt; The entire purchase was named [[Genesee County, New York|Genesee County]] in 1802, with Batavia as the county seat. The company sold off the purchase until 1846, when the company was dissolved. The phrase &quot;doing a land office business,&quot; which denotes prosperity, dates from this era. The office still exists and is a museum today, designated a [[National Historic Landmark]].

Joseph Ellicott lived in Batavia for many years although he thought [[Buffalo, NY|Buffalo]] would grow to be larger. Batavia has a major street named after him (Ellicott Street), as well as a minor street (Ellicott Avenue), and a large monument in the heart of the city. Batavia was incorporated as a village in 1823.

The present counties of western New York were all laid out from the original Genesee County, and the modern Genesee County is but one of many.  But the entire area as a region is still referred to as ''Genesee Country''. Thus, Batavia was the core from which the rest of western New York was opened for settlement and development.

===The Masonic Scandal===
A scandal erupted in Batavia in 1826, when [[William Morgan (anti-Mason)|William Morgan]], a local ne'er do well was offended by the local [[Freemasonry|Masonic Lodge]] (Western Star Chapter R. A. M. No. 33 of [[Le Roy, New York]]), and threatened to expose the secrets of the lodge. He was arrested on a minor charge, then released when his charge was paid, into the company of several men, with whom he went, apparently unwillingly. It was developed later that the men were Masons, and they carried him to [[Fort Niagara]], where he was held captive, and from whence he disappeared. Although the Masons claimed he was only bribed to cease publication and leave the area forever, public sentiment was that he was murdered. No conviction was ever obtained. His captors were only charged and convicted with his abduction.

The event roused tremendous public furor and anti-Mason sentiment ran high. Anti-Masonry was a factor in politics for many years later, as well as religion. Many [[Methodist Episcopal Church|Methodist Episcopal]] clergy had joined the Masons, and this was one of the reasons the [[Free Methodist Church]] separated.

===The Advent of the Erie Canal===
The [[Erie Canal]] in 1825 bypassed Batavia, going well to the north at [[Albion (village), New York|Albion]] and [[Medina, New York|Medina]], enabling [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] and [[Rochester, Monroe County, New York|Rochester]] to grow much faster. With the sale of the western part of the state completed, Batavia became a small [[industry|industrial]] [[city]] in the heart of an [[agriculture|agricultural]] area. It became known for the [[manufacture]] of [[tractor]]s, agricultural implements, [[sprayer]]s and [[shoe]]s. It also was a [[Die (manufacturing)|tool and die]] making center for industries in other areas.

The largest manufacturer, Johnston Harvester Company came into being in 1868. In 1910, the business was acquired by [[Massey-Ferguson|Massey-Harris Co. Ltd]], and became a subsidiary of that [[Canada|Canadian]] company, founded by [[Daniel Massey (manufacturer)|Daniel Massey]] in 1847.

Batavia grew rapidly in the early 20th century, receiving an influx of [[Poland|Polish]] and [[Italy|Italian]] [[immigrant]]s. The City of Batavia was incorporated in 1915.

===Recent history===
[[Image:Oatka milk 8933.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Oatka Milk plant still processes milk from area [[dairy farm]]s which are fewer but larger in recent times.]]

In recent years much of the heavier industry left for other areas of the US, or abroad, and Batavia became part of what has become known as ''The [[Rust Belt]]''.

From 1985 to 1991, Batavian and journalist [[Terry A. Anderson]] was held captive in [[Lebanon]] by [[Hezbollah]] partisans,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2002/02/19/tem_terry_anderson_talks.html | date = 2002-02-19 | last = Kiesewetter| first = John| title = Terry Anderson talks tough. | publisher = Cincinnati Enquirer| accessdate = 2007-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his sister, Peggy Say, became an ardent campaigner for his release.

The construction of the [[Buffalo Federal Detention Facility]], a federal [[immigration detention]] center adjacent to the airport has provided more jobs in the area, as well as expansion of the airport itself, including lengthening the [[runway]] to accommodate larger aircraft in 2005. Inmates at the detention center have included terrorism suspects, such as [[Nabil Ahmed Farag Soliman]], who embarked on a hunger strike in 1999 after two and a half years in federal detention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=11th&amp;navby=case&amp;no=0111313ORD | date = 2002-07-11 | title = SOLIMAN v US | publisher = US 11th Circuit Court of Appeals| accessdate = 2008-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30F13FF3D5B0C728FDDA80894D8404482&amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fSubjects%2fI%2fImmigration%20and%20Refugees | date = 2000-01-31 | last = Siegal| first = Nina| title = After two years in deportation fight, a hunger strike. | publisher = New York Times| accessdate = 2007-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author [[John Gardner (novelist)|John Gardner]], a Batavia native, set his novel ''[[The Sunlight Dialogues]]'' (1972) in 1960s Batavia. Also a native is [[Bill Kauffman]], a political writer and columnist, whose ''Dispatches from the Muckdog Gazette'' (2002)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=9mrouJnuL64C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_summary_r#PPP15,M1 | last = Kauffman| first = Bill| title = Dispatches from the Muckdog Gazette. | publisher = Macmillan| accessdate = 2008-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; is about the city. Author [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]] references Batavia in his novel, ''[[Tender Is the Night]]'' (1934), plus popular authors [[Stephen King]] and [[Peter Straub]] mention or set parts of their novel, ''[[The Talisman (King &amp; Straub novel)|The Talisman]]'' (1983), in the city.

Batavia was referenced in [[The Simpsons]] Season 8 episode ''[[The Twisted World of Marge Simpson]]'', when the first order to [[Marge Simpson|Marge]]'s [[pretzel]] business after securing the protection of the local [[mafia]] comes from the Meat Packers Union Hall in Batavia.

In August of 2012 Muller Quaker Dairy broke ground on what is to be one of the largest yogurt manufacturing plants in the United States, expected to employee 186 people.  Muller Quaker Dairy is a joint venture between PepsiCo and the Theo Muller Group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://foodingredientsfirst.com/headlines/PepsiCo-Break-Ground-on-Major-New-US-Yogurt-Production-Facility.html PepsiCo Break Ground on Major New US Yogurt Production Facility].

==Geography==
[[Image:Tonawanda mill dam 8928.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Old mill dam at the Big Bend of the Tonawanda, downtown Batavia, New York. The choice of this site for Ellicot's headquarters was probably influenced by a good mill site.]]

'''Kingston''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɪ|ŋ|s|t|ən}} is a [[Administrative divisions of New York#City|city]] in and the [[county seat]] of [[Ulster County, New York|Ulster County]], [[New York]], USA. It is {{convert|91|mi|km|0}} north of [[New York City]] and {{convert|59|mi|km|0}} south of [[Albany, New York|Albany]]. It became New York's first capital in 1777, and was burned by the British on October 16, 1777, after the [[Battles of Saratoga]]. In the 19th century, the city became an important [[transport hub]] after the discovery of [[Rosendale cement|natural cement]] in the region, and had both railroad and canal connections. Passenger rail service has since ceased, and many of the older buildings are part of three historic districts, such as the [[Kingston Stockade District|Stockade District]] uptown, the [[Midtown Neighborhood Broadway Corridor]], and the [[Rondout-West Strand Historic District]] downtown.

==History==
{{New Netherland}} The city of Kingston was first called ''Esopus'' after a local [[Esopus tribe]], then ''Wiltwijck'' (sometimes [[anglicized]] to ''Wiltwyck''). Settled in 1651, it was one of the three large [[Hudson River]] settlements in [[New Netherland]], the other two being [[Beverwyck]], now [[Albany, New York|Albany]], and [[New Amsterdam]], now New York City. In 1777, Kingston became the first capital of [[New York]]. During the summer of 1777, when the New York State constitution was written, New York City was occupied by British troops and Albany (then the second largest settlement in New York and capital of the newly independent State of New York) was under threat of attack by the British. To escape attack, the seat of government was moved downstream to Kingston, which was deemed safer. Ironically, the British never reached Albany, being stopped at Saratoga, but they did reach Kingston. On October 16, 1777, shortly after the [[Battle of Saratoga]], the city was burned by British troops moving up the Hudson River from [[New York City]], disembarking at the mouth of the Rondout Creek on the formation the Dutch had named ''Ponck Hockie''.&lt;ref name=&quot;ponckhockie&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://cityguide.pojonews.com/fe/Heritage/stories/he_ponck_hockie.asp| title = Ponck Hockie was a landing point for British troops | accessdate = 2007-10-10 | first = Bond | last = Brungard | publisher = Poughkeepsie Journal }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=July 2009}} Contrary to popular belief there wasn't a large conflict between the townsfolk and the British invaders. This is because the denizens of Kingston knew of the oncoming fleet. The city had been evacuated by the time the British arrived, residents and the government having removed to [[Hurley (CDP), New York|Hurley, New York]], which the British did not attack. {{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Kingston celebrates and re-enacts the 1777 burning of the city by the British every other year (2013 is the next &quot;burning of Kingston), in an all-city theatrical staging of the event that begins at the Rondout.

The area was a major granary for the colonies at the time, so the British burned large amounts of wheat and all but one or two of the buildings. There is some debate over exactly how much of a fight was put up against the British; one third of the local militia regiment was still to the north at Saratoga, and one third was to the south manning several forts (which were captured days before by the British). This would have left approximately 150 militiamen to defend the city against approximately 2,000 British regulars. 

The Dutch cultural influence in Kingston remained strong through the end of the nineteenth century.

Kingston officially became a city on May 29th, 1872 with the merger of the villages of Rondout and Kingston.&lt;ref&gt;Steuding, Robert 'Rondout A Hudson River Port' pg 155&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bluestone, cement, and coal===
{{Main|Bluestone#In the United States and Canada|l1=Bluestone in North America}}
The town of [[Rondout, New York]], now a part of the city of Kingston, became an important freight hub for the transportation of coal from [[Honesdale, Pennsylvania]] to [[New York City]] through the [[Delaware and Hudson Canal]]. This hub was later used to transport other goods,&lt;ref name=&quot;nps&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/kingston/transport.htm| title = Kingston | accessdate = 2008-09-19 | publisher = National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[bluestone]]. Kingston shaped and shipped most of the bluestone made to create the sidewalks of New York City. [[Rosendale cement|Natural cement]] deposits were found throughout the valley, and in 1844 quarrying began in the &quot;Ponchockie&quot; section of [[Rondout, New York|Rondout]]. The Newark Lime and Cement Company shipped cement throughout the United States, a thriving business until the invention of the cheaper, quicker drying [[Portland Cement]]. Large warehouses of ice sat beside the Hudson river from which the ice was cut during the winter and preserved all year to be used in early refrigeration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C0CE6DB1F3AE533A25756C2A9679C94609FD7CF | work=The New York Times | title=Close Of The Ice Harvest.; Nearly All The Houses Filled--The Largest Crop Ever Gathered | date=1881-01-25 | accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large brick making factories were also located close to this shipping hub.&lt;ref&gt;http://brickcollecting.com/shultz.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hudsonvalleyruins.org/yasinsac/ulster/ekingston.html&lt;/ref&gt; Rondout's central location as a shipping hub ended with the advent of railroads which ran through Rondout and Kingston but could transport their loads through the city without stopping.

==Geography==
[[File:109SNOW07 02 02 07 2.jpg|thumb|Recently restored [[steeple (architecture)|steeple]] in Downtown Kingston, New York]]
Kingston has three recognized area neighborhoods. The Uptown Stockade Area, The Midtown Area, and The Downtown Waterfront Area. The Uptown Stockade [[Kingston Stockade District|Stockade District]] was the first capital of New York State. Meanwhile, the Midtown area is known for its early 20th century industries and plays home to the Ulster Performing Arts Center and the historic City Hall building. The downtown area, once the village of [[Rondout, New York|Rondout]] and now the [[Rondout-West Strand Historic District]], borders the [[Rondout Creek]] and is home to recently redeveloped waterfront . The creek empties into the Hudson River through a large, protected tidal area which was the terminus of the [[Delaware and Hudson Canal]], built to haul coal from Pennsylvania to New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Hudson River Maritime Museum | url =  http://www.hrmm.org/rondout/rondout.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Downtown, called &quot;the Rondout&quot; because it was formerly [[Rondout, New York]], is an artist community labeled by Business Week online as one of &quot;America's best places for artists.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = America's Best Places for Artists | url = http://images.businessweek.com/ss/07/02/0226_artists/index_01.htm | accessdate = 2007-10-10 | publisher = BusinessWeek}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is home to a large number of art galleries. Kingston holds many festivals in the Rondout neighborhood, including the Kingston Jazz Festival and the Artists Soapbox Derby, and Drum Boogie. 

Midtown is the largest of Kingston's neighborhoods and home to Kingston/Benedictine Hospital.

While the Uptown area is noted for its &quot;antique&quot; feeling, the overhangs attached to buildings along Wall and North Front streets were added to historic buildings in the late 1970s and are not authentically part of the 19th century Victorian architecture. The historic covered storefront walks, known as the Pike Plan, were recently reinforced and modernized with skylights. More notably in Uptown is the Stockade district, where many 17th century stone buildings remain. Most notable of these is the [[Senate House State Historic Site|Senate House]], which was built in the 1670s and was used as the state capital during the revolution. Many of these old buildings were burned by the British Oct. 17, 1777, and restored later. A controversial restoration of 1970s-era canopies was marred by the sudden appearance of [[red goats of Kingston|painted red goats]] on planters just prior to the neighborhood's rededication.&lt;ref name=Leonard&gt;{{cite web|last=Leonard|first=DB|title=DB Leonard commentary: Goats go viral|url=http://www.kingstonx.com/2011/11/23/db-leonard-commentary-goats-go-viral/|work=Kingston Times|publisher=Ulster Publishing|accessdate=27 November 2011|date=23 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This part of the city is also the location of the Ulster County Office Building.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 8.6 square miles (22.4&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), of which 7.3 square miles (19.0&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) is land and 1.3 square miles (3.4&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), or 15.03%, is water.

The city is on the west bank of the [[Hudson River]]. Neighboring towns include [[Hurley (town), New York|Hurley]], [[Saugerties (town), New York|Saugerties]], [[Rhinebeck (town), New York|Rhinebeck]], and [[Red Hook, New York|Red Hook]].

==Transportation==
[[File:Kingston CitiBus 052.jpg|thumb|Kingston CitiBus provides service within the city and to Port Ewen.]]
Commuter service is available by bus to [[New York City]] daily via [[Trailways of New York]]. The 90 mile trip takes roughly two hours by motor coach.

Passenger [[railroad]] service to Kingston itself has been discontinued for several decades. However, about {{convert|11|mi|km|-1}} away is the [[Rhinecliff-Kingston (Amtrak station)|Rhinecliff-Kingston]] [[Amtrak]] station, and {{convert|17|mi|km|-1}} away is the Poughkeepsie Amtrak/[[Poughkeepsie (Metro-North station)|Metro-North station]].  [[CSX Transportation]] operates freight rail service through Kingston on the River Line Subdivision. There is also a small rail yard of about 7 tracks in Kingston.

[[New York State Route 199]] has the nearest bridge traversing the [[Hudson River]], {{convert|4.32|mi|km|2}} to the north. [[U.S. Highway 9W]] runs north-south through the city. The [[New York State Thruway]], also known at this section as [[Interstate 87]], runs through the western part of the city.

The area is served by Kingston-Ulster airport (2ON), located at the western base of the Kingston-Rhinecliff bridge. The nearest major airports to Kingston are Stewart International Airport {{convert|39|mi|km|1}} south in Newburgh, and Albany International Airport approximately 65 miles (121&amp;nbsp;km) north.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Traveler's Information | publisher = Ulster County | url = http://www.ulstertourism.info/travlersinfo.html#transport}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three major metropolitan airports for New York City - John F. Kennedy International approximately 93 miles (149&amp;nbsp;km) south, Newark Liberty International approximately 86 miles (139&amp;nbsp;km) south, and LaGuardia Airport approximately 80 miles (129&amp;nbsp;km) south.

City bus service is provided by the city-owned CitiBus system, while service to points elsewhere in Ulster County is provided by [[Ulster County Area Transit]] (UCAT).

On the first Saturday of every month an &quot;art bus&quot; is available for a fare of $1. The bus, usually a CitiBus [[tourist trolley]], takes passengers on a guided tour of the art galleries of Kingston. Kingston's art galleries all have openings on the first Saturday of the month.

Weekend water taxi service between Kingston and [[Rhinecliff, New York]] is available May through October for $10 round-trip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Kingston-Rhinecliff water taxi launches today | publisher = DailyFreeman.com | url = http://www.dailyfreeman.com/articles/2009/05/01/news/doc49fa786b5bf21123589390.txt?viewmode=fullstory}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some trips stop at the [[Rondout Light]]; a tour is available for an additional $5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Lark: Hudson River Water Taxi | publisher = HudsonRiverCruises.com | url = http://www.hudsonrivercruises.com/hudson-river-water-taxi.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kingston historically was an important transportation center for the region. The Hudson River, Rondout Creek and [[Delaware and Hudson Canal]] were important commercial waterways. At one time, Kingston was served by four railroad companies and two trolley lines. Kingston was designated as a New York State Heritage Area with a transportation theme and the [[Hudson River Maritime Museum]] and [[Trolley Museum of New York]] are located on the waterfront. Also, the [[Catskill Mountain Railroad]], a scenic railroad company, runs trains from Kingston on the former [[Ulster and Delaware Railroad|Ulster and Delaware]] right of way.

==Historic churches==
Kingston is home to many historic churches. The oldest church still standing is the First Reformed Protestant Dutch Church of Kingston which was organized in 1659. Referred to as The Old Dutch Church, it is located in Uptown Kingston. 
Many of the city's historic churches populate Wurts street (6 in one block) among them Celebration Chapel is a recently restored church built in 1867 and now a chapel hosting weddings. Another church in the Rondout is located at [[72 Spring Street]]. Trinity Evangelical Lutheran Church was founded in 1849. The original church building at the corner of Hunter Street and Ravine Street burned to the ground in the late 1850s. The current church on Spring Street was built in 1874.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/26/nyregion/new-york-clerks-offices-gird-for-influx-of-gay-couples.html | work=The New York Times | first1=Nicholas | last1=Confessore | first2=Michael | last2=Barbaro | title=New York Clerks' Offices Gird for Influx of Gay Couples | date=2011-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Amsterdam''' is a [[Administrative divisions of New York#City|city]] located in [[Montgomery County, New York]], [[USA]].  As of the 2010 census, the city had a total population of 18,620. The name is derived from the city of [[Amsterdam]] in the [[Netherlands]].

The city of Amsterdam is surrounded on the north, east, and west sides by the [[Administrative divisions of New York#Town|town]] of [[Amsterdam (town), New York|Amsterdam]].  The [[Mohawk River]] runs through the city.  The majority of the city lies on the north bank, but the Port Jackson area on the south side is also part of the city.

==History==
[[Image:Market Street, Amsterdam, NY.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Market Street in 1909]]

The city is within the original, now defunct town of Caughnawaga (meaning &quot;at the rapids&quot;), formed in northern Montgomery County in 1788.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hamilton&quot;&gt;[http://history.rays-place.com/ny/mont-amsterdam.htm Hamilton Child, ''History of Amsterdam, New York;'' Syracuse, New York 1869]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Europeans to settle here were [[Dutch people|Dutch]] immigrants about 1710. They called the community Veeders Mills and Veedersburgh after Albert Veeder, an early mill owner, but residents changed the name to Amsterdam in 1803. In 1773, [[Guy Johnson]] built [[Guy Park]], a stone [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] mansion, but as a [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]], he fled to [[Canada]] during the [[American Revolution|Revolution]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hamilton&quot; /&gt;

It was [[Municipal corporation|incorporated]] as a [[Administrative divisions of New York#Village|village]] on April 20, 1830 from a section of the town of Amsterdam. New [[Municipal corporation#Municipal charters|charters]] in 1854, 1865, and 1875 increased the size of the village.{{citation needed|date=June 2009}} In 1885, Amsterdam became a city, which subsequently increased in size by annexation of the former village of Port Jackson, which became the fifth [[Wards of the United States|ward]] of the city.

The completion of the [[Erie Canal]] in 1825 was an economic boom to the city, and finished in 1875, allowed the city to become an important manufacturing area, primarily of [[carpet]]s.  In 1865, the population of Amsterdam was 5,135.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hamilton&quot; /&gt; By 1920, it was 33,524.

Amsterdam experienced serious flooding damage in the aftermath of [[Hurricane Irene]] in late August 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/02/nyregion/guy-park-manor-in-amsterdam-destroyed-by-irenes-floods.html &quot;Manor That Has Stood for Centuries Teeters in Storm’s Wake&quot;], ''[[New York Times]]'', September 2, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Amsterdam (46th Separate Company) Armory]], [[Amsterdam City Hall]], [[Gray-Jewett House]], [[Green Hill Cemetery (Amsterdam, New York)|Green Hill Cemetery]], [[Greene Mansion]], [[Guy Park]], [[Guy Park Avenue School]], [[Samuel and Johanna Jones Farm]], [[Saint Stanislaus Roman Catholic Church Complex]], [[Samuel Sweet Canal Store]], [[Temple of Israel]], [[United States Post Office (Amsterdam, New York)|United States Post Office]], and [[Vrooman Avenue School]] are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nris&quot;&gt;{{NRISref|version=2009a}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Chalmers Knitting Mills]] was added in 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;nps&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cr.nps.gov/nr/listings/20110121.htm|title=National Register of Historic Places Listings|date=2011-01-21|work=Weekly List of Actions Taken on Properties: 1/10/11 through 1/14/11|publisher=National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 6.3&amp;nbsp;square miles (16.3&amp;nbsp;km²), of which, 5.9&amp;nbsp;square miles (15.4&amp;nbsp;km²) of it is land and 0.3&amp;nbsp;square miles (0.9&amp;nbsp;km²) of it is water.  The total area is 5.41% water.

The [[Mohawk River]], along with the Erie Canal, passes through the south part of the city. The Chuctanunda River flows into the Mohawk at Amsterdam.

[[Image:NY-30.svg|20px]] [[New York State Route 30]], a north-south highway called Market Street in part, crosses the Mohawk River to link the main part of Amsterdam to the [[Image:NYS Thruway Sign.svg|20px]] [[New York State Thruway]]. NY-30 also intersects east west highways [[Image:NY-5.svg|20px]] [[New York State Route 5]] and [[Image:NY-67.svg|20px]] [[New York State Route 67]] in the city.

'''Geneva''' is a [[City (New York)|city]] in [[Ontario County, New York|Ontario]] and [[Seneca County, New York|Seneca]] counties in the [[U.S. state]] of [[New York]]. All land portions of the city are within Ontario County; the water portions are in Seneca County.  The population was 13,261 at the 2010 census.{{GR|2}} Some claim it is named after the city and canton of [[Geneva]] in [[Switzerland]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Others believe the name came from confusion over the letters in the word &quot;Seneca&quot; written in cursive.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Ironically, though its own origin is unclear, the New York city ''is'' known to be the eponym of [[Lake Geneva, Wisconsin]]. 

The city is surrounded by the town of [[Geneva (town), New York|Geneva]]. The city says it is the &quot;Lake Trout Capital of the World.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes01&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=The World Capital of Whatever |publisher=New York Times |date=9/12/1993 |accessdate=11-08-2008 |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE6DC1430F931A2575AC0A965958260 | first=Harold | last=Faber}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2010}}
The site was originally the [[Seneca tribe|Seneca]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] village of ''Kanadasaga''. It became a strongpoint after being fortified by the British against the French and later against the Americans. The village was abandoned following its destruction by the punitive [[Sullivan Expedition]] of 1779, but resettled by Europeans around 1793 as a town developed by the [[The Pulteney Association|Pulteney Association]].

At the conclusion of the Revolutionary War, Lt. Col. Seth Reed, who had fought at Bunker Hill, moved from Massachusetts into Ontario County, where by trade with the Indians he became owner of a tract of land eighteen miles in extent. This occurred in 1787, while Hannah stayed in [[Uxbridge, MA|Uxbridge, Massachusetts]] with the family.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seth&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last= Buford|first= Mary Hunter|authorlink=|coauthor=|title= Seth Read, Lieut.-Col.Continental Army; Pioneer at Geneva, New York, 1787, and at Erie, Penn., June, 1795.

The settlement at Geneva was not yet permanent because of indigenous Seneca Indian attacks, and Seth Read then moved his family to Erie, Pennsylvania becoming the earliest European settlers there. The text states that, Finally, he sold this property and brought his wife and two sons (James Manning and Charles John) to the present site of Erie, arriving on the 17th of June, 1795.&lt;ref name = &quot;PA Bios&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title= PA Biographies; William Ward Reed |publisher = hitoricpa.net |url= http://www.historicpa.net/bios/2w/william-ward-reed.html |accessdate=2007-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The &quot;Village of Geneva&quot; was incorporated in 1806, 1812, and 1871, formally separating it from the surrounding area of Geneva Town. Later the village became a city.

==Geography==
The town is at the two-mile wide northern outlet of [[Seneca Lake (New York)|Seneca Lake]] a lake that spans 34 miles south to [[Watkins Glen, New York|Watkins Glen]].  Geneva is located in the Finger Lakes region, the largest wine-producing area in New York State.  The [[Cayuga-Seneca Canal]] contains the watershed of [[Keuka Lake]] and flows north through Geneva, connecting to the [[Erie Canal]], completed in 1825. 

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 5.8 square miles (15.2&amp;nbsp;km²). 4.3 square miles (11.0&amp;nbsp;km²) of it is land and 1.6 square miles (4.1&amp;nbsp;km²) of it (27.18%) is water.  

Geneva on east-west [[U.S. Highway 20|US Route 20]] conjoined with [[New York State Route 5]]. [[New York State Route 14]] is a north-south highway through the city. It is fairly equidistant from [[Rochester, New York]] and [[Syracuse, New York]], each being about 45 miles away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geneva.ny.us/index.asp?Type=B_LOC&amp;SEC={5FF1CAFB-61A8-4731-B59B-BA8A6F1BA576} |title=The page cannot be found}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=June 2010}}

'''Niagara Falls''' ({{IPAc-en|n|aɪ|ˈ|æ|ɡ|r|ə}} {{respell|ny|AG|ra}}) is a [[City (New York)|city]] in [[Niagara County, New York|Niagara County]], [[New York]],  [[United States]]. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the city had a total [[population]] of 50,193, down from the 55,593 recorded in the [[2000 United States Census|2000 census]]. It is across the [[Niagara River]] from the city of [[Niagara Falls, Ontario]], with both cities named after the famed [[Niagara Falls]] which they share. It is part of the [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]–Niagara Falls [[Buffalo-Niagara Falls metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]] as well as the [[Western New York]] region.

==History==
[[Image:Niagara Falls, New York welcome sign IMG 1298.JPG|left|thumb|Welcome sign at Niagara Falls, New York]]
[[Image:Niagara Falls, NY, City Hall at night IMG 1461.JPG|left|thumb|Niagara Falls City Hall at night]]
[[Image:Niagara.jpg|thumb|left|Niagara Falls in the state of [[New York]]]]
[[Image:Rainbow at Niagara Falls IMG 1331.JPG|left|thumb|[[Rainbow]]s are common at Niagara Falls.]]

The [[Europe]]an migration into the area began in the 17th century with Josh Langevin. The first recorded European to visit the area was Frenchman [[René-Josh Langevin, Sieur de la Salle|Robert de la Salle]], accompanied by Belgian [[priest]] [[Louis Hennepin]], who was the first known European to see the falls. The influx of newcomers may have been a catalyst for already hostile native tribes to turn to open warfare in competition for the fur trade.

The City of Niagara Falls was incorporated on March 17, 1892 from the villages of Manchester and Suspension Bridge, which were parts of the [[Nigara, New York|Town of Niagara]]. [[New York State Governor]] [[Roswell P. Flower]] signed a bill into law forming the city. [[Thomas Vincent Welch]] who was a member of the charter committee and then a New York state assemblyman, but more importantly a second-generation Irishman, was there when the bill was signed, and responsible for asking Governor Flower to sign the bill on [[St. Patrick's Day]]. George W. Wright was elected the first mayor of Niagara Falls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.niagarafallsinfo.com/history-item.php?entry_id=1334&amp;current_category_id=199 |title=Niagara Falls New York Township History - The City of Niagara Falls, New York, USA |publisher=Niagarafallsinfo.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the city was built around factories that utilized the power of the falling water for energy. Now the downtown area borders a park ([[Niagara Falls State Park]]) affording a close-up view of the American, Horseshoe and Bridal Veil Falls.

By the end of the 19th century, the city was a heavy industrial area, due in no small part to the huge power potential offered by the swiftly flowing [[Niagara River]].  There were many industries in Niagara Falls that used the power of the mighty Niagara River. Tourism was considered a secondary niche, while industry was the main producer of jobs and economic backbone.

In 1927, the city annexed the village of La Salle from the [[Niagara, New York|Town of Niagara]]. The village was named for [[René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de la Salle|Robert de la Salle]].

Ever since the early 20th century, the center of the tourist district was Falls Street, a vibrant street that ran into the main part of the city. Although Falls Street no longer exists in the capacity that it once did, efforts are currently being made by the government and private companies to revitalize and restore what is left of the historic thoroughfare.

The 1950s and early 1960s witnessed an economic boom, as several industries moved into the city to take advantage of the hydroelectric power offered, due to a higher demand for household and industrial products. Paper, rubber, plastics, petrochemicals and abrasives were among the major industries located in the city. This brief period of prosperity would end by the mid-1960s, as the locally owned Schoellkopf Power Project &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Moses_Niagara_Hydroelectric_Power_Stationlater | title=Robert Moses Niagara Hydroelectric Power Station |publisher=encyclopedia |date=2012-11-13|accessdate=2012-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; collapsed into the Niagara River, ending an industrial era.

To take advantage of the hydroelectric power offered, New York City urban planner [[Robert Moses]] built a new power plant in nearby [[Lewiston, New York]]. However, Niagara Falls did not get much of the power created; Most of it went downstate to fuel growing demands for New York City.

The [[Neighbourhood|neighborhood]] of [[Love Canal]] gained national media attention in 1978 when United States President [[Jimmy Carter]] declared a federal emergency there, and hundreds of residents were relocated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Love Canal Collection | publisher = University of Buffalo Libraries | url = http://library.buffalo.edu/libraries/projects/lovecanal/introduction.html | accessdate = 2007-02-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 1920, the area had been used as a [[landfill]] for chemical waste disposal (and later, industrial [[toxic waste]]) before its development as a residential area. The [[Superfund]] law, which protects people, families, communities and others from heavily contaminated toxic waste sites, was enacted in 1980 in response to the Love Canal situation.

The post-Love Canal Niagara Falls witnessed a reversal of fortunes, as what was once cheap to produce in Niagara Falls was now far cheaper to outsource to other countries. Several factories closed, and the population has since dropped by half, as blue-collar workers fled the city in search of jobs elsewhere. The city's economy plummeted downward when a failed [[urban renewal]] project took place resulting in the destruction of Falls Street and the tourist district.

In 1995, the city government was the defendant in ''[[NAACP]]'' v. ''City of Niagara Falls'', which named, among others, then-Mayor Jacob Palillo; City Council Members, G. Tom Sottile, Barbara A. Geracitano, Andrew Walker, Henry Buchalski, Michael Gawel, Anthony Quaranto, John G. Accardo; and City Clerk, Elsie Paradise. NAACP charged that the city was violating Section 2 of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]]. At the time, Niagara Falls' government consisted of a mayor, who acted as chief executive, and seven city council members elected at-large. The NAACP further argued that the city had not given enough representation to [[African Americans]] living in the city, which at that time comprised 15.58% of the city's population. The court ruled in favor of the city, which kept its system of government.

Currently, the city's main industry is tourism. In 2004, the [[Seneca tribe|Seneca Nation of Indians]] opened the [[Seneca Niagara Casino]] in the former [[Niagara Falls Convention and Civic Center]], thereby establishing sovereign [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] territory in the midst of the city. The city, however, continues to struggle economically.

In 2001, the entire [[corrupt]] leadership of [[Laborers' International Union of North America|Laborers Local 91]] were found guilty of [[extortion]], [[racketeering]] and other crimes following an exposé by Mike Hudson of the ''[[Niagara Falls Reporter]]''. However, union boss Michael &quot;Butch&quot; Quarcini died before trial began, although the rest of the union leadership was sentenced to prison.

In early 2010, former Niagara Falls Mayor Vincent Anello was indicted on federal charges of [[political corruption|corruption]]. Although not related to his political career, Anello, a master electrician by trade, was also sentenced to 13 months in jail for pension fraud regarding a pension from the [[International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers]], of which he is a member.

The decline of the city was given national exposure by [[Bloomberg Businessweek]] magazine in a [http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/10_50/b4207078529793.htm cover story].

On November 30, 2010, the New York State Attorney General entered into an agreement with the city and its police department to create new policies to govern police practices in response to claims of excessive force and police misconduct.  The city will create policies and procedures to prevent and respond to allegations of excessive force, and to ensure that police are properly trained and complaints are properly investigated.  Prior claims filed by residents will be evaluated by an independent panel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ag.ny.gov/media_center/2010/nov/nov30a_10.html, New York State Office of the Attorney General ATTORNEY GENERAL CUOMO REACHES AGREEMENT WITH THE CITY OF NIAGARA FALLS TO REFORM ITS POLICE PRACTICES]&lt;/ref&gt;

The city has a number of properties on the [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Niagara County, New York|National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nris&quot;&gt;{{NRISref|2008a}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also has three national [[Historic district (United States)|historic district]]s including: [[Chilton Avenue-Orchard Parkway Historic District]], [[Deveaux School Historic District]], and the [[Park Place Historic District (Niagara Falls, New York)|Park Place Historic District]].

==Economy==
{{POV-section|date=March 2011}}
[[Image:Niagara falls fallen industry.jpg|thumb|Abandoned industry in &quot;Chemical Row&quot;, at 1920 Buffalo Avenue.]]
[[File:Hotel Niagara.jpg|thumb|Hotel Niagara Pre-renovation 2011]]
[[Image:Closed Hotel Niagara in Niagara Falls, NY IMG 1324.JPG|thumb|The Hotel Niagara Building, 201 Rainbow Blvd., pre-renovation.]]

The economy for the city was originally based around the Falls itself, or at least the power generated by the massive waterfall. This cheap and abundant source of power was the driving force behind the rapid rise of area industry. Around the turn of the 20th century, thousands of immigrants from predominantly European nations such as [[Italy]] and [[Poland]] came to the area to work the  chemical, steel, and manufacturing plants owned by present-day companies such as Occidental.

The area is subject to the migration of manufacturing jobs to developing countries common to the [[rust belt]]. Another major toll was suburban migration, a national trend. The city, which once boasted well over 100,000 people at its peak, has seen its population decline by some 50%, as industries shut down and people left for the employment opportunities of the South and West. The unemployment rate in the City of Niagara Falls was around 10 percent as of October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.city-data.com/city/Niagara-Falls-New-York.html |title=Niagara Falls, New York (NY) profile: population, maps, real estate, averages, homes, statistics, relocation, travel, jobs, hospitals, schools, crime, moving, houses, news, sex offenders |publisher=City-data.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 60 percent of residents in Niagara Falls receive public assistance such as [[food stamps]], [[American welfare state|welfare]], [[unemployment insurance]] and [[Medicaid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/washington/2010-08-30-1Asafetynet30_ST_N.htm?utm_source=Newsletter&amp;utm_medium=Email&amp;utm_campaign=Heritage%2BHotsheet&amp;loc=interstitialskip |title=Record number in government anti-poverty programs |publisher=Richard Wolf |date=2010-08-30 |accessdate= 2012-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also blamed for the economic decline is the presence of the [[New York Power Authority]], whom politicians, reporters and residents{{who|date=March 2013}} have blamed for charging the city high electric bills, rendering the draw of cheap power obsolete.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} The [[New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation]], and especially the [[Niagara Frontier Parks Commission]] (a division of the department), has also been blamed for placing souvenir stands, parking lots and restaurants within [[Niagara Falls State Park]], which may have resulted in tourists not patronizing businesses in the city.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Recently,{{when|date=March 2013}} state officials have been negotiating with state park and NYPA officials, such as Assemblyman [[John Ceretto]] of Lewiston asking the NYPA if they would nominate a resident of Niagara County to the Board of Directors, since the [[Robert Moses Niagara Hydroelectric Power Station]] in Lewiston is the most profitable project undertaken by NYPA and generates the most power.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Local and state government officials have vowed to embrace the physical and cultural advantages that the Niagara region naturally possesses, such as the Niagara Gorge, wine trail, historical landmarks, Little Italy Niagara, or [[Niagara Falls]] itself. These marketing efforts have attempted to move focus away from the city's industrial past to embrace a tourism-based economy. In late 2001, the State of New York established the [http://usaniagara.com USA Niagara Development Corporation], a subsidiary to the State's economic development agency, to focus specifically on facilitating development in downtown Niagara Falls, NY. However, the organization has been criticized for making little progress and doing little to improve Niagara Falls' economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Anonymous |url=http://www.niagara-gazette.com/archivesearch/local_story_215232302.html |title=NIAGARA FALLS: Tourism talk turns heated » Local News |publisher=Niagara Gazette |date=2009-08-03 |accessdate=2012-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.niagara-gazette.com/archivesearch/local_story_032214739.html |title=USA NIAGARA: The ‘Times Square’ promise » Local News |publisher=Niagara Gazette |date=2009-02-01 |accessdate=2012-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Falls' current development strategy is focused on a pragmatic approach to revitalizing vacant and underutilized buildings in the downtown area as high profile catalyst projects with real economic impact. But the cost to demolish the city's many abandoned buildings may make it impossible to address all the eyesores, according to officials,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jewell |first=Denise |url=http://www.niagara-gazette.com/archivesearch/local_story_132233620.html |title=The cost of neglect in the Falls » Local News |publisher=Niagara Gazette |date=2006-05-12 |accessdate=2012-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; but some have criticized the city of wasting funds elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.niagara-gazette.com/archivesearch/local_story_257235517.html |title=NIAGARA FALLS: Block clubs want more derelict homes demolished » Local News |publisher=Niagara Gazette |date=2008-09-15 |accessdate=2012-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opening of the new [http://conferencecenterniagarafalls.com Conference Center Niagara Falls] in 2005; the redevelopment of the historic [[United Office Building]] and [[The Niagara]] (hotel); the restoration of Old Falls Street, once the primary tourist thoroughfare downtown but reduced to a pedestrian mall; the redevelopment of the former Holiday Inn Select as a new Sheraton resort with several restaurants including the city's first [[Starbucks]] Coffee; and other attractions such as the planned [[Niagara Experience Center]]; and of course, the [[Seneca Niagara Casino]], attempt to reposition Niagara Falls as a premiere destination.

The arrival of the Seneca Niagara Casino in 2002 was a major undertaking designed to renew in the city's downtown area. However as of late 2012 the anticipated economic renewal the casino was supposed to bring has not been felt in the local area to the extent previously envisioned.

Niagara Falls is currently visited by almost ten million people each year and is considered one of the United States' top ten tourist destinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bulletnewsniagara.ca/2011/09/18/niagara-falls-ranked-in-top-10-u-s-destination-by-forbes |title=Niagara Falls ranked in top 10 U.S. destinations by Forbes | publisher=[[Niagara Frontier Publications]] |date=|accessdate= 2012-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official tourism promotion agency, Niagara Tourism and Convention Corporation (NTCC), was adopted in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.niagara-usa.com/ntcc_about.html ]{{dead link|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;The Mission of the NTCC is quite simple: to enhance the economic prosperity of Niagara County by promoting, selling and marketing the County as a premier destination for meetings, conventions and leisure tourism.

From 1982 to 2000, a [[shopping mall]] called [[Rainbow Centre Factory Outlet]] operated downtown on city land leased to The Cordish Companies. The mall was built in an effort to revitalize the downtown. The owner, David Cordish, was criticized for not keeping the mall stores rented out but The Cordish Company criticized the City Government for not maintaining the building. Cordish eventually shuttered the building and stopped paying rent in anticipation that the company would be bought out of the lease. In October 2010, Cordish announced that he would donate the 300,000 sq ft facility to [[Niagara County Community College]] to assist in the college's development of a hospitality and tourism complex that would include all of the college's hospitality and tourism programs including culinary arts, baking and pastry, winery operations, casino operations, hospitality operations, and food and beverage management. The unique complex includes fully operational retail entities operated by the academic programs serving as internship/practice sites for the students including a fully operational restaurant and lounge, Barnes and Noble boutique culinary bookstore, New York Style Deli, French Pastry Shoppe and a Wine Boutique. NCCC has set August 31, 2012 as the opening date/dedication of the 90,000 sq ft facility, giving the rest of it to the City of Niagara Falls to further develop it. Mr. Cordish also donated the one acre &quot;balloon launch&quot; property to the NCCC Foundation which then turned that property over to the city for future development.

There is also an [[outlet mall]] called [[Fashion Outlets of Niagara Falls]], formerly &quot;Prime Outlets Niagara&quot;, which is not actually part of the city, but of the town of [[Niagara, New York]], which shares a post office with the city.

The Wintergarden was an all-glass indoor arboretum designed by [[Cesar Pelli]] adjacent to the Rainbow Centre and over Old Falls Street. It operated as an arboretum from its 1977 opening until 2003, when it was closed due to rising maintenance costs. The city then sold the structure to local developer Joseph Anderson, who operated it as Smokin Joe's Family Fun Center from 2003 to 2007. It was demolished in 2009 in order to improve vehicular and pedestrian traffic on Old Falls Street.

===Little Italy===

'''Little Italy''' is an area full of restaurants, bakeries, and pizzerias extending along Pine Avenue. It historically was the home to a large Italian-American population. Italian Americans built such institutions as St. Joseph's Church, the Cristoforo Colombo Society (1903) and Colombus Square Park. The park serves as the center of Italian culture with its bocce courts, summer concerts and the Italian Festival. Currently Council Chairman Sam Fruscione produces a weekly [[Public-access television]] [[cable TV]] show promoting Little Italy Niagara.

===North End===

'''The North End''', like Little Italy, has declined significantly over the years. Originally a booming industrial district (predominately Polish and German, especially along Highland Avenue) since the 1940s the areas surrounding Highland Avenue have been predominately African-American, several of the industries have closed and the area has become neglected. Recently, &quot;green&quot; industry has begun to move into the North End, bringing back some jobs. The relocation of the [[Niagara Falls, New York (Amtrak station)|Niagara Falls Train Station]] is expected to help the area, as well as new development on nearby Main Street. It is mainly considered to be anything located north of the primary railroad tracks within the city, with the exception of west of Ninth Street. Several housing projects have been built within the area, including Center Court, Harry S. Jordan Gardens, the proposed HOPE VI houses, and the infamous Unity Park projects. The North End for most of the 20th century was predominately a Polish, German and Italian neighborhood.

===Deveaux===

This neighborhood has managed to stay well kept with brick and all stone houses from the early to mid 20th century adjacent to the beautiful Niagara Escarpment.

===LaSalle===

'''LaSalle''' is a large, vaguely defined middle-class neighborhood considered to be anything east of 56th Street. It is the site of [[Love Canal]], an infamous toxic waste landfill that was sold to the city for purposes of building a school in the early 1950s. It is named for [[René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle|Robert de la Salle]], a [[French people|French]] explorer who launches his boat, the ''[[Le Griffon|Griffon]]'' from the approximate location of Griffon Park on Buffalo Avenue. In recent years, the main retail area of downtown Niagara Falls has moved from the South End near the falls to [[New York State Route 265|Military Road]] and [[U.S. Route 62|Niagara Falls Boulevard]], giving a significant economic boost to the area.

===Downtown===

[[Image:Niagara Falls New York South End.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A picture of the south end of Niagara Falls, NY Taken by Joseph Augstell|A scene of Falls Street west of John B. Daly Boulevard.]]

'''Downtown''', also known as the '''South End''' is the area of the city that adjoins [[Niagara Falls State Park]]. It is the main tourist district in the city, especially so in locations south of Niagara Street. However, it has declined significantly since a failed [[Urban renewal]] project took place in the 1960s resulting in the demolition of the historic Falls Street tourist district. Recently, efforts have been made to restore Falls Street and the downtown to its original grandeur, including the resurrection of Third Street as the entertainment district, and the arrival of the [[Seneca Niagara Casino]].

===Niagara Street/East Side===

'''Niagara Street''' is the main thoroughfare in the area known as the '''East Side'''. It is the historic home to a significant Middle [[Europe]]an population, especially [[Poles|Polish]] and [[Germans|German]] immigrants. Students in the area are served by the new Niagara Street School in between Niagara Street and Welch Avenue.

===Buffalo Avenue===

Starting at the Goat Island bridges to the Falls, Buffalo Avenue during the late 19th and early 20th centuries was the center of Niagara Falls society. Home to the Niagara Club the street was also filled with a number of significant and socially relevant large private mansions of distinction. Heading east from the Niagara Falls residential district the avenue became increasingly industrial. After the decline of several industrial areas in the city, '''Buffalo Avenue''' has remained the primary industrial section of the city for a century, although today the heavy manufacturing, mainly of [[petrochemicals]] and [[electrochemicals]], occurs at a significantly diminished rate from a half-century ago when the city was at its peak. Several chemical factories are located along Buffalo Avenue between John B. Daly Boulevard and 56th Street.  Buffalo Avenue is also the home to many pot holes that resemble sinkholes.  The city decided to remedy the problem by lining the street with Caution Bumpy Road signs.

===Hyde Park===

'''Hyde Park''' is a neighborhood surrounding [[Hyde Park (Niagara Falls, New York)|Hyde Park]], the largest city park in [[New York State]] other than [[Manhattan]]'s [[Central Park]]. Other than Hyde Park, Niagara Falls has 24 other parks.

==Transportation==

'''Air'''
*[[Niagara Falls International Airport]]
*[[Buffalo Niagara International Airport]]
*[[Toronto]]'s [[Pearson International Airport]] on the Canadian side offers direct service with foreign airlines to other countries.

'''Rail'''
*[[Amtrak]] has a [[Niagara Falls, New York (Amtrak station)|station]] at 27th Street and Lockport Road

'''Ground'''
*[[NFTA]] is the public transit provider in [[Niagara County]] and [[Erie County, New York|Erie County]] with hubs at [[Portage Road Transit Center]] and [[Niagara Falls Transportation Center]].

NFTA replaced two local bus operators in the 1950s: Lockport Bus Lines and Niagara Falls Municipal Transit System.

'''Tonawanda''' (formally  ''City of Tonawanda'', from ''Tahnawá•teh'' meaning &quot;confluent stream&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.snowwowl.com/namemeaning.html&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Tuscarora language|Tuscarora]]&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Rudes, B. ''Tuscarora English Dictionary'' Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;)  ([[Cayuga language|Cayuga]]: ''Tganawai:ˀ''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[Administrative divisions of New York#City|city]] in [[Erie County, New York|Erie County]], [[New York]], [[United States]]. The population was 15,130 at the 2010 census. It is located at the northern edge of Erie County, south across the [[Erie Canal]] ([[Tonawanda Creek]]) from [[North Tonawanda]], and north of [[Buffalo, New York]]. It is part of the [[Buffalo-Niagara Falls metropolitan area]].

==History==
According to [[William Bright]] the best that can be said of the origin and meaning of the place name &quot;Tonawanda&quot; is that it is &quot;probably from an Iroquoian source, but of unclear derivation&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bright2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Bright|first=William|authorlink=William Bright|title=Native American placenames of the United States|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5XfxzCm1qa4C&amp;pg=PA505|accessdate=10 June 2011|year=2004|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=978-0-8061-3598-4|page=505}}&lt;/ref&gt; One theory is that it is a [[loanword]] from [[Tuscarora language|Tuscarora]]: ''Tahnawá•teh'' meaning &quot;confluent stream.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; The [[Iroquoian]]-speaking Tuscarora are one of the [[Iroquois Confederacy|Six Nations]] of the ''[[Haudenosaunee]]'' ([[Iroquois Confederacy]]) in the 18th century. They and the Oneida were allies of the American colonists in the [[American Revolutionary War]].

Post-Revolutionary War European-American settlement at Tonawanda began with Henry Anguish, who built a log home in 1808. He added to the hamlet in 1811 with a tavern, both on the south side of Tonawanda Creek where it empties into the [[Niagara River]]. The hamlet grew slowly until the opening of the [[Erie Canal]], completed in the course of the creek in 1825. The [[Tonawanda (town), New York|Town of Tonawanda]] was incorporated in 1836. The Erie Canal and the railroads that soon followed it provided economic opportunity. By the end of the 19th century, both sides of the canal were devoted to businesses as part of a leading lumber processing center. In the mid-19th century, the business center of Tonawanda was incorporated as a village within the town. The village united in a corporation with North Tonawanda across the canal. This corporation fell apart, and in 1904 the village was incorporated as the City of Tonawanda.

On September 26, 1898, a tornado struck the City of Tonawanda. After crossing over the river from Grand Island, the tornado damaged the old Murray School as well as several homes along Franklin and Kohler streets. Its worst havoc was wreaked along Fuller Avenue, where a dozen homes were severely damaged, several being leveled to the ground. No one was killed by the fierce storm, but there were numerous injuries.

===Spaulding Fibre===
Spaulding Fibre became a manufacturer of leatherboard (made from leather scraps and wood pulp), transformer board, vulcanized fibre, [[bakelite]] (under the trade name Spauldite) and Filawound ([[fiberglass]]) tube.  Operating in Tonawanda from 1911 to 1992, it became the major employer in the city.  The company was founded in 1873 with a leatherboard mill by Jonas Spaulding and his brother Waldo in [[Townsend Harbor, Massachusetts]]. They did business as The Spaulding Brothers Company. Jonas Spaulding had three sons: Leon C., [[Huntley N. Spaulding|Huntley N.]] and [[Rolland H. Spaulding|Rolland H.]].

With industry expanding, Jonas established leatherboard mills at [[Milton, New Hampshire|Milton]] and North [[Rochester, New Hampshire]], in part to allow his sons to join him in the business. The New Hampshire mills operated under the name J. Spaulding and Sons. After Jonas Spaulding's death in 1900, his sons (by then living in New Hampshire, where they had corporate headquarters at Rochester) continued to operate these mills successfully. They brought the Townsend Harbor mill under the J. Spaulding and Sons banner in 1902.

With continued success, the three Spaulding brothers added a [[vulcanized fibre]] operation in Tonawanda, New York in 1911.  They added a fourth leatherboard mill in Milton (second in this community) in 1913. The mayor of Tonawanda, Charles Zuckmaier, had solicited the Spaulding brothers’ business in Tonawanda.&lt;ref&gt;Dave Hill, ''Tonawanda News'', &quot;SPAULDING FIBRE: From prosperity to decline&quot;, January 16, 2008 12:26 am&lt;/ref&gt;  An official ground-breaking ceremony was held on July 17, 1911, for the new plant, a $600,000 investment by J. Spaulding and Sons. Operations at the plant began on April 1, 1912, with 40 employees. The daily capacity of the plant at that time was five tons of fibre sheeting and one ton of fibre tubing.

&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Red Chip 2.JPG|thumb|Spaulding Fibre Company Promotional Red Vulcanized Fibre Poker Chip|{{Deletable image-caption|1=Sunday, 31 August 2008|date=March 2012}}|{{Deletable image-caption|1=Sunday, 31 August 2008|date=March 2012}}]] --&gt;
Around 1927, the sons changed the name of the company to the Spaulding Fibre Company. In the 1930s, they added a second product at the Tonawanda plant: Spauldite, a &quot;me too&quot; phenol formaldehyde [[resin]] material made to compete with [[Bakelite]]. The trademark now owned by Spaulding Composites can be applied to [[laminates]] made with other natural or synthetic resins as well.

After Huntley Spaulding, the last of the three brothers, died in November 1955, the Spaulding Fibre Company became part of a charitable trust previously set up by Huntley and his only sister, Marion S. Potter. The trust was created to disburse their remaining wealth within 15 years of the death of the last sibling. Marion S. Potter died on September 27, 1957.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene C. Struckhoff, &quot;The orange tree and the inchworm: an abbreviated history of the Spaulding-Potter Charitable Trusts&quot;, Concord, NH; 1973&lt;/ref&gt;

The company in Tonawanda flourished under foremen, superintendents and workers from the local blue collar workforce. It also attracted new residents who came for the jobs. One was Richard Spencer, who left the [[oil fields]] of [[Bradford, Pennsylvania]], to be a superintendent for two decades. He managed through several labor strikes and periods of economic unrest for the company.

In 1956 the Tonawanda plant completed an expansion that doubled the paper mill and the vulcanized fibre-making capacity of the plant. In addition, after the death of Huntley Spaulding, corporate offices relocated to Wheeler Street from Rochester, New Hampshire. In the 1960s, the Tonawanda plant added a third product line, Filawound ([[fiberglass]]) tubing.

The 50th anniversary of the Wheeler Street Plant in 1961 was marked by a special 22-page section in the ''Tonawanda News''. The Wheeler Street Plant reportedly covered {{convert|610000|sqft|m2}}, employed 1500 workers, and had an annual payroll of $9,000,000. The company paid $153,818 in city taxes that year and was Tonawanda’s largest tax payer. The plant was nearing its peak, but there was more expansion to come.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecidany.com/news.asp?ID=66 ECIDA - Erie County Industrial Development Agency: News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, the charitable trust sold the Spaulding Fibre Company to Monogram Industries.  The Tonawanda plant began a slow decline during a period of industrial restructuring and product and manufacturing changes. In 1984, Monogram Industries sold the Spaulding Fibre Company to [[Nortek]]. In 1988, Nortek changed the company name to Spaulding Composites. Spaulding Composites closed the Tonawanda plant on August 24, 1992.

By the time the plant closed, employment had declined to 300. Since the closure of the Tonawanda plant, Spaulding Composites twice filed for bankruptcy. The plant site had a footprint of {{convert|860000|sqft|m2}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecidany.com/news.asp?ID=66 ECIDA - Erie County Industrial Development Agency: News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  It fell into disrepair and, because of the wastes of the industrial processes, was classified as a [[brown field]] site under environmental regulations.

In 2006, the Erie County Development Agency contracted for demolition of the derelict facilities.  It was punctuated by the felling of the {{convert|250|ft|m|sing=on}}-tall smoke stack that dominated the site.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Mcneil; &quot;Demolition marks end of era: Smokestack at old Spaulding Fibre plant comes a-tumbling down&quot;, ''The Buffalo News'', 22 Dec 2006&lt;/ref&gt; (This event is documented with a handful of videos on YouTube.)

===Neighborhoods and locations in the City of Tonawanda===
* '''Gastown''' &amp;ndash; A neighborhood in the northeast corner of Tonawanda, bordering the Erie Canal. Its name comes from the Gas Light Co., which was built on Long's Point, home of the historical Long's Homestead.
* '''&quot;The Hill&quot;''' (aka &quot;Riverview&quot;) &amp;ndash; A region centered around Tonawanda High School, so named because of its slightly elevated topography when compared with the rest of the relatively flat city. It is also known as Clay Hill as it was formed by a terminal glacial moraine that deposited the clay that forms the hill. The area near the high school was the site of some popular clay tennis courts for the city.
* '''Millstream''' &amp;ndash; A neighborhood on the eastern side of the city. It is named for a stream that formerly flowed through the area, but has since been mostly channelled underground.
* '''Ives''' &amp;ndash; a local skatepark, ice hockey rink, soccer field, and tennis court in the middle of Tonawanda. Starting out as a small blue kiddy pool, was remodelled to become a skatepark and other things.

The City of Tonawanda is called by many of its residents the &quot;C.O.T.&quot;, meaning the &quot;City&quot; rather than &quot;Town&quot; of Tonawanda.

===Major highways in the City of Tonawanda===
* [[Image:NY-265.svg|22px]] [[New York State Route 265]] (Main St., Seymour St., River Rd.) North-South Roadway from the Tonawanda town line (south) north through the city and over the Erie Canal/Tonawanda Creek into North Tonawanda.

(This is a major transportation route for traffic to-and-from North Tonawanda and beyond).

==Culture==

===Canal Fest===
In conjunction with the City of North Tonawanda, the City of Tonawanda celebrates an annual '''Canal Festival'''. For one week, members of both communities celebrate Tonawanda's historic location on the western end of the Erie Canal in the largest festival of its kind. The Festival began in 1983 when Freemasons in the area, in conjunction with several state and regional leaders, set out to promote the businesses of the Tonawandas, provide fund raising opportunities for local non-profit organizations, and provide recreational activities for the citizens of both Tonawanda and North Tonawanda.

The first Canal Fest was held on both sides of the canal in 1983. Today, the Canal fest is organized by the Canal Fest of the Tonawandas Inc., a non-profit organization. It is estimated that over 150,000 people attend the Canal Fest each year, though an accurate number is impossible to obtain since attending the event is entirely free of charge and there are no turnstiles to measure crowds. The Canal Fest is the largest event held along the Erie Canal today and is in the top percentile of New York State events.

===Gateway Harbor===
Also in conjunction with the city of North Tonawanda, Tonawanda is home to Gateway Harbor, a public park that runs along the Erie Canal just before it joins the Niagara River. During summer months, local boaters are free to dock at the park, and the area becomes quite popular during the free concerts set up by the local chamber of commerce. Various local businesses sponsor a series of concerts on both the Tonawanda and North Tonawanda sides of the park.

The Historical Society of the Tonawandas operates a museum in the former New York Central &amp; Hudson Valley Railroad station, which has exhibits depicting the area's lumber industry and Erie Canal history. The Long Homestead is a restored Pennsylvania German-style house built in 1829 and containing period furniture from the early 19th century (guided tours are provided by the Historical Society of the Tonawandas). Isle View Park, on the Niagara River overlooking Grand Island, is available for biking, hiking, rollerblading, fishing and launching boats. The Riverwalk trail passes through the park, and a pedestrian foot bridge connects the partk to Niawanda Park.&lt;ref&gt;Smyczynski, Christine A.

==Tonawanda in popular culture==
Tonawanda is mentioned as the home of the fictional character '''Louis Philip Perew''', in the [[alternate history]] world created by artist and author couple [[Paul Guinan]] and [[Anina Bennett]]. In this history, created for the [[graphic novel]]s ''[[Boilerplate (robot)|Boilerplate]]'' and ''[[Femopolis]]'', Perew creates an electromechanical man, called the 'Automatic Man', in the late 19th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;automaton&quot;&gt;{{cite web

|title=Louis Perew's Automaton
|accessdate=2006-06-01
}}&lt;/ref&gt; (At the time of writing, in February 2007, ''Femopolis'' has not been published.)

In the HBO miniseries, ''Band of Brothers'', [[Easy Company]] soldier [[Warren Muck]] states that he is from Tonawanda and that he swam across the Niagara River. &quot;Skip&quot; Muck died in the [[Battle of Bastogne]] and is on the City of Tonawanda memorial to soldiers killed in [[World War II]].

In the 1999 film, ''Saving Private Ryan'', Private James Ryan is rescued by Tom Hanks' character.  The Ryan character was based upon Sgt. Fritz (Frederick) Niland. Niland lost [[Niland brothers|two brothers]], Robert and Preston in the [[Normandy Landings]]. Edward Niland (a third brother) was listed as killed in action in the Pacific, but was found in a Japanese POW camp at the end of the war. Fritz and Skip Muck were best friends and enlisted in the 101st together in 1942.

In Mark Twain's The Diary of Adam and Eve (circa 1904), and popularized by the musical The Apple Tree, Tonawanda is identified as the site Adam and Eve move to after they are removed from the Garden of Eden (which is identified as &quot;Niagara Falls Park&quot;).

== History ==

What is now known as the city of Salamanca was originally two separate communities, one on the [[Little Valley (town), New York|Little Valley Creek]] and the other on the [[Great Valley, New York|Great Valley Creek]]; the westernmost one of the two was called &quot;Hemlock,&quot; a name derived from the fact that there were numerous hemlock trees throughout the surrounding majestic mountains of the Mighty Ohi:yo'. Hemlock was later renamed &quot;West Salamanca&quot; and (although it was marked on road signs as late as the 1990s) was eventually incorporated into a single city of Salamanca. The city itself was incorporated in 1913.  The majority of the city, with the exception of a northeastern spur along the Great Valley Creek, was constructed on the [[Allegany Indian Reservation]] held by the [[Seneca Nation of New York]], as established in various treaties. Under the nation's policy, non-Seneca residents are barred from owning [[real property]] on the reservation, and non-Senecas can only lease the property from the Seneca Nation.&lt;ref name=zito&gt;Zito, Selena (June 5, 2011). [http://triblive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/opinion/columnists/zito/s_740364.html Smokes cheap, tensions high]. (Also titled &quot;[http://townhall.com/columnists/salenazito/2011/06/05/portrait_of_a_failed_american_city Portrait of a Failed American City].&quot;) ''Pittsburgh Tribune-Review''. Retrieved July 28, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  The previous leases had had only nominal payments. When the leases expired in the early 1990s, and when the nation attempted to raise the cost of the lease, many people living in the city did not agree on the amount of lease payments or the legitimacy of the Senecas' absolute ownership claim, and this caused bitterness, lawsuits, and appeals to government officials. In the end, the new leases were put into effect, and fifteen households were seized and their owners evicted from their homes for refusing to sign the lease.&lt;ref name=bn728&gt;Herbeck, Dan and Kathleen Ronayne (July 28, 2012). [http://www.buffalonews.com/city/article969736.ece Senecas plan to evict Snyder Beach residents]. ''The Buffalo News''. Retrieved July 28, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The current lease is in effect until 2030, with an option to extend until 2070.

Despite the lack of ownership, leased land held by non-Senecas is subject to [[property tax]], which the lessee must pay to the city, Cattaraugus County and the Salamanca City Central School District, whereas Seneca-owned land is exempt under the same treaties. Once a Seneca acquires the land, it is taken off the tax rolls; for this reason, the city of Salamanca does not auction off abandoned properties on the reservation in a property tax auction, for fear that the Senecas will buy the land and take it off the tax rolls.

One of the casualties of the ownership system was the [[Ray Evans Seneca Theater]], which has recently been upgraded into a center for the performing arts focusing on local live theater.

===Casino gambling===
The [[Seneca Nation of Indians]] opened a [[gambling]] [[casino]] in Salamanca in May 2004. About 1,000 new jobs were created by the current casino operation, creating a housing shortage for the influx of workers. The 25% share of the revenue going to the city and county have enabled the city to try to refurbish its worn-down image.{{citation needed|date=January 2010}}

However, noticeable, significant change has not yet occurred in the city, with new construction in only a few select areas. Main Street and US Route 219 (which runs through the city) remains largely untouched with little to no renovation and is populated by cigarette, tobacco, coffee shops, gas stations and empty storefronts. Some have criticized the current trend of developing the &quot;New Salamanca&quot; as a tax free cigarette/gas haven.{{citation needed|date=January 2010}} The Seneca Nation has made efforts to reverse this trend and established an economic development corporation to encourage diversification of the city's businesses in 2011. Furthermore, the casino payments were stopped in late 2010 in a dispute with the state over whether or not it had violated the exclusivity terms of the agreement by opening [[racino]]s elsewhere in Western New York.

The contentious relations between Seneca and non-Seneca residents led columnist Selena Zito to dub the city of Salamanca a &quot;failed American city&quot; in a 2011 column.&lt;ref name=zito/&gt;

==Demographics==

'''Watertown''' is a [[Administrative divisions of New York#City|city]] in the state of [[New York]] and the [[county seat]] of [[Jefferson County, New York|Jefferson County]]. It is situated approximately {{convert|20|mi}} south of the [[Thousand Islands]]. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], it had a population of 27,023, an increase of 1.2% since 2000.  The [[U.S. Army]] post [[Fort Drum]] is near the city.

Named after the many falls located on the [[Black River (New York)|Black River]], the city developed early in the 19th century as a manufacturing center. From years of generating industrial wealth, in the early 20th century the city was said to have more millionaires per capita than any other city in the nation.  Residents of Watertown built a rich public and private architectural legacy. It is the smallest city to have a park designed by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]], the celebrated [[landscape architect]] who created [[Central Park]] in New York City.

Geographically, Watertown is located in the central part of Jefferson County.  It lies {{convert|72|mi}} northeast of [[Syracuse, New York]] and {{convert|31|mi}} south of the [[Ontario]] border. The city is served by [[Watertown International Airport]].

The city is known as the birthplace of the [[Five and dime]], the [[safety pin]], and is the home of [[Little Trees]] air fresheners. It manufactured the first portable [[steam engine]]. It has the longest continually operating county fair in the [[United States]] and holds the Red and Black football franchise, the oldest surviving semi-professional team in the United States.

== History ==
[[Image:Blackriverwatertownny.JPG|250px|thumb|left|The Black River[[File:Prelucrare 3D pentru Watertown (Details) - New York.jpg|250px]]]]
The city of Watertown was settled in 1800 by pioneers from [[New Hampshire]], most notably Hart Massey, Henry Coffeen, and Zachariah Butterfield, part of a large migration into New York from [[New England]] after the [[American Revolutionary War]]. These pioneers chose the area due to the Black River. The pioneers' vision was for an industrial center that would draw power from the Black River. All the land was rough and unclear. Elevation was also a problem. The western end of the town was {{convert|12|to|15|ft}} higher than the eastern end, with a large depression in the middle. A small stream also passed through the town.

Within a few years, the center of town was cleared for the ambitious [[Public Square (Watertown, New York)|Public Square]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.citywatertown.org/index.asp?NID=411 History at Official Web Site]&lt;/ref&gt; Together with the 19th century structures that created a streetscape around it, this has been designated a [[historic district (United States)|historic district]] listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. As industry and businesses flourished, residents built substantial retail buildings, churches and private residences. The [[Paddock Arcade]], built in 1850 according to European and US models, is the oldest continuously operating enclosed mall in the United States. It is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], as are several significant churches and  private mansions.

The drop in the Black River at Watertown's location provided abundant water power for early industry. By the mid-19th century, entrepreneurs had built paper mills and major industries, including the first portable steam engine in 1847. In 1851, the city was joined to the state by the railroad. Other mills rapidly joined the business base and generated revenue to support early public works projects like the water system and illuminating gas works in 1853, and a telephone system in 1879.

Watertown claims that [[Rodman, New York|Rodman]] native [[Frank W. Woolworth]] conceived the idea of his mercantile chain while working there in 1878. Woolworth, employed as a clerk in Moore's Store, set up a successful clearance display of low-priced items. This led to his idea of a store specializing in fixed-price, cut-rate merchandise. Woolworth left Watertown and opened his first store in [[Utica, New York]] in 1879.

Among the many manufacturing businesses was the Davis Sewing Machine Company, which originated in Watertown. It was predecessor to [[George P. Huffman]]'s [[Huffy|Huffy Corporation]] (NYSE: HUF), now an American maker of bicycles and other sporting goods.

In 1805 Watertown became the [[county seat]] of [[Jefferson County, New York]], and it was made an incorporated village in 1816.  In 1869, Watertown was incorporated as a city. In 1920, the city adopted a city manager style of government. The Jefferson County Courthouse Complex is an example of the substantial architecture of the city, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. An early industrial city that earned great wealth for many of its citizens by the turn of the 20th century, Watertown also developed an educated professional class of doctors and lawyers.

A number of factors affected Watertown's progress. The economic center of the country kept moving west, and [[Chicago]] drew off many of its younger people for business and professional opportunities. Industrial technology shifted and jobs changed. In the [[deindustrialization]] of the mid-20th century, Watertown suffered economic and population declines.

The city has been working in recent decades to redevelop its downtown and revive the heart of the city. It is capitalizing on its rich architectural heritage, compact and walkable retail center, and well-designed residential areas.

Today the city serves as the commercial and financial center for a large rural area. It is the major community closest to [[Fort Drum]] and the post's large population. Since the city is located just {{convert|25|mi}} from the international boundary via the [[Thousand Islands Bridge]], shopping by [[Canadian]] visitors is an important part of the local economy.

In 2013, the Watertown City Council made headlines by voting to [http://centralny.ynn.com/content/top_stories/636594/watertown-lawmakers-vote-in-favor-of-limiting-roommates/ make it illegal for residents to have roommates of any sort] - based on a single complaint from one woman. It remains to be seen if future legal battles over the ruling will resolve what is seen by many as a serious over-reach of government into the lives of Watertown citizens.

[[Image:Downtown Watertown.jpg|thumb|350px|Downtown Watertown]]

== Geography ==
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|9.3|sqmi}}. {{convert|9.0|sqmi}} of it is land and {{convert|0.3|sqmi}} of it (3.45%) is water.

The [[Black River (New York)|Black River]] flows westward through the city toward [[Lake Ontario]].  The Black River is a world-renowned [[kayaking]] destination.  Competition-level [[kayaking]] events, such as the Blackwater Challenge, have been held on the river.

By tradition, the city's name was derived from the abundant water power available from the river.  Businesses harnessed water power to create one of the early industrial centers in New York.  Paper mills were historically a major industry for the city and contributed to its 19th-century wealth.

[[Jefferson Community College (New York)|Jefferson Community College]] (JCC) is located in the western part of the city near the fairgrounds.

== Transportation ==

=== Highways===
[[Interstate 81 (New York)|Interstate 81]] runs through the Watertown area. It is a north-south route that runs from near [[Dandridge, Tennessee]] north to [[Leeds and the Thousand Islands|Hill Island, Ontario]], connecting via the [[Thousand Islands Bridge]] and a short [[Ontario Highway 137|connecting road]] to [[Ontario Highway 401|Highway 401]] across the Canadian border. Interstate 81 passes just to the west of the city of Watertown, near [[Salmon Run Mall]].

[[U.S. Route 11]] runs from eastern [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], to its northern terminus at the Canadian border in [[Rouses Point, New York]]. US 11 runs north-south through the city of Watertown.

Many state highways converge on the city. [[New York State Route 3]] is an east-west route that begins in [[Sterling, New York|Sterling]] and heads north and east to Watertown. NY 3 interchanges with I-81 at the city line. NY 3 heads east into Watertown, overlapping with both US 11 and NY 12 through downtown prior to leaving the city to the northeast to head through the [[Adirondacks]] to [[Plattsburgh, New York|Plattsburgh]].

[[New York State Route 12]] is a north-south route through the city, extending northward to [[Clayton (village), New York|Clayton]] then following the [[St. Lawrence Seaway]] to [[Morristown, New York|Morristown]]. A spur, NY 12E, takes a slightly-longer path through [[Cape Vincent (village), New York|Cape Vincent]] before rejoining NY 12.

The station changed its [[call letters]] to [[WWNY-TV]] in 1965.  After an unsuccessful struggle against the [[Federal Communications Commission]] and [[concentration of media ownership|its directive for newspapers to divest themselves of television stations held within the same market]], the ''Daily Times'' sold WWNY-TV to [[United Communications Corporation]] of [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]] in 1981.

In 2001, United Communications entered into an agreement with Smith Broadcasting to operate a [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network affiliate with low power transmitters in Watertown and Massena.

==Watertown in popular culture==
* American writer [[Frederick Exley|Fred Exley]] grew up in Watertown, and the city provides the setting for much of his 1968 novel ''[[A Fan's Notes]]''.
* Watertown was the given setting for the 1990 [[Bette Midler]] film ''[[Stella (1990 film)|Stella]]''. While the movie was filmed in Ontario, several local items were imported to appear in the film, including the local daily newspaper, taxi-cabs and shopping bags from the locally owned Empsall's department store.
* [[Little Trees]] air fresheners were invented in Watertown in 1951; now the city is home to the Car-Freshner Corporation headquarters and manufacturing plant.
* [[Harry Chapin]] made a famous quote—&quot;I spent a week there one afternoon&quot;—about Watertown. His song &quot;[[A Better Place to Be]]&quot; was inspired by a story he heard in Watertown.  Chapin mentioned both the quote and the origin of the song on his 1976 album ''[[Greatest Stories Live]]''.
* [[Frank Sinatra]]'s 1970 concept album ''[[Watertown (album)|Watertown]]'' charts the story of a middle-aged man in Watertown, New York, whose wife has left him with his children.
* In the 2005 film ''[[Robots (film)|Robots]]'', the fictional town of [[Robots (film)#Locations|Rivet Town]] is based on Watertown, where ''Robots'' director [[Chris Wedge]] lived during his teens.
*In the ''[[Law &amp; Order: SVU]]'' episode &quot;Selfish&quot;, there was a mention of Watertown and Evans Mills as a wanted man had escaped to a cabin there. The episode showed much of the surrounding area including areas North where the show chased the criminal to Canada.

'''Yonkers''' is the fourth most populous [[City (New York)|city]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[New York]] (behind [[New York City]], [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], and [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]]), and the most populous city in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]], with a population of 195,976 (according to the 2010 Census). Yonkers borders the New York City borough of [[the Bronx]] and is located two miles (3&amp;nbsp;km) north of [[Manhattan]] at the cities' closest points.

The city is home to several attractions: the [[Hudson River Museum]], the Sherwood House, the [[Science Barge]], [[Cross County Shopping Center]], Ridge Hill Shopping Center, and [[Yonkers Raceway]], a [[harness racing]] track that has renovated its grounds and clubhouse and added legalized [[video slot machine]] [[gambling]] in 2006 in a &quot;[[racino]]&quot; called Empire City. There are also many large shopping areas along Central Park Avenue ([[New York State Route 100|NY 100]]), informally called &quot;Central Ave&quot; by area residents, a name it takes officially a few miles north in [[White Plains, New York|White Plains]].

==History==
[[File:Philipse Manor Hall.jpg|frame|left|[[Philipse Manor Hall]]]]

The land on which the city is built was once part of a 24,000 acre (97&amp;nbsp;km²) land grant called [[Colen Donck]] that ran from the current Manhattan/Bronx border at [[Marble Hill, Manhattan, New York|Marble Hill]] northwards for {{convert|12|mi|0|abbr=off}}, and from the [[Hudson River]] eastwards to the [[Bronx River]]. This grant was purchased in July 1645 by [[Adriaen van der Donck]], a lawyer, scholar, and author who had emerged as a leader of the [[New Netherland]] colony.  Van der Donck was known locally as the ''[[Jonkheer]]'' or ''Jonker'' (etymologically, &quot;young gentleman,&quot; derivation of old Dutch ''jong'' (''young'') and ''heer'' (&quot;lord&quot;); in effect, &quot;[[Esquire]]&quot;), a word from which the name &quot;Yonkers&quot; is directly derived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Erik says: |url=http://www.thirteen.org/dutchny/interactives/dutch-place-names-in-new-york-city/6/ |title=Interactive Map: Dutch Place Names in New York &amp;#124; Dutch New York |publisher=Thirteen.org |date=2009-08-19 |accessdate=2011-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Van der Donck built a [[Sawmill|saw mill]] near where the Nepperhan Creek met the Hudson; the Nepperhan is now also known as the [[Saw Mill River]].  Van der Donck and his family were killed in the [[Peach Tree War]].

Near the site of van der Donck's mill is [[Philipse Manor Hall]], a Colonial-era manor house which today serves as a museum and archive, offering many glimpses into life before the American Revolution. The original structure (later enlarged) was built around 1682 by [[Frederick Philipse]] and his wife Margaret Hardenbroeck. Frederick was a wealthy Dutchman who by the time of his death had amassed an enormous estate, which encompassed the entire modern City of Yonkers, as well as several other Hudson River towns. Philipse's great-grandson, [[Frederick Philipse III]], was a prominent [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] during the [[American Revolution]], who, because of his political leanings, was forced to flee to England. All the lands that belonged to the Philipse family were confiscated and sold.

For its first two hundred years, Yonkers was a small farming town with an active industrial waterfront. Yonkers's later growth rested largely on developing industry. In 1853, [[Elisha Otis]] invented the first safety elevator and the [[Otis Elevator Company]], opened the first elevator factory in the world on the banks of the Hudson near what is now Vark Street. It relocated to larger quarters (now the Yonkers Public Library) in the 1880s. Around the same time, the [[Alexander Smith Carpet Mills Historic District|Alexander Smith and Sons Carpet Company]] (in the Saw Mill River Valley) expanded to 45 buildings, 800 looms, and over 4,000 workers and was known as one of the premier carpet producing centers in the world. In 1892, Smith carpets were sent to Moscow for the tsar's coronation.

In 1894, the voters of Yonkers were able to take part, along with the voters of Kings, Queens and Richmond Counties, in a referendum to determine if they wanted to become part of a &quot;Greater New York City&quot;.  While the results were positive elsewhere, the returns were so negative in Yonkers and [[Mount Vernon, New York|Mount Vernon]] that those two areas were not included in the consolidated city, and remained independent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite inside}}, p.177-78&lt;/ref&gt; Still, some residents call the city &quot;the sixth borough&quot; referring to its location on the New York City border, its urban character and the failed merger vote. A subway connection was planned between Getty Square and the New York City subway line, but when Yonkers residents voted against the incorporation, the project was abandoned.

[[Bakelite]], the first completely synthetic plastic, was invented in Yonkers circa 1906 by Leo Baekeland, and manufactured there until the late 1920s.  Today, two of the former [[Alexander Smith Carpet Mills Historic District|Alexander Smith and Sons Carpet Company]] loft buildings located at 540 and 578 Nepperhan Avenue have been repurposed to house the [[YoHo Artist Community]], a collective group of talented artists that works out of private studios there.&lt;ref&gt;Fallon, Bill (March 3, 2008). “Industrial Arts: Carpet Mills Become Studio Central.” ''Westchester County Business Journal'', p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dignitaries at the Yonkers Saint Patrick's Parade.JPG|thumb|left|Dignitaries at the 2005 Yonkers Saint Patrick's Day Parade]]
The community was incorporated as a village in the northern part of the Town of Yonkers in 1854, and as a city in 1872. The southern part of the Township became part of [[The Bronx]]. The city declined to join the [[City of Greater New York]],and  plans were dropped to extend the [[History of the IRT subway before 1918|new subway]] to Getty Square.  Aside from being a manufacturing center, Yonkers also played a key role in the development of entertainment in the United States. In 1888, Scottish-born John Reid founded the first [[golf course]], with just three holes, in the United States, St. Andrew's Golf Club, in Yonkers.

Early in the 20th Century, Yonkers also hosted a [[brass era]] [[automobile]] maker, [[Colt Runabout Company]];&lt;ref&gt;No apparent relation to [[Colt's Patent Firearms]]. Clymer, Floyd. ''Treasury of Early American Automobiles, 1877-1925'' (New York: Bonanza Books, 1950), p.63.&lt;/ref&gt; despite the car's seemingly glowing performance, the company went under.

Yonkers was also the headquarters of the Waring Hat Company, at the time the nation's largest hat manufacturer. [[World War II]] saw the city's factories manufacture such items as tents and blankets in the Alexander Smith and Sons Carpet Factory and tanks in the Otis Elevator factory.

After [[World War II]], however, with increased competition from less expensive imports, Yonkers lost much of its manufacturing activity. The Alexander Smith Carpet mill fell on hard times and ceased operation on June 24, 1954. In 1983, the Otis Elevator Factory finally closed its doors. With the loss of jobs in the city itself, Yonkers (predominantly the east side) became primarily a residential city and some neighborhoods of the city, such as [[Crestwood, Yonkers, New York|Crestwood]], became popular with wealthy New Yorkers wishing to live outside the city but not in an entirely suburban environment. Yonkers' excellent transportation infrastructure, including three commuter railroad lines (now two, the Harlem and Hudson Lines) and five parkways and thruways, as well as its 15-minute drive from Manhattan and picturesque &quot;period&quot; homes and apartments, made it a desirable city in which to live. Yonkers' manufacturing sector has recently shown a resurgence. A [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries Rolling Stock Company|Kawasaki]] railroad cars assembly plant opened in 1986 in the former Otis plant, producing the new [[R142A (New York City Subway car)|R142A]], [[R143 (New York City Subway car)|R143]] and  [[R160B (New York City Subway car)|R160B]] cars for the [[New York City Subway]], and the PA4 and upcoming PA5 series for [[Port Authority Trans-Hudson|PATH]].

On January 4, 1940, Yonkers resident [[Edwin Howard Armstrong]] transmitted the first [[FM broadcasting|FM]] radio broadcast (on station [[W2XCR]]) from the Yonkers home of C.R. Runyon, a co-experimenter. Yonkers also had the longest running [[pirate radio]] station, owned by [[Allan Weiner]] during the 1970s through the 1980s.

In 1960, the Census Bureau reported Yonkers's population as 95.8% white and 4.0% black.&lt;ref name=&quot;census1&quot;/&gt; The city's struggles with racial discrimination and segregation were highlighted in a decades-long federal lawsuit. After a 1985 decision and an unsuccessful appeal, Yonkers' schools were integrated in 1988. The federal judge, [[Leonard B. Sand]], ruled that Yonkers had engaged in institutional segregation in housing and school policies for over 40 years and tied the illegal concentration of public housing and private housing discrimination to the city's resistance to ending racial isolation in its public schools.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

[[File:Yonkers Main Library.jpg|thumb|left|Yonkers Public Library]]
Yonkers moved to the center of national/international attention during the summer of 1988, when the city was found in contempt of the federal courts, after it refused to build promised municipal public housing in the eastern portions of the city. It had earlier agreed to do so in a consent decree, after losing the appeal in 1987. Being fined one dollar, doubling every day until the council passed the ordinance set out in the consent decree, Yonkers remained in contempt of the courts until September 9, 1988. On that date, the City Council relented, in the wake of library closures, sanitation cutbacks, while looking at massive city layoffs, which would have been required to continue its resistance to desegregation.

In the 1980s and 1990s, Yonkers developed a national reputation for racial tension, based on a long-term battle between the City of Yonkers and the [[NAACP]] over the building of subsidized low-rent housing. The City wanted to use federal funds to create or expand high-rise housing projects in southwest Yonkers; other groups, led by the NAACP, felt that concentrating subsidized housing in traditionally poor neighborhoods perpetuated poverty. The climax of the battle came when [[United States district court]] Judge Leonard Sand imposed a fine on Yonkers which started at $1 and doubled every day until the City capitulated to the federally mandated plan.

Mayor [[Nicholas Wasicsko]], in his first term, fought to save the city from financial disaster and bring about unity. He was a lonely figure in city politics at the time, which was scarred with the stigma of the &quot;Balkanization of Yonkers.&quot; He succeeded in helping to end the city's contempt of the courts, but was voted out of office as a result. Yonkers still suffers the stigma of having bitterly opposed desegregation.

The Irish-American community is prominent in Yonkers, and the city hosts one of the nation's oldest [[St. Patrick's Day]] parades. There is also home to a large [[Italian-American]] community, and the city hosts a large [[Columbus Day]] festival with a ''Miss Italian-American'' pageant.Yonkers also has a significant [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] population.

Another large community is the [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] community. In the early and mid 20th Century a large amount of people emigrated from [[Poland]], [[Ukraine]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Russia]], and [[Croatia]]. Recently a large number of immigrants from the former [[Yugoslavia]] have called Yonkers home. The Slavic community is centered around St. Casimir's Roman Catholic Church, Most Holy Trinity Roman Catholic Church, Holy Trinity Russian Orthodox Church, and St. Michael's Ukrainian Catholic Church. Yonkers still has a large Slavic community. The city also has a &quot;stanytsia&quot; (branch) of [[Plast]]. Yonkers also has a large [[Arab American|Arab]] population, coinciding with the high percentage of Arab speakers in Yonkers. Most of these Arabs come from [[The Levant]], from mainly the countries of [[Jordan]], [[Palestine]], and [[Lebanon]], and are of the Christian faith. The Arabic community specifically Jordanian currently has three churches in the city, Virgin Mary Orthodox Church, St Mary's Roman Catholic Church, and Christ the Savior Melkite Church. The community settled in Yonkers in the late 1940s and has since continued a steady growth.

There also once was a significant [[Jewish]] population (the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] plays ''[[Hello, Dolly! (musical)|Hello Dolly!]]'' and ''[[Lost in Yonkers]]'' both take place within the Yonkers Jewish community). However, it has dwindled. In the 2000s, some areas bordering similar neighborhoods in [[Riverdale, Bronx|Riverdale]] began seeing an influx of [[Orthodox Jew]]s. Subsequently, Riverdale [[Hatzalah]] Volunteer Ambulance Service began serving some neighborhoods in the southwest section of the city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.riverdalehatzalah.org/ Riverdale Hatzalah]&lt;/ref&gt;  There is also a small Jewish Cemetery, the [[Sherwood Park Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://test.histopolis.com/Place/US/NY/Westchester_County/Sherwood_Park_Cemetery |title=Sherwood Park Cemetery, Yonkers, Westchester County, New York, United States - Nearby Cities, Nearby Cemeteries and Genealogy Resources - Histopolis |publisher=Test.histopolis.com |date=2012-11-21 |accessdate=2013-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
The city is spread out over hills rising from near sea level at the eastern bank of the [[Hudson River]] to 416 feet (126 m) at Sacred Heart Church, whose spire can be seen from [[Long Island]], [[New York City]], and [[New Jersey]].

The city occupies 20.3&amp;nbsp;square miles (52.6&amp;nbsp;km²), including 18.1 square miles (46.8&amp;nbsp;km²) of land and 2.2 square miles (5.8&amp;nbsp;km²) (11.02%) of water, according to the [[United States Census Bureau]].
The [[Bronx River]] separates Yonkers from [[Mount Vernon, New York|Mount Vernon]], [[Tuckahoe (village), New York|Tuckahoe]], [[Eastchester, New York|Eastchester]], [[Bronxville]], and [[Scarsdale]] to the east. The town of [[Greenburgh, New York|Greenburgh]] is to the north, and on the western border is the [[Hudson River]].

On the south, Yonkers borders the [[Riverdale, Bronx|Riverdale]], [[Woodlawn, Bronx|Woodlawn]], and [[Wakefield, Bronx|Wakefield]] sections of [[The Bronx]]. In addition, the southernmost point of Yonkers is only {{convert|2|mi|0|abbr=off}} north of the northernmost point of [[Manhattan]] when measured from Broadway &amp; Caryl Avenue in Yonkers to Broadway &amp; West 228th Street in the [[Marble Hill, Manhattan|Marble Hill]] section of Manhattan.

The [[gentilic]] for residents is alternately Yonkersonian or Yonkersite.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wordsmith.org/chat/dickson.html Paul Dickson (Wordsmith.org)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===
Yonkers has cold [[winter]]s and warm summers.  Temperature ranges average lows of 27 degrees F in January, and average highs of 84 degrees F in July.

==Neighborhoods==
Though Yonkers contains many small residential enclaves and communities, it can conveniently be divided into four quarters, demarcated by the Saw Mill River. There are 37 or more distinct neighborhoods, many of these names being rarely used except by real estate agents.

===Northeast Yonkers===

Northeast Yonkers is a primarily [[Irish-American]] and [[Italian-American]] area. Though suburban, it is noticeably less so than the [[Greenburgh|Town of Greenburgh]] to the north. House sizes vary widely, from small houses set close together, to some larger houses in areas like Lawrence Park West. Tuckahoe Road, which intersects Central Avenue ([[NY 100]]), contains many stores as well. Notable former residents include [[Steven Tyler]] (born Steven Tallarico) of the rock band [[Aerosmith]], whose childhood home was just off Central Avenue on Pembrook Drive. Northeastern Yonkers contains the desirable [[Crestwood, Yonkers, New York|Crestwood]], Colonial Heights, Cedar Knolls, and Beech Hill sections of the city, as well as several other wealthy enclaves such as Lawrence Park West. Landmarks include [[Saint Vladimir’s Orthodox Theological Seminary|St Vladimir's Seminary]], as well as [[Sarah Lawrence College]], and the Tanglewood Shopping Center (one-time home of the [[The Tanglewood Boys]] gang). The northeast section of Yonkers consists of more upscale housing than the rest of the city, and, due to the proximity of several [[Metro-North]] commuter railroad stations, its residents tend to be employed in corporate positions in [[Manhattan]].

===Northwest Yonkers===
Northwest Yonkers is a collection of widely varying neighborhoods, spanning from the [[Hudson River]] to around the [[New York State Thruway]]/I-87 and from Ashburton Avenue north to the [[Hastings-on-Hudson, New York|Hastings-on-Hudson]] border. With the Hudson River bordering it to the west, this area has many beautiful [[Victorian architecture|Victorian-era homes]] with panoramic views of [[New Jersey Palisades|the Palisades]]. An interest in historic preservation has taken hold in this neighborhood in recent years, as demonstrated on streets like Shonnard Terrace, Delavan Terrace and Hudson Terrace. The population of northwestern Yonkers is probably the most ethnically diverse in the city.

Landmarks include the [[Hudson River Museum]], [[Untermyer Park]] and the Lenoir Nature Preserve. The significant amount of surviving Victorian architecture and 19th century estates in northwest Yonkers has attracted many filmmakers in recent years.

The two block section of Palisade Ave between Chase and Roberts Ave in northwest Yonkers is colloquially known as &quot;the north end&quot; or &quot;the end&quot;. It was and still is the only retail and food shopping area in the neighborhood, and was well known by the local kids for an original soda fountain store, &quot;Urich's&quot; and Robbins Pharmacy. It was once the end of the # 2 trolley line. The # 2 bus replaced the trolley line. One part of Yonkers that is sometimes overlooked is Nepera Park. This is a small section at the northern part of Nepperhan Avenue on the Hastings-on-Hudson border.  Nepperhan Avenue in Nepera Park has a large A &amp; P Supermarket, Walgreens, KFC, and several smaller stores, such as a  bakery, deli, dry cleaners, a few beauty salons, and so on.

===Southeast Yonkers===
Southeast Yonkers is mostly Irish-American (many of the Irish being native born) and Italian-American. Many of the businesses and type of architecture in southeast Yonkers bear a greater resemblance to certain parts of [[the Bronx]], [[Brooklyn]], [[Queens]], or [[Staten Island]] than to points north. This is not surprising as southeastern Yonkers is largely within walking distance of the [[Riverdale, Bronx|Riverdale]], [[Woodlawn, Bronx, New York|Woodlawn]], and [[Wakefield, Bronx, New York|Wakefield]] sections of the Bronx. Many residents regard eastern McLean Avenue, home to a vibrant Irish community shared with the Woodlawn section of the Bronx, to be the true hub of Yonkers.

Similarly, a portion of Midland Avenue in the [[Dunwoodie, Yonkers, New York|Dunwoodie]] section has been called the &quot;Little Italy&quot; of Yonkers. Landmarks of southeastern Yonkers include the [[Cross County Shopping Center]], Yonkers Raceway, and [[St. Joseph's Seminary, Dunwoodie|St. Joseph's Seminary]] in the Dunwoodie neighborhood, which was visited by [[Pope John Paul II]] in October 1995 and later by [[Pope Benedict XVI]] in April 2008.

===Southwest Yonkers===
This area in Yonkers has suffered from past economic, political, and social challenges. Early in the 21st century a decrease in crime rate and a juxtaposition of poverty and revitalization mirrored newly [[gentrification|gentrified]] neighborhoods of New York City's [[Harlem]] and Brooklyn. Off South Broadway (a major thoroughfare) one can find residential neighborhoods, such as Nodine Hill, [[Park Hill, Yonkers|Park Hill]], and Hudson Park (off the Hudson River) with residential streets of turn-of-the-century mansions, and upscale luxury rentals and condominiums. Other upscale neighborhoods are Ludlow Park, Hudson Park &amp; Van Cortlandt Crest, off Riverdale Avenue, right over the [[Riverdale, Bronx|Riverdale]] border - the former alongside the [[Hudson River]].

The area is also home to significant historical and educational institutions including the historic [[Philipse Manor Hall State Historic Site|Philipse Manor Hall]] (a New York State Historic Site that houses one of three papier mache ceilings in the United States), The [[Science Barge]], [http://www.beczak.org/ Beczak Environmental Education Center], and a 2003 [[Yonkers Public Library]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ypl.org/hoursanddirec.htm#RIV |title=Welcome to the Yonkers Public Library!-Hours and Directions |publisher=Ypl.org |date=2008-12-07 |accessdate=2009-05-06 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080729014156/http://www.ypl.org/hoursanddirec.htm#RIV |archivedate = July 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many southwesterners are of [[African American|African]], [[Caribbean]], Italian, or [[Hispanic]] descent while an influx those from other cultural backgrounds has continued to shape a culturally diverse community. Some neighborhoods right on the [[Riverdale, Bronx|Riverdale]] border are increasingly becoming home to [[Orthodox Jew]]s. The revitalization of the downtown Yonkers/[[Getty Square]] area has helped to nurture growth for Southwest Yonkers.

In the early 2000s several new luxury apartment buildings were built along the Hudson. There is also a new &quot;Sculpture Meadow on the Hudson,&quot; renovation of a Victorian-era pier, and a new public library housed in the remodeled Otis elevator factory. [[Peter X. Kelly|Peter Kelly]]'s award-winning fine dining restaurant X&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;0 - Xaviars on Hudson is located at the renovated pier with much success.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Liz (3 Feb 2010).

==Government==
Yonkers is typically a Democratic stronghold just like the rest of [[Westchester County]] and most of [[New York]] state, but until recently it has had a small democratic lean. In 1992, Yonkers voted for [[George H. W. Bush]] over [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Ross Perot]] for president, but has voted solidly Democratic ever since.  At a local level, recent mayors of Yonkers have included Republicans [[Phil Amicone]] and [[John Spencer (politician)|John Spencer]], while the [[Yonkers City Council]] was also mostly controlled by Republicans until recently when the Democrats took over the council again. The current mayor is Democrat Mike Spano. In the State Assembly, Yonkers is represented by Democrats [[J. Gary Pretlow]] and Shelley Mayer, and in the [[New York State Senate]], by Democrats [[Andrea Stewart-Cousins]] and [[Jeffrey Klein]]. At the federal level, Democrats hold both congressional districts that include parts of Yonkers, with representatives [[Eliot Engel]] and [[Nita Lowey]] holding the seats as of 2011.

Yonkers is governed via a mayor-council system. The council consists of six members each elected from one of six districts. The mayor and city council president are elected in a citywide vote.

These include [[Wakefield (Metro-North station)|Wakefield]], [[Mount Vernon West (Metro-North station)|Mt. Vernon West]], [[Fleetwood (Metro-North station)|Fleetwood]], [[Bronxville (Metro-North station)|Bronxville]], [[Tuckahoe (Metro-North station)|Tuckahoe]] and [[Crestwood train station|Crestwood]].

It runs north-south in Yonkers from the [[Hastings-on-Hudson]] border in the north to the Bronx border in the south at [[Van Cortlandt Park]].

The historic [[Croton Aqueduct]] tunnel has a hard-packed dirt trail running above it for most of its length in Yonkers, with a few on-street routes near [[Getty Square]].

'''Lockport''' is a [[Administrative divisions of New York#City|city]] in [[Niagara County, New York]], [[United States]]. The population was 21,165 at the 2010 census. The name is derived from a set of [[Erie canal]] [[Canal lock|locks]] within the city. Lockport is the [[county seat]] of Niagara County and is surrounded by the [[Administrative divisions of New York#Town|town]] of [[Lockport (town), New York|Lockport]]. It is part of the [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]&amp;ndash;[[Niagara Falls, New York|Niagara Falls]] [[Buffalo-Niagara Falls metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]].

== History ==
[[File:Lockport bartlett color.jpg|thumb|left|Lockport 1839, by [[William Henry Bartlett]]]]

The construction of the [[Erie Canal]] was authorized by the New York State Legislature in April 1816. The route proposed by surveyors was to traverse an area in central [[Niagara County, New York]], which was then &quot;uncivilized&quot; and free of White settlers. At the time, the nearest settlers were located in nearby [[Cold Springs, Buffalo, New York|Cold Springs, New York]]. As it became known where the proposed [[canal]] was to be built, land [[speculators]] began to buy large plots along and near the proposed route of the canal. By December 1820, when the exact location of the step locks had been determined, the whole area of what would eventually become Lockport was owned by only fifteen men, many of whom were [[Quakers]].

The canal reached Lockport in 1824, but the locks were not completed until 1825. By 1829, Lockport had become an established [[Administrative divisions of New York#Village|village]]. The community was centered on the locks, and consisted mainly of immigrant [[Scotland|Scottish]] and [[Ireland|Irish]] canal workers, brought in as labor. The workers remained in Lockport after the completion of the locks, giving the city a heavy [[Celt]]ic influence still discernible today, especially in the neighborhoods of Lowertown and North Lockport.

The city of Lockport was officially incorporated in 1865.

The Erie Canal was supplanted by the larger [[New York State Barge Canal]] in 1918, and the famous south &quot;flight of five&quot; locks was replaced by two much larger locks E34 and E35. The north &quot;flight of five&quot; lock chambers still remains as a spill way.

In recent years public officials and private businesses have made an effort to incorporate Lockport history into regional if not a national tourist attraction. This includes the completion of the Canal Discovery Center, The Lockport Cave and Underground Boat Ride tour, and The Lockport Locks and Erie Canal Cruises. Currently, local officials are seeking state grants to reconstruct the historic &quot;flight of five&quot; and make it a living history site complete with boat rides and reenactors. Published reports state that a living history site in Lockport marketed as a day trip from Niagara Falls could draw thousands to Lockport yearly.

The city has a number of properties on the [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Niagara County, New York|National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nris&quot;&gt;{{NRISref|2008a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lockport's largest employer is General Motors Components, the former [[Harrison Radiator Corporation]], which was founded locally in 1912 and which became a division of General Motors Corporation in 1918. Following 10 years of ownership by Delphi Corporation as Delphi Thermal Systems, it returned to General Motors in October 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lockportjournal.com/local/local_story_280015727.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948, the Lockport Chief of Police denied a permit for a [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] minister to preach in a public park using a [[sound truck]].  In ''[[Saia v. New York]]'', the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the city ordinance as a violation of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].

On Friday, June 28, 2013 Lockport had a flash flood.  A storm sat over the city and deposited over 5 inches of rain.  The majority of that 5 inches fell in a 1 hour period during the afternoon.  Low lying areas and many streets flooded.  Mayor Michael Tucker enacted a driving ban.  On Tuesday, July 2nd Governor Andrew Cuomo declared Niagara County a disaster zone as a result of the flooding.  Lieutenant Governor Robert Duffy and U.S. Senator Chuck Schumer toured the City of Lockport to survey the estimated $7 million in damage.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wivb.com/dpp/news/local/cuomo-declares-disaster-in-lockport&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
[[Image:ErieCanalRRBridge04 1A.jpg|thumb|250px|The current double lift Lockport Lock is left in the distance with the northern &quot;Flight of Five&quot; to its right. St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church is in the background. The [[Falls Road Railroad]] runs above.]]

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 8.6&amp;nbsp;square miles (22.4&amp;nbsp;km²), of which, 8.5&amp;nbsp;square miles (22.1&amp;nbsp;km²) of it is land and 0.1&amp;nbsp;square miles (0.3&amp;nbsp;km²) of it (1.39%) is water.

The Erie Canal passes through the center of the city, turning south toward [[Tonawanda Creek]]. It climbs the [[Niagara Escarpment]] through a series of two modern locks. Originally, a double set of five combined smaller locks were used.

[[Image:Flight of five at Lockport.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Original northern five step lock structure crossing the [[Niagara Escarpment]] at Lockport, now ''without gates'' and used as a cascade for excess water. Double {{convert|24+1/2|ft|m|adj=mid|-high}}, {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} modern locks are to the left which replaced the original southern &quot;Flight of Five&quot; lock structure]]

Lockport is at the junction of several major truck roads, including [[New York State Route 78|NY Route 78]] (Transit Road), [[New York State Route 31|NY Route 31]], [[New York State Route 77|NY Route 77]] and [[New York State Route 93|NY Route 93]]. It is 17 miles north of [[Interstate 90 in New York|Interstate 90]] via [[New York State Route 78|NY Route 78]] (Transit Rd.).

Lockport lies in the 716 [[Area Code]].

'''Hudson''' is a [[Administrative divisions of New York#City|city]] located along the west border of [[Columbia County, New York|Columbia County]], [[New York]], [[United States]]. The city is named after the adjacent [[Hudson River]] and ultimately after the explorer [[Henry Hudson]].{{GR|6}}

Hudson is the [[county seat]] of [[Columbia County, New York|Columbia County]]. Hudson is paired with Pallisa, [[Uganda]], as a sister city.

==Geography==
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 6.0 km² (2.3 sq mi). 2.2 square miles (5.6&amp;nbsp;km²) of it is land and 0.2 square miles (0.4&amp;nbsp;km²) of it (6.47%) is water.

Hudson is located on what began as a spit of land jutting into the Hudson River between the South Bay and North Bay, now both a largely turned landfill.

Across the Hudson River lies the town of [[Athens (town), New York|Athens]] and [[Greene County, New York]]; a ferry connected the two municipalities during much of the 19th century. Between them lies Middle Ground Flats, a former sandbar that grew due to both natural silting and also from dumping the spoils of dredging; today it is inhabited by deer and a few occupants of quasi-legal summer shanties.

}}

As of the [[census]]{{GR|2}} of 2010, there were 6,713 people, 2,911 households, and 1,390 families residing in the city. The population was 6,713 at the 2000 census, and has since been estimated at 7,296 [http://www.epodunk.com/cgi-bin/genInfo.php?locIndex=891] in 2003, and at
6,985 [http://www.city-data.com/city/Hudson-New-York.html] in 2006, and at 6,713 at the 2010 census. These numbers include the approximately 500 residents of the local Hudson Correctional Facility. Recent population declines may be attributable to real estate trends in which retirees, young couples, childless couples, singles and weekenders have been gradually replacing larger families and converting apartment buildings to single-family homes, as the number of unoccupied homes and tax delinquency has declined.

The [[population density]] was 3,468.2 inhabitants per square mile (1,338.7/km²). There were 2,911 housing units at an average density of 1,542.8 per square mile (595.5/km²). The racial makeup of the city was 60.29 (49% Non-Hispanic) [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 28.02% [[African American (U.S. Census)|African American]], 0.28% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 2.84% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], 0.01% [[Pacific Islander (U.S. Census)|Pacific Islander]],and 4.41% from two or more races. [[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]] of any race were 16.41% of the population.

There were 2,951 households out of which 28.6% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 29.4% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 19.6% had a female householder with no husband present, and 46.1% were non-families. 39.0% of all households were made up of individuals and 15.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.26 and the average family size was 3.00.

In the city the population was spread out with 23.7% under the age of 18, 9.4% from 18 to 24, 30.0% from 25 to 44, 21.0% from 45 to 64, and 16.0% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 37 years. For every 100 females there were 106.7 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 105.6 males.

The median income for a household in the city was $24,279, and the median income for a family was $27,594. Males had a median income of $26,274 versus $22,598 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the city was $15,759. About 23.8% of families and 25.6% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 37.7% of those under age 18 and 13.9% of those age 65 or over.

==History==
{{ref improve section|date=October 2010}}
The land was purchased from native [[Mahicans]] by [[Dutch People|Dutch]] settlers in 1662 and was originally part of [[Claverack, New York|Town of Claverack]]; formerly it was known as &quot;Claverack Landing&quot;. Settled by [[New England]] [[whaling|whalers]] and merchants hailing primarily from [[Nantucket]], [[Martha's Vineyard]], and [[Providence, Rhode Island]], Hudson was chartered as a city in 1785. The self-described &quot;Proprietors&quot; laid out a city grid, and Hudson grew rapidly as an active port, coming within one vote of being named the capital of [[New York State]].

The city grew rapidly and by 1790 was the 24th largest city in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0027/tab02.txt&lt;/ref&gt; As late as 1820, it was the fourth largest city in New York State.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.census.gov/population/documentation/twps0027/tab05.txt&lt;/ref&gt; Martin Van Buren opened his first law office in Hudson. Margaret B. Schram's &quot;Hudson's Merchants and Whalers: 1783-1850&quot; tells the story of the city's maritime history. On March 1, 1794, General [[William Jenkins Worth]], the future liberator of [[Texas]] in the [[Mexican-American War]], was born on Union Street in Hudson. The house where he was born still stands. Worth Avenue in the city is named after him, as is [[Fort Worth, Texas]]. [[Sanford Robinson Gifford]], a member of the second generation of [[Hudson River School]] of landscape painters, was born in Hudson on July 10, 1823, and following his death on August 29, 1880, was buried in Hudson's Cedar Park Cemetery. Hudson obtained a new charter in 1895. In 1935, to celebrate the [[sesquicentennial]] of the city, the [[United States Mint]] issued the Hudson Half Dollar. The coin is one of the rarest ever minted by the United States Government with only 10,008 coins struck. On the front of the coin is [[Henry Hudson]]'s ship the [[Halve Maen|Half Moon]] and on the reverse is the seal of the city. Local legend has it that coin was minted on the direct order of President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] to thank the Hudson City Democratic Committee for being the first to endorse him for State Senator and Governor.

In the late 19th and first half of the 20th century, Hudson became notorious as a center of vice, especially gambling and [[prostitution]], as described in Bruce Edward Hall's book, ''Diamond Street: The Story of the Little Town with the Big Red Light District''. (The former Diamond Street is today Columbia Street.) At the peak of the vice industry, Hudson also boasted of more than 50 bars. These rackets were mostly broken up in 1951 after surprise raids of Hudson [[whorehouse]]s by [[New York State Troopers]] under orders from then-Governor [[Thomas E. Dewey]] netted, among other catches, several local policemen.

After a steep decline in the 60s and 70s, the city has undergone a significant revival. A group of antiques dealers opened shops on the city's main thoroughfare, Warren Street, in the mid-1980s, the  earliest being the Hudson Antiques Center, founded by Alain Pioton, and The English Antiques Center. Their numbers grew from a handful in the 1980s to almost seventy shops now, represented by the Hudson Antiques Dealers Association (HADA). Following this business revival, the city experienced a residential revival as well, and is now known for its active arts scene, antiques shops, restaurants, art galleries and nightlife.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Gene. &quot;[http://americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2004/2/2004_2_58.shtml America on the Hudson]&quot; ''[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]]'', April/May 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last few years, perhaps encouraged by the number of [[gay]] business owners among the original antiques dealers, Hudson has become a destination for gay people who have opened new businesses, moved here from larger urban areas, and who have been in the forefront of the restoration of many of the city's historic houses.  In 2010, Hudson hosted its first gay pride parade, which was attended by several hundred people.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fox23news.com/news/local/story/Hudson-pride-parade/_35iFvFf8kO8bP7E6DzhTA.cspx&lt;/ref&gt;

With hundreds of properties listed or eligible to be listed in the State and [[National Register of Historic Places|National]] Registers of historic places, Hudson has been called &quot;a finest dictionary of American architecture in New York State.&quot; The vast majority of properties in the Register-listed [[Hudson Historic District (New York)|Hudson Historic District]] are considered [[contributing property|contributing]]. A discussion of Hudson's architecture, its history, and recent revival, together with a collection of 200 period photographs of the city spanning the mid-19th to the early 20th century, is ''Historic Hudson: An Architectural Portrait'' by historian Byrne Fone.

In the 1990s and early 21st century, Hudson has had five mayors: William Allen, Dolly Allen, Richard Scalera, Kenneth Cranna and Richard Tracy. During that time Scalera has been elected Mayor seven times, but declined to run twice. This period has been marked by unusual levels of friction between elected officials and residents as the demographics and economics of the city have shifted. 

This was followed from late 1998 until spring 2005 by a land use conflict between St. Lawrence Cement (SLC), a subsidiary of what was then one of the world's largest cement companies, the Swiss multinational giant Holderbank (since renamed [[Holcim]]), and private citizens. The company proposed a massive, coal-fired cement manufacturing project sprawling over {{convert|1800|acre|km2}} in the city of Hudson and the town of Greenport, Columbia County, New York. Sustained grassroots opposition &lt;ref name=&quot;FOH&quot;&gt;[http://www.stoptheplant.com Detailed chronology of cement plant controversy at stoptheplant.com]&lt;/ref&gt; to the project was spearheaded by business owner Peter Jung&lt;ref name=&quot;Jung&quot;&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/independentlens/twosquaremiles/people.html Public Broadcasting System] (PBS): &quot;Jung co-founded Friends of Hudson and served as president of the organization throughout most of its six-year battle with St. Lawrence Cement.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and journalist Sam Pratt,&lt;ref name=&quot;Pratt&quot;&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/independentlens/twosquaremiles/people.html Public Broadcasting System] (PBS): &quot;Pratt is the devoted co-founder and executive director of Friends of Hudson, the grassroots organization that has helped score a series of against-the-odds environmental and political victories in the Hudson Valley, including the fight against the St. Lawrence Cement plant proposal.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Independent&quot;&gt;[http://www.zwire.com/site/index.cfm?newsid=14397018&amp;BRD=248&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=462341&amp;rfi=8 The Independent newspaper] (Hillsdale, NY): &quot;Opposition leader Sam Pratt, executive director of Friends of Hudson, welcomed the decision.&quot; NOTE: Newspaper is now defunct, but this article is archived at [http://hudson.typepad.com/stp/files/inde042205.pdf StopThePlant.com] &lt;/ref&gt; co-founders of Friends of Hudson (FOH). The controversy garnered national attention from news outlets such as CNN and The New York Times, as well as media outlets in Canada and Switzerland. The project was withdrawn after Secretary of State [[Randy Daniels]] determined that the company's plans were inconsistent with the State's 24 Coastal policies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Business Review|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/albany/stories/2005/04/25/story5.html|title=Secretary of state rejects St. Lawrence Cement plant on Hudson|date=April 25, 2005|publisher=[[American City Business Journals]]|accessdate=2011-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; an outcome which opponents described as &quot;a colossal relief&quot; and supporters denounced as &quot;flawed in its logic&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Council Sharply Criticizes The Pataki Administration's Decision On The Proposed St. Lawrence Cement Plant|url=http://www.bcnys.org/whatsnew/2005/0421cement.htm|date=April 21, 2005|publisher=The Business Council of New York State|author=BCNYS|accessdate=2011-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly 14,000 public comments were received by the State's Division of Coastal Resources (87% of them opposed to the project), a record for that agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.friendsofhudson.com/news/87-commenters-oppose-cement-plant|title=87% Of Commenters Oppose Cement Plant|author=Friends of Hudson|publisher=Friends Of Hudson|date=March 28, 2005|accessdate=2011-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Syracuse''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɪr|ə|k|juː|s}} or {{IPAc-en|local|ˈ|s|ɛr|ə|k|juː|s}}) is a [[City (New York)|city]] in and the [[county seat]] of [[Onondaga County, New York|Onondaga County]], [[New York]], United States. It is the largest U.S. city with the name &quot;[[Syracuse (disambiguation)|Syracuse]]&quot;, and is the fifth most populous city in the state of New York.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.census.gov/popest/cities/tables/SUB-EST2008-01.csv ]{{dead link|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[United States Census 2010|2010 census]], the city population was 145,170 (making it the [[List of United States cities by population|175th largest city in the country]]), and its [[Syracuse metropolitan area|metropolitan area]] had a population of 662,577. It is the economic and educational hub of [[Central New York]], a region with over a million inhabitants. Syracuse is also well-provided with convention sites, with a [[Oncenter|downtown convention complex]] and, directly west of the city, the [[Empire Expo Center]], which hosts the annual [[Great New York State Fair]]. The city derives its name from [[Syracuse, Sicily|Siracusa]], a city on the eastern coast of the Italian island of Sicily.

The city has functioned as a major crossroads over the last two centuries, first between the [[Erie Canal]] and its branch canals, then of the [[Rail transport in the United States|railway network]]. Today, Syracuse is located at the intersection of Interstates [[Interstate 81|81]] and [[Interstate 90|90]], and [[Syracuse Hancock International Airport|its airport]] is the largest in the region. Syracuse is a home to [[Syracuse University]], a major research university; the [[State University of New York Upstate Medical University|SUNY Upstate Medical University and Hospital]], the city's largest employer; [[State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry|SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry]], and other colleges and professional schools. In 2010 [[Forbes]] rated Syracuse 4th in the top 10 places to raise a family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.forbes.com/2010/06/04/best-places-family-lifestyle-real-estate-cities-kids.html | title = America's Best Places to Raise a Family |work = Forbes | first=Francesca | last=Levy | date=June 7, 2010|archiveurl=http://archive.is/2UFa|archivedate=September 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Salt and limestone===
{{See also|Onondaga Formation}}

Many geological events occurred over the centuries which shaped the land. The most recent was the [[Great Ice Age]]. The last sheet of ice formed the [[Finger Lakes]], the [[Adirondack Mountains]], and [[Onondaga Lake]], in addition to other land formations in [[Upstate New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;early&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shadesofoakwood.com/pages/syrhist.html |title=Early History of Syracuse |accessdate=November 5, 2010 |work=|publisher=Shades of Oakwood, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iroquois confederacy===
{{See also|Iroquois}}

The land around [[Onondaga Lake]] had been inhabited by Native Americans for 4,000 to 5,000 years. The Five Nations of the [[Iroquois|Iroquois Confederacy]] is composed of the [[Mohawk people|Mohawks]], the [[Seneca people|Senecas]], the Onondagas, the Oneidas, and the [[Cayuga people|Cayugas]]. Each nation's territory is located in what is now New York State. The Onondagas lived in the area around Onondaga Lake in [[Central New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;early&quot;/&gt;

By 1722, the [[Tuscarora people]] joined with the [[Iroquois]] and the confederacy then became known as the Six Nations.&lt;ref name=&quot;early&quot;/&gt;

===French contact===
{{See also|French in Syracuse, New York|Sainte Marie among the Iroquois}}

The first known Europeans in the area were the French who arrived in 1615 when [[Samuel de Champlain]] launched an attack against the [[Onondaga nation|Onondagas]] with the aid of the [[Wyandot people|Huron]] and [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] Indians who were bitter enemies of the [[Iroquois]].&lt;ref name=&quot;early&quot;/&gt;  Champlain's attack of the Onondaga fortress, the location of which has been heavily debated, but is now believed to have been located at the head of Onondaga Lake, lasted six days and ended when Champlain withdrew wounded and defeated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bradley|first=James W.|title=Evolution of the Onondaga Iroquois, Accommodating Change 1500–1655|year=1987|publisher=Syracuse University Press|location=Syracuse, NY|isbn=0-8032-6236|page=113|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-kdlRYsGCsoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_atb#v=onepage&amp;q=Champlain&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1640s, which were years of &quot;troubling&quot; battles between the French, Huron and Iroquois, many Jesuit priests were killed. Many French missionaries who arrived in the area from Canada, retreated to the north.&lt;ref name=&quot;battles&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cnylink.com/cnynews/view_news.php?news_id=1268838538 |title=A Path of History on Onondaga Lake |accessdate=December 3, 2010 |first=Farah |last=Jadran Pike |publisher=CNYlink Local News, March 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 5, 1654, [[Simon LeMoyne|Father Simon LeMoyne]], a [[Jesuit]] missionary, arrived in the [[Onondaga people|Onondaga village]]. During his short stay, LeMoyne drank from a spring which the [[Onondaga people|Onondagas]] believed to be foul due to an evil spirit. He found it to be a salt water spring and he returned to Canada with salt made from the spring water.&lt;ref name=&quot;early&quot;/&gt;

A French mission, ''Sainte Marie Among the Iroquois'', or ''[[Sainte Marie among the Iroquois|Ste. Marie de Gannentaha]]'', was established in the summer of 1656, on [[Onondaga Lake]].&lt;ref name=&quot;battles&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;saintemarie&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.superpages.com/cities/Syracuse-NY/ |title=Syracuse City Guide |accessdate=November 5, 2010 |publisher=SuperMedia LLC., 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===British arrive===
{{See also|British in Syracuse, New York}}

The British began to take an active interest in the land around [[Onondaga Lake]] in the early 1700s. They befriended the [[Onondaga people|Onondagas]] by giving them guns, which were highly prized. A British agent, [[Sir William Johnson, 1st Baronet|William Johnson]], acquired {{Convert|200,000|acre|m2}} of land in the [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]] country near present day [[Johnstown (city), New York|Johnstown, New York]]. In 1751, Johnson heard that the French intended on securing a military post in the vicinity of the salt springs. He discussed the consequences of that action with the [[Onondaga people|Onondagas]] and proposed that they grant him rights to all of [[Onondaga Lake]] and a two-mile (3&amp;nbsp;km) band of land around it. The [[Onondaga people|Onondagas]] agreed and were paid £350 sterling.&lt;ref name=&quot;early&quot;/&gt;

===Revolutionary War===
{{See also|American Revolutionary War}}

[[File:Iroquois western goods.jpg|thumb|right|Iroquois engaging in trade with Europeans (1722)]]

As the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] approached, both the British and the Americans sought [[Iroquois]] support. The British succeeded and by the end of the war, only the [[Oneida nation|Oneidas]] and [[Tuscaroras]], a recent addition to the nation,  had remained neutral or friendly to the Americans.&lt;ref name=&quot;early&quot;/&gt;

The end result of the [[American Revolutionary War]] was the [[Treaty of Fort Stanwix (1784)]] enacted by the United States on October 22, 1784. The lands of the natives were distributed by treaties soon after. In 1788, the lands around [[Onondaga Lake]] were transferred from the [[Onondaga Nation]] to local salt producers.&lt;ref name=&quot;brine&quot;/&gt;

The [[Oneida nation|Oneidas]] and the [[Tuscaroras]] were able to secure the lands which they inhabited. Offers of reservations were made to the four nations that opposed the Americans. The [[Onondaga people|Onondagas]], [[Seneca nation|Senecas]], and [[Cayuga nation|Cayugas]] accepted the offer. The [[Mohawk nation|Mohawks]] refused and sought refuge in Canada similar to other British sympathizers.&lt;ref name=&quot;early&quot;/&gt;

In later years the [[Onondaga people|Onondagas]] began selling their land in order to gain items brought by white men to the area. Their reservation diminished slowly over time.&lt;ref name=&quot;early&quot;/&gt;

===Early settlers===
{{See also|Notable citizens of Syracuse, New York}}

After the [[American Revolutionary War]], more settlers came to the area, mostly to trade with the [[Onondaga Nation]]. [[Ephraim Webster]] left the [[Continental Army]] to settle in 1784, along with [[Asa Danforth]], another participant in the war. [[Comfort Tyler]], whose engineering skill contributed to regional development, arrived four years later. All three settled in Onondaga Hollow south of the present city center at the head of [[Onondaga Lake]], which was then marshy.

[[File:Onondaga-valley 1906.jpg|thumb|right|Onondaga Valley outside Syracuse, New York]]

In late 1788, after the enactment of the [[Treaty of Fort Stanwix (1784)]] in which the [[Onondaga Nation]] relinquished part of their reservation including Onondaga Hollow to the local salt producers. The land was now open to settlers and the natives were left with only hunting and fishing rights. Tyler and Danforth began making salt for the family, but did not produce it to sell. Danforth built a sawmill and gristmill and Tyler laid the first roads and built bridges, and in the future would support the building of churches and schools.&lt;ref name=&quot;early&quot;/&gt;

===Swamp land===
The ground upon which the city of Syracuse now stands was originally part of the Onondaga Salt Springs Reservation. The first locality which received a name was called Webster's Landing after early settler, [[Ephraim Webster]] who was an Indian trader on the banks of the [[Onondaga Creek]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bannan&quot;/&gt;

By 1793, the [[Westside, Syracuse|Westside]] of the future city was described as &quot;dark, gloomy, and almost impenetrable swamp that was a favorite resort for wolves, bears, wildcats, mud-turtles, and swamp rattlesnakes.&quot; The western portion of the valley about Syracuse was originally timbered with [[Tsuga|hemlock]], [[birch]] and [[maple|soft maple]]; the eastern portion with [[Juniperus virginiana|cedar]] and [[pine]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bannan&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jioVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA181&amp;lpg=PA181&amp;dq=the+irish+of+onondaga+county&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8hD-T4lC05&amp;sig=2ShuQP-5dhtaYzPBEilZuGLD_2o&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Bg_BTJ66IZT0tgPS4r3KCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CBkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20irish%20of%20onondaga%20county&amp;f=false |title=Pioneer Irish of Onondaga: (about 1776–1847) |accessdate=October 23, 2010|first=Theresa |last=Bannan |publisher=The Knickerbocker Press, New York, 1913}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Syracuse 1900 onon-creek.jpg|thumb|right|[[Onondaga Creek]] in Syracuse, New York]]

During 1804, an act was passed that directed the sale of {{Convert|250|acre|m2}} of the Onondaga Salt Springs Reservation for the purpose of &quot;laying out and improving a road&quot; running from lot 49, [[Manlius (village), New York|Manlius]], to lot 38, [[Onondaga, New York|Onondaga]], east and west through the reservation. [[James Geddes (engineer)|James Geddes]] laid out the design of the new road in &quot;rather an irregular form so that as much dry land might be secured as possible.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bannan&quot;/&gt; The land, now the central portion of the city of Syracuse, was purchased by Abraham Walton for $6,650&lt;ref name=&quot;atlantis&quot;/&gt; and the area was later named the Walton Tract. Michael Hogan and Charles Walton bought a portion of the tract in 1804 and sold it in 1814.&lt;ref name=&quot;bannan&quot;/&gt;

The swamp was almost impassable, but gradually it was drained, cleared, and settled. A gristmill, called the old red mill, was erected in 1805 followed by a sawmill and tannery. Soon after, a settler named Bogardus opened a tavern and across Walton's land [[James Geddes (engineer)|James Geddes]] laid out a {{convert|10|mi|km|adj=on}} [[corduroy road]], which later became part of the Genesee Turnpike.&lt;ref name=&quot;atlantis&quot;/&gt;

By spring of 1819, the water did not sufficiently subside to allow passage until late May or June. Those going from [[Onondaga, New York|Onondaga]] to [[Salina, New York|Salina]] were &quot;obliged&quot; to pass around the area on the high ground east of the city &quot;over by-ways&quot; which were cut in every direction through the reservation for the purpose of collecting wood in the winter for the salt works. Early residents preferred to travel on the road in the winter because it was frozen and covered with hard pack snow.&lt;ref name=&quot;bannan&quot;/&gt;

===Original settlement===
{{See also|John Wilkinson (Syracuse pioneer)}}

[[File:Syracuse 1843-0103 seal.gif|170px|left|Syracuse City Seal, 1843]]

The original settlement went through several name changes until 1824, first being called 'Salt Point' (1780), then 'Webster's Landing' (1786), 'Bogardus Corners' (1796), 'Milan' (1809), 'South Salina' (1812), 'Cossits’ Corners' (1814), and 'Corinth' (1817). The [[United States Postal Service|U.S. Postal Service]] rejected the name [[Corinth]] upon its application for a post office, stating there was already a post office by this name in New York.

The village of Syracuse was laid out into streets and lots in 1819, but the first election of village officers did not occur until 1825. At the time of incorporation, the village had 15 merchants, one newspaper, a fire department, and several small industries.&lt;ref name=&quot;atlantis&quot;/&gt; The first schoolhouse was erected in 1820, the first church ([[Baptist]]) was built in 1821, and the First Presbyterian Church in 1824. The first grist mill occupied the ground where Syracuse High School later stood. This was also the site of Central High School. The village of Lodi consisted of a cluster of homes, groceries, and small businesses situated on the [[Erie Canal]], east of Syracuse.&lt;ref name=&quot;village&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Onondaga Centennial – The Village and City of Syracuse |accessdate=October 26, 2010 |first=Dwight C.|last=Bruce |publisher=The Boston History Company, Publishers, 1896, Vol. I, pp. 440–471}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of similarities such as a salt industry and a neighboring [[Village (New York)|village]] named [[Salina, New York|Salina]], the name Syracuse was chosen by village planner, [[John Wilkinson (Syracuse pioneer)|John Wilkinson]],&lt;ref name=&quot;story&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Revolutionary War veteran's son gave city its name |newspaper=[[The Post-Standard]] |location=Syracuse, New York |first= |last=|date=August 27, 2002| accessdate=July 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; after [[Syracuse, Sicily]]. In 1825, the village of Syracuse was officially incorporated. By 1832, the city had four wards.&lt;ref name=&quot;village&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Syracuse Seal.png|170px|left|Syracuse City Seal, 1848]]

During the winter of 1847–48 discussions about the incorporation of the three villages, [[Salina, New York|Salina]], Lodi and Syracuse began.

The period between 1830 and the incorporation of the city in 1847 was one of remarkable growth in all directions in the village of Syracuse. From a population of about 7,000 in 1830 it grew to 11,014 in 1840, and to 22,271 in 1850. Business industries multiplied, churches and schools were established, and from the small community which has been described, living in quite primitive conditions, Syracuse became a large and thriving village, with a reputation for enterprise and progressiveness that was reaching out over [[New York State]].&lt;ref name=&quot;village&quot;/&gt;

===Erie Canal===
[[File:Erie Canal at Salina Street, Syracuse.jpg|thumb|right|[[Erie Canal]] at Salina Street]]

{{See also|Erie Canal}}

The opening of the [[Erie Canal]] in 1825 caused a steep increase in the sale of salt, not only because of the improved and lower cost of transportation, but additionally, the ease of canal shipment caused [[New York State]] farms to change from wheat to pork production and curing pork required a lot of salt.&lt;ref name=&quot;brine&quot;/&gt;

After the [[War of 1812]], it became difficult to obtain salt from abroad and commercial salt production became an important Syracuse industry. The [[Erie Canal]] allowed the bulky and low-priced Onondaga salt to be transported to Chicago and beyond via the [[Great Lakes]] relatively quickly and inexpensively.&lt;ref name=&quot;england&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilovethefingerlakes.com/basics/geology-saltmines.htm |title=Salt Mines and Brine Wells in the Finger Lakes|accessdate=November 10, 2010 |first= |last=|publisher=ILovetheFingerLakes.com, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1830, the [[Erie Canal]], which ran through the village, was completed. The Village of Syracuse and the Village of Salina were combined into the City of Syracuse on December 14, 1847. Harvey Baldwin was the first mayor of the new city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Our Founders | url = http://www.syracuse.ny.us/Pdfs/Renewing%20Syracuse/Summer%202004/Issue%207%20Page%207.pdf | format = PDF | year = 2004 |publisher = City of Syracuse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Salt industry===
[[File:Salt Sheds, Syracuse, NY.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Salt sheds c. 1908]]

{{See also|Salt industry in Syracuse, New York}}

The [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] missionaries visiting the Syracuse, New York region in the mid 17th century reported salty [[brine]] springs around the southern end of &quot;Salt Lake&quot;, known today as [[Onondaga Lake]]. The 1788 [[Treaty of Fort Stanwix (1784)]], and the subsequent designation of the area by the [[Government of New York|State of New York]] as the Onondaga Salt Springs Reservation, provided the basis for commercial salt production from the late 18th century through the early 20th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;brine&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribunes.com/tribune/sel/bell.htm |title=The Onondaga New York Salt Works (1654–1926) |accessdate=November 5, 2010 |first=Valerie Jackson |last=Bell |publisher=Science Tribune, October 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The end result of the [[Revolutionary War]] was the [[Treaty of Fort Stanwix (1784)]] enacted by the United States on October 22, 1784. The lands of the natives were distributed soon after. In 1788, the lands around [[Onondaga Lake]] were transferred from the [[Onondaga Nation]] to local salt producers with the stipulation that the property would be used to produce salt &quot;for the common use of everyone.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;brine&quot;/&gt;

Until 1900, the bulk of the salt used in the United States came from Syracuse.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia AMERICANA,vol.26,1968&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abolitionism and the Underground Railroad in Syracuse===
[[File:Syracuse 1897 townsend block.jpg|right|thumb|Townsend Block in Syracuse, New York in Clinton Square – The Jerry Rescue Building constructed in 1843]]

{{See also|Jerry Rescue}}

Syracuse became an active center for the [[abolitionist]] movement, due in large part to the influence of [[Gerrit Smith]] and a group allied with him, mostly associated with the [[American Unitarian Association|Unitarian Church]] and their pastor The Reverend [[Samuel May]] in Syracuse, as well as with [[Quakers]] in nearby [[Skaneateles (town), New York|Skaneateles]], supported as well by abolitionists in many other religious congregations.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Jerry Rescue&quot;/&gt;  Prior to the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], due to the work of [[Jermain Wesley Loguen]] and others in defiance of federal law, Syracuse was known as the &quot;great central depot on the [[Underground Railroad]]&quot;.

On October 1, 1851, William Henry, a freed slave known as &quot;Jerry&quot; was arrested under the [[Fugitive Slave Law]]. The anti-slavery [[Liberty Party (1840s)|Liberty Party]] was holding its state convention in the city, and when word of the arrest spread, several hundred [[abolitionist]]s including [[Charles Augustus Wheaton]] broke into the city jail and freed Jerry. The event came to be widely known as the [[Jerry Rescue]]. In the aftermath, the Congregationalist minister [[Samuel Ringgold Ward]] had to flee to Canada to escape persecution because of his participation.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Jerry Rescue&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Edward H. Knoblauch |url=http://www.nyhistory.com/gerritsmith/jerry.htm |title=The Jerry Rescue – New York History Net |publisher=Nyhistory.com |date=2008-02-20 |accessdate=2011-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exponential city growth===
[[File:Syracuse 1900 mccarthy.jpg|thumb|right|McCarthy Building – c.1895 (later Hunter-Tuppen Department Store)]]

{{See also|Downtown Syracuse|Clinton Square}}

The first telegraphic message was received in the city via [[Albany, New York]] in 1840. The population by 1848 had grown to 18,741.&lt;ref name=&quot;growth&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Events in City's History 1848–1897|newspaper=[[Syracuse Herald]] |location=Syracuse, New York |first= |last=|date=October 10, 1897| accessdate=October 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1850, Henry A. Dillare, erected a five-story block where the McCarthy Department Store later stood.&lt;ref name=&quot;growth&quot;/&gt; The city market in the City Hall building was abandoned the latter part of 1852.&lt;ref name=&quot;growth&quot;/&gt;

By 1853, the city was divided into eight wards and in 1856, the ten city banks reported an aggregate capital of $1,535,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;growth&quot;/&gt;

On May 23, 1869, the Onondaga County Savings Bank building was opened for business. The first levy for city taxes collected was $58,441. John Greenway, brewer, gave a public barbecue in [[Clinton Square]] on New Year's Day, 1870.&lt;ref name=&quot;growth&quot;/&gt;

During 1875, there were 200 smallpox deaths in the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;growth&quot;/&gt; In 1879, the city population had grown to 62,243.&lt;ref name=&quot;boyds1879&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Boyd's Syracuse City Directory |location=Syracuse, New York |first=Andrew |last=Boyd |year=1879| accessdate=October 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The telephone was first exhibited in Syracuse on June 12, 1879. The cornerstone of the County Clerk's building was laid on August 11, 1880. Shortly after, the electric light system was introduced into the central parts of the city in 1883.&lt;ref name=&quot;growth&quot;/&gt;

Geddes was annexed to the city on May 17, 1886 and on February 3, 1887, the village of Danforth became part of the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;growth&quot;/&gt;

By 1887, the city was divided into 11 wards, by 1891 it had split to 14 and by 1893 there were 19 wards. The City Hall building was completed in 1892.&lt;ref name=&quot;growth&quot;/&gt;

The [[New York State Fair]] permanently located in the city limits in 1888.&lt;ref name=&quot;growth&quot;/&gt;

===City streets===
[[James Geddes (engineer)|James Geddes]] was hired in 1797 to survey Onondaga Salt Springs Reservation and lay out the first road in Salt Point.&lt;ref name=&quot;atlantis&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://madeinatlantis.com/new_york/syracuse.htm |title=New York, Syracuse |accessdate=November 3, 2010 |first= |last=|publisher=Atlantis, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:View of the Boulevard, Syracuse, NY.jpg|thumb|right|225px|View of the Boulevard c. 1908]]

In 1798, Salt Point became the [[Salina, New York|village of Salina]]. The Surveyor-General, [[Simeon DeWitt]] employed Geddes to design the streets. Although Geddes had no formal training in surveying, DeWitt saw great potential in him. Soon Geddes sold his interest in the Geddes salt works to pursue other interests and surveying continued to be an important role for much of his life.&lt;ref name=&quot;atlantis&quot;/&gt;

Geddes later surveyed and laid out the village of [[Geddes, New York|Geddes]] with approximately 20 lots on either side of West Genesee Street in 1807.&lt;ref name=&quot;lake&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nysghs/99th_anniv_4_19_1931.htm |title=Rich in Tradition, Village of Geddes Recalls Many Events as It Marks the 99th Anniversary of Its Incorporation |accessdate=August 24, 2010 |last= |work=|publisher=Syracuse Herald, April 19, 1931, Section 2, Pgs. 6 &amp; 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1812, early settler [[Comfort Tyler]], then a state assemblyman, secured a charter for the Seneca Turnpike Company. With $100,000 he initiated the construction of a turnpike road (a toll road) on the old state road between [[Utica, New York|Utica]] and [[Canandaigua (city), New York|Canandaigua]]. The road was finished in late 1812 and was &quot;fairly flat and improved communications between the eastern and western areas&quot; and was commonly known as the Seneca Turnpike. This road is known today as Genesee Street in Syracuse.&lt;ref name=&quot;atlantis&quot;/&gt;

From 1803 through 1804, the Cherry Valley Turnpike, which passed through [[Cazenovia (town), New York|Cazenovia]] and intersected the Seneca Turnpike at [[Manlius (village), New York|Manlius]] was under construction. In 1807, roads around [[Onondaga Hill, New York|Onondaga Hill]] and [[Oswego, New York|Oswego]] to [[Salina, New York|Salina]] were in the planning stages.&lt;ref name=&quot;atlantis&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Syracuse 1921 james-st.jpg|thumb|right|225px|James Street in Syracuse, New York about 1921]]

A road was approved in 1809 from Free Street and Salt Street in [[Salina, New York|Salina]] to the [[Cicero, New York|town of Cicero]]. The Cold Spring Road was approved in 1817, from [[Liverpool, New York|Liverpool]] to the [[Seneca River (New York)|Seneca River]] at [[Cold Spring Harbor, New York|Cold Springs]]. In 1820, Geddes laid a road between [[Salina, New York|Salina]] and the Geddes Works. To deal with the swampy bogs he first filled the area with brush and debris from the swamp. This road is now called Hiawatha Boulevard.&lt;ref name=&quot;atlantis&quot; /&gt;

A swing bridge in Salina Street was built in 1874, according to an act of the Legislature that year. The first asphalt pavement in the city was laid in 1880.&lt;ref name=&quot;growth&quot;/&gt;

James Street was an exclusive residential thoroughfare by the late 19th century. The architectural styles of its homes varied from modified [[Spanish Revival]] and [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Italian Renaissance Revival]] to [[Greek Revival]] and [[Queen Anne Style architecture (United States)|Queen Anne]], from [[Victorian Gothic]] to [[Georgian Colonial]]. West Genesee Street, part of the original Genesee Turnpike, had been through many changes since the &quot;old red mill&quot; was built on the banks of [[Onondaga Creek]]. For years, it was a choice residential street. Later, with the invention of the automobile, it became a busy commercial thoroughfare.&lt;ref name=&quot;atlantis&quot;/&gt;

The official opening of the new State Fair Boulevard took place on September 2, 1916. Visitors to the [[New York State Fair]] that year were &quot;pleased&quot; with the {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=on}} wide smooth concrete surface of the road that ran from Hiawatha Avenue to the fairgrounds. The old boulevard had caused much trouble with its &quot;mud holes and sticky surface when wet and clouds of dust when dry.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;boulevard&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Official Opening of State Fair Boulevard |newspaper=[[Syracuse Herald]] |location=Syracuse, New York |first= |last=|date=September 3, 1916| accessdate=November 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exhibitors at the fair who had to haul over the boulevard found their trips cut in half and &quot;the horses drawing loads will be saved greatly.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;boulevard&quot;/&gt;

===Railroad influence===
{{See also|Railroads in Syracuse, New York}}

[[File:Syracuse 1920 vanderbilt sq.jpg|thumb|right|Vanderbilt Square in Syracuse about 1920]]

The first railroad station in Syracuse was in Vanderbilt Square, along East Washington Street between Salina and Warren Streets which was named for Commodore [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]], a railroad magnate and millionaire whose [[New York Central Railroad]] &quot;dominated Washington Street for 100 years.&quot;

From 1839 on, Syracuse life for many years revolved around Vanderbilt Square, the magnet was the railroad station, and the hostelries that grew up around it. In the old station Henry Clay was welcomed on his visit to the [[New York State Fair]] in 1849. [[Daniel Webster]], [[Winfield Scott|General Winfield Scott]], [[Louis Kossuth]], John Brown, [[Stephen A. Douglas]], and other notables were greeted there.

The first street railway was built in Salina street in 1859&lt;ref name=&quot;growth&quot;/&gt; and Syracuse was soon known &quot;far and wide&quot; as the city where the trains passed through the middle of [[Downtown Syracuse|downtown]]. Travelers caught &quot;intimate glimpses&quot; of Syracuse, its people, stores and houses as the trains slowed on their way through town.&lt;ref name=&quot;atlantis&quot;/&gt;

On February 18, 1861, [[Abraham Lincoln]], on the way to his inauguration, bowed from a coach platform.&lt;ref name=&quot;lincoln&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Lincoln in Syracuse; Seen in Joy, Sorrow |newspaper=[[The Post-Standard]] |location=Syracuse, New York |first=Darwin |last=Faulkner |date=February 12, 1962 pg.20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on April 26, 1865, his funeral train stopped for 30 minutes.&lt;ref name=&quot;lincoln&quot;/&gt;

During the 1930s, the city's fourth rail station was constructed along Erie Boulevard East when the rail line through Syracuse was elevated. In Syracuse, the trains ran through the center of downtown, along Washington Street. That elevated section later was abandoned and replaced by [[Interstate 690]].&lt;ref name=&quot;vanderbilt&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2009/01/historians_uncover_old_railroa.html |title=Historians uncover old railroad tunnel under Syracuse's Fayette Street |first=Dick |last=Case |accessdate=October 27, 2010 |work=|newspaper=[[The Post-Standard]]|date=January 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interurban and Streetcar railway===
{{See also|Interurban and Streetcar railway in Syracuse, New York}}

[[File:Empire-united-railways 1912.jpg|thumb|right|Empire United Railways – Halloran Building – Clinton and Warren Streets in Syracuse, New York – 1912]]

In addition to the multitude of rail services in the area, [[Interurban and Streetcar railway in Syracuse, New York|interurban and streetcar railway in Syracuse]] flourished in the city until the automobile, airplane and [[bus]] took their place by the early 1940s.&lt;ref name=&quot;suburbcity&quot;/&gt;

The [[Streetcar|trolley]] or [[streetcar]] served travel within the city limits of Syracuse as early as 1859. In the early days they were either horse-drawn or fueled by steam and by the end of the 19th century they were electric driven. The city was one of the first in the United States to adopt electricity as a transportation motive power.&lt;ref name=&quot;suburbcity&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smtcmpo.org/docs/reports/SMTCFinalCert2002.pdf |title=Certification Review |first=|last= |accessdate=February 19, 2011|work=|publisher=Syracuse Metropolitan Transportation Council, November 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Interurban]] were suburban railways with rights-of-way for higher speed traffic. They linked the city with the countryside&lt;ref name=&quot;suburbcity&quot;/&gt; which allowed people who lived in the suburbs and farming communities to work in Syracuse. The era was short-lived, however, lasting just over 40 years. The first [[interurban]] line was built in the city in 1885 with services to [[Oneida, New York|Oneida]] and the last line completed to [[Oswego, New York|Oswego]] in 1911. By 1932, &quot;every bit&quot; of track had been removed and the entire era was over.&lt;ref name=&quot;suburbcity&quot;/&gt;

===City services===
By 1839, the &quot;turbulent element&quot; of the population became too unruly to be controlled by the old constabulary, and a committee consisting of the trustees of the village, with Thomas T. Davis, [[John Wilkinson (Syracuse pioneer)|John Wilkinson]] and David S. Colvin, was appointed early in 1840 &quot;to report amendments to the ordinances that will give the village a more vigorous police.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;village&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Looking South on Salina Street, Syracuse, NY.jpg|thumb|right|South Salina Street c. 1905]]

In May 1839, it was resolved by the trustees that &quot;there shall hereafter be a police justice in Syracuse, who shall be appointed in the same manner as the judges of the County Courts,&quot; and an act of Legislature was procured for this purpose.&lt;ref name=&quot;village&quot;/&gt;

The first gas company in the city began business in 1849.&lt;ref name=&quot;growth&quot;/&gt;

The Syracuse Fire Department built Engine House 1 in 1859 and a watch tower was constructed in the rear of Engine House 2 in 1862. The department added two steam engines to their fleet in 1866. By 1878, expenses for the fire department were $30,000 per year.&lt;ref name=&quot;growth&quot;/&gt;

The matter of a stable city water supply from either Tully Lake or [[Skaneateles Lake]] was discussed during 1870 and 1871.&lt;ref name=&quot;growth&quot;/&gt; [[Skaneateles Lake]] was chosen and in 1894 the modern water supply system was finally operational.&lt;ref name=&quot;atlantis&quot;/&gt;

===Industrial growth===
{{See also|Industry in Syracuse, New York|Syracuse (manufactured products)}}

[[File:Syracuse 1908-1220 industry.jpg|550px|thumb|left|Wonderful Facts about Syracuse's Industries – Syracuse Herald in 1908]]

The [[Salt industry in Syracuse, New York|salt industry]] declined after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], but a new [[Syracuse (industry)|manufacturing industry]] arose in its place. Manufacturing proliferated in Syracuse, New York from the late 1870s through the early 20th century. Franklin Chase, author of the 1924 history &quot;Syracuse and Its Environs,&quot; summed up the early 20th century in Syracuse with this claim: &quot;In truth, Syracuse manufactured more different articles numerically than even New York City itself.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;brown&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://syracusethenandnow.org/History/IndustrialAgeFedSyracuseBoom.htm |title=Industrial Age Fed Syracuse Boom |accessdate=July 29, 2010|work=|publisher=Syracuse Then and Now, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early years, numerous businesses and stores were established, including the [[Franklin (automobile)|Franklin Automobile Company]], which produced automobiles with air-cooled engines. In 1902, the [[Franklin (automobile)]] Model A attained the distinction of being the first four-cylinder automobile produced in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;wilkinson&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1932-1934-Franklin-v122.htm |title=1932–1934 Franklin V-12 |accessdate=July 17, 2010|work=|publisher=HowStuffWorks, Inc., 2008–2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other important industries included the  [[Crouse-Hinds Company]], manufacturer of traffic signals; and the [[Craftsman Workshops]], the center of [[Gustav Stickley|Gustav Stickley's]] handmade furniture empire.

The first [[Solvay Process Company]] plant in the United States, was erected on the southwestern shore of Onondaga lake in 1884 and the village was given the name [[Solvay, New York]] to commemorate its inventor, [[Ernest Solvay]]. In 1861, he developed the [[ammonia-soda process]] for the manufacture of [[soda ash]] (anhydrous [[sodium carbonate]], a rare chemical called [[natrite]], to distinguish it from natural [[natron]] of antiquity) from [[brine]] wells dug in the southern end of Tully valley (as a source of [[sodium chloride]]) and [[limestone]] (as a source of [[calcium carbonate]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://ny.water.usgs.gov/pubs/fs/fs13900/FS139-00.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The process was an improvement over the earlier [[Leblanc process]].

The Syracuse Solvay plant was the incubator for a large chemical industry complex owned by [[Allied Signal]] in Syracuse, the result of which made [[Onondaga Lake]] the most polluted in the nation.

===Early public education===
The first public education in the area occurred in 1797 in Salt Point, later the first ward of the city, where school was held in a salt block, a special building erected for processing salt. The first district school organized within the present city limits was in the [[Geddes, New York|village of Geddes]] where the earliest known schoolhouse was erected in 1804 on the site that was later occupied by Porter School.&lt;ref name=&quot;cityschools&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of the Schools of Syracuse |publisher=C. W. Bardeen, Publisher. Syracuse, New York |first=Edward |last=Smith |date=January 1, 1893| accessdate=November 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first schoolhouse to annex into the city was constructed in 1805 in the [[Salina, New York|town of Salina]] which was incorporated in 1809. The building, designated as &quot;No. 1,&quot; was constructed &quot;according to the fashion of the day&quot; with the faces of the children turned toward the four walls and the instructor in the middle of the room. The village of Salina was incorporated in 1824 and the school remained &quot;No. 1&quot; until the city of Syracuse was incorporated in 1848. At that time, the spring term opened with about 50 pupils in all grades of the &quot;elementary studies.&quot; During the winter, the older students, many of them larger than the teacher, increased the total to over 100. The number increased so that it became necessary to &quot;seat some of the pupils on the wood-pile.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cityschools&quot;/&gt;

The first school house in the village of Syracuse limits was built on Church Street (West Willow Street) at the corner of Franklin Street about 1826. Local schools passed into the control of the Syracuse Board of Education in the spring of 1848.&lt;ref name=&quot;cityschools&quot;/&gt;

The first high school building was erected in 1868 and was called High School.&lt;ref name=&quot;atlantis&quot;/&gt;

Night schools for adults were established in the 1890. By 1936, under the depression era [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]], funding was provided to hire 300 teachers to instruct 15,000 adults.&lt;ref name=&quot;atlantis&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Syracuse 1920 crouse college.jpg|thumb|right|[[Syracuse University]] – Crouse College about 1920]]

In 1930, the city opened a special school for crippled children and by 1932 the Children's court was established.&lt;ref name=&quot;atlantis&quot;/&gt;

===Syracuse University chartered===
{{Main|Syracuse University}}

[[Syracuse University]] was chartered in 1870 as a [[Methodist Episcopal Church|Methodist-Episcopal]] institution and opened its doors for instruction in September 1871.&lt;ref name=&quot;atlantis&quot;/&gt;

[[Geneva Medical College]] was founded in 1834 in [[Geneva, New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;upstate&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upstate.edu/com/about/history.php |title=History of the College of Medicine |accessdate=June 4, 2010|work=|publisher=SUNY Upstate Medical Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now known as [[Upstate Medical University]], the largest medical college in the Syracuse area, one of only four in the [[State University of New York]] system, and two of only five medical schools in the state north of New York City. The other State medical school being in Buffalo.

===Health care===
The first public hospital opened in the city in 1870. The Milbank Memorial Fund, provided approximately $450,000 for public health projects during a nine-year period from 1923 through 1931 and &quot;helped give Syracuse a high rank in health standards.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;atlantis&quot;/&gt;

===Telephone service===
{{Main|Syracuse Telephonic Exchange}}

The [[Syracuse Telephonic Exchange]] was founded after [[Frederick C. Brower]] introduced the Bell telephone to Syracuse in 1878.&lt;ref name=&quot;bell&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=F. C.

Brower, was credited with installing the first &quot;speaking tubes&quot; in Syracuse and also the first enunciators and began the first telephone exchange which had about 1,000 subscribers.&lt;ref name=&quot;hiramdeath&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=H.

During 1879, Mathew J. Myers, who operated a local telegraph and messenger service in the city, opened an exchange in the tower of the [[Gridley Building]] after sub-leasing the rights from Brower.&lt;ref name=&quot;twophones&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Phones Here Soon After Invention |newspaper=[[Syracuse Herald-Journal|Syracuse Journal]] |location=Syracuse, New York |first= |last=|date=March 20, 1939| accessdate=August 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; D. L. Pyke, superintendent of [[Western Union]], opened a rival exchange in the Wieting Block in [[Downtown Syracuse]]. During 1880, the two rival exchanges merged and named the [[Syracuse Telephonic Exchange]] which was eventually consolidated into the [[New York Telephone Company]].&lt;ref name=&quot;twophones&quot;/&gt;

===Twentieth century===

[[File:Fayette Street, Looking East, Syracuse, NY.jpg|thumb|right|Fayette Street c. 1920]]

By the 20th century, Syracuse University was no longer sectarian and had grown from a few classrooms located in downtown Syracuse into a major research institution. It is nationally recognized for its [[college basketball]], [[college football]], and [[college lacrosse]] teams. In 1911, under the leadership of Syracuse University trustee, [[Louis Marshall]], the [[History of the New York State College of Forestry|New York State College of Forestry]] was re-established in close association with Syracuse University; it since has evolved into the [[State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry|SUNY-ESF]]. [[Le Moyne College]] was founded in 1946; [[Onondaga Community College]] in 1962.

World War II sparked significant industrial expansion in the area: specialty steel, fasteners, custom machining. After the war, two of the Big Three automobile manufacturers ([[General Motors]] and [[Chrysler]]) had major operations in the area. Syracuse was headquarters for [[Carrier Corporation]], Crouse-Hinds traffic signal manufacturing, and [[General Electric]] had its main television manufacturing plant at Electronics Parkway in Syracuse.

===Mid century===
Syracuse's population peaked at 221,000 in 1950. Immigration from abroad introduced many ethnic groups to the city, particularly German, Irish, Italian, and Polish. African Americans had lived in Syracuse since [[Revolutionary War]] days, but between 1940 and 1960, some of the three million African Americans who migrated from the south to northern cities also settled in Syracuse. In the 1980s, many immigrants from Africa and Central America also moved to Syracuse, as they did to many northern cities – sometimes under the auspices of several religious charities. However, these new Syracusans could not make up for the flow of residents out of Syracuse, either to its suburbs or out of state, due to job loss.

Much of the city fabric changed after World War II, although [[Pioneer Homes]], one of the earliest government housing projects in the US, had been completed earlier, in 1941. Many of Syracuse's landmark buildings were demolished in the 1950s and 1960s. The federal [[Urban Renewal]] program cleared large sectors that remained undeveloped for many decades, although several new museums and government buildings were built.

The manufacturing industry in Syracuse began to falter in the 1970s. Many small businesses failed during this time, which contributed to an already increasing [[unemployment rate]]. [[Rockwell International]] moved their factory outside New York state. [[General Electric]] moved its television manufacturing operations to [[Suffolk, Virginia]] and later to Singapore. The [[Carrier Corporation]] moved its headquarters out of Syracuse and outsourced manufacturing to Asian locations. Nevertheless, although city population has declined since 1950, the [[Syracuse metropolitan area]] population has remained fairly stable, even growing by 2.5 percent since 1970. While this growth rate is greater than much of Upstate New York, it is far below the national average during that period.

==Geography and climate==
[[File:Syracuse 1900 onondaga-creek.jpg|thumb|right|[[Onondaga Creek]] in Syracuse, New York about 1900]]

===Geography===
{{See also|Onondaga Lake}}

Syracuse is located at {{Coord|43|2|49|N|76|8|40|W|type:city}} (43.046899, −76.144423).{{GR|1|dateform=mdy}}

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|25.6|sqmi|km2}}, of which, {{convert|25.1|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and {{convert|0.6|sqmi|km2}} of it (2.15%) is water.

The city stands at the northeast corner of the [[Finger Lakes]] Region. The city has many neighborhoods which were originally various villages that joined the city over the years. Although the central part of Syracuse is flat, many of its neighborhoods are located on small hills such as [[University Hill, Syracuse|University Hill]] and [[Tipperary Hill]]. Land to the north of Syracuse is generally flat while land to the south is hilly.

[[File:Onondaga Lake Park.jpg|thumb|right|Onondaga Lake Park in the northern suburbs of Syracuse. Onondaga Lake with the Syracuse skyline in the background. Onondaga Lake Park attracts over one million visitors each year.]]

About 27 percent of Syracuse's land area is covered by 890,000 trees – a higher percentage than in [[Albany, New York|Albany]], [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]] or [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]. This is despite the [[New York State Labor Day Derechos|Labor Day Storm]] of 1998, a [[derecho]] which destroyed approximately 30,000 trees. The [[sugar maple]] accounts for 14.2 percent of Syracuse's trees, followed by the [[Northern white cedar]] (9.8 percent) and the [[Buckthorn|European buckthorn]] (6.8 percent).
The most common street tree is the [[Norway maple]] (24.3 percent) followed by the [[honey locust]] (9.3 percent).
The densest tree cover in Syracuse is in the two Valley neighborhoods, with 46.6 percent of their land covered by trees. The lowest tree cover percentage is found [[Downtown Syracuse|downtown]], which consists of only 4.6 percent trees.&lt;ref&gt;Weiner, Mark: &quot;Census of trees sees healthy population – Syracuse, one of Upstate's leafiest cities, is coming back after the devastating 1998 Labor Day Storm&quot;, ''[[The Post-Standard]]'', April 27, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Syracuse's main water source is [[Skaneateles Lake]], one of the country's cleanest lakes{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}, located {{convert|15|mi|km}} southwest of the city. Water from nearby [[Onondaga Lake]] is not drinkable due to industrial dumping that spanned many decades, leaving the lake heavily polluted. Incoming water is left unfiltered{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}, and chlorine is added to prevent bacterial growth. For periods of drought, there is also a backup line which uses water from [[Lake Ontario]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.osc.state.ny.us/localgov/audits/2003/cities/syracuse.htm City of Syracuse – Executive Summary (2003)]''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Onondaga Creek]], a waterway that runs through downtown, flows northward through the city. There are plans and aspirations to create a creek walk that will connect the [[Lakefront, Syracuse|Lakefront]] and [[Inner harbor, syracuse|Inner Harbor]] to [[Franklin Square, Syracuse|Franklin Square]], [[Armory Square]], [[North Valley, Syracuse|The Valley]], and ultimately the [[Onondaga Nation]]. The creek is navigable, yet can be quite a challenge as its channelized nature speeds up its flow, particularly in the spring, when it may be dangerous. Drownings of youngsters resulted in fencing of the creek through some residential areas.

Its record so far is {{convert|192.1|in|cm}}. The high snowfall is a result of the city receiving both [[lake effect snow|lake effect]] from nearby Lake Ontario and [[nor'easter]] snow. Snow most often falls in small (about {{convert|1|-|3|in|cm|abbr=on|disp=or}}), almost daily doses, over a period of several days. Larger snowfalls do occur occasionally, and even more so in the northern suburbs.

One notable blizzard was the [[Storm of the Century (1993)|Blizzard of 1993]], during which {{convert|42.9|in|cm|abbr=on}} fell on the city within 48 hours, with {{convert|35.6|in|cm|abbr=on}} falling within the first 24 hours. Syracuse received more snow than any other city in the country during this storm, which shattered a total of eight local records, including the most snow in a single snowstorm.&lt;ref&gt;Staff Reports: &quot;A Storm for the records – Blizzard of 1993 brought 42.9 inches&quot;, ''[[The Post-Standard]]'', December 31, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

A second notable snowfall was the [[Blizzard of 1966]], with {{convert|42.3|in|cm|abbr=on}}. The Blizzard of '58 occurred in February (16–17th) across Oswego and Onondaga counties. This storm was an actual blizzard due to the high winds, blowing snow and cold; {{convert|26.1|in|cm|abbr=on}} of snow was measured at Syracuse N.Y. and drifts reached {{convert|20|ft|m|abbr=on}} in Oswego County. (See &quot;Thirtieth Publication of the Oswego County Historical Society&quot; (1969); and &quot;The Climate and Snow Climatology of Oswego N.Y.&quot; (1971).)

January 2004 was the snowiest month ever in Syracuse, with a record {{convert|78.1|in|cm|abbr=on}}.

Syracuse declared a [[snow emergency]] under a new law that allowed municipalities to demand that streets be cleared of vehicles to help with plowing operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Snow in the Cities: A History of America's Urban Response |last=McKelvey |first=Blake |year=1995 |publisher=University of Rochester Press |location=Rochester, New York |isbn=978-1-878822-54-3 |page=133 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Xx9CZkssBfIC&amp;lpg=PA133&amp;ots=4QjLHxZLub&amp;dq=february%201958%20snow%20syracuse&amp;pg=PA133#v=onepage&amp;q=february%201958%20snow%20syracuse&amp;f=false |accessdate=August 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The monthly daily average temperature ranges from {{convert|23.6|°F|1}} in January to {{convert|71.3|°F|1}} in July. There are 8.6 days of {{convert|90|°F|0}}+ highs and 8.3 nights of sub-{{convert|0|°F|0}} lows annually. Extreme temperatures range from {{convert|102|°F|0}} on July 9, 1936 down to {{convert|-26|°F|0}} on three occasions, the last being February 18, 1979.&lt;ref name = NCDC /&gt;

A few recent summers in Syracuse have been warmer than previous ones in the city and, like in some other places in the nation, previous records have been broken. For example, the summers of 2005 and 2002 were, respectively, the hottest and second-hottest summers on record.&lt;ref&gt;Weiner, Mark: &quot;Season soars into record – Warmest summer may affect our winter&quot;, ''[[The Post-Standard]]'', September 22, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Syracuse is the fourth rainiest city in US, with 171 rainy days a year and fourth among the snowiest cities with 111.6 inches of snow annually. Much like nearby [[Binghamton, New York|Binghamton]], being close to the [[St. Lawrence storm track]] and cooler air masses coming in from the west and north, the city has a continuously unsettled weather pattern.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.farmersalmanac.com/blog/2006/10/06/the-10-worst-weather-cities/ Farmer's Almanac, Peter Geiger, The 10 Worst Weather Cities, October 6, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Socio-linguistics===
Socio-linguistics place Syracuse within the zone using the accent of [[Inland Northern American English]].&lt;ref&gt;William Labov, Sharon Ash and Charles Boberg, University of Pennsylvania, &quot;A National Map of the Regional Dialects of American English&quot; http://www.ling.upenn.edu/phono_atlas/NationalMap/NationalMap.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
Syracuse's economy has faced challenges over the past decades as industrial jobs have left the area. The number of local and state government jobs also has been declining for several years. Syracuse's top employers are now primarily in education and the [[service industry]]. [[University Hill, Syracuse|University Hill]] is Syracuse's fastest growing neighborhood, fueled by expansions by [[Syracuse University]] and [[Upstate Medical University]] (a division of the [[State University of New York]]), as well as dozens of small medical office complexes.

==Neighborhoods==
{{See also|Category:Neighborhoods in Syracuse, New York}}

[[File:Syracuse Neighborhoods Labeled.gif|thumb|The 26 Syracuse neighborhoods]]
The City of Syracuse officially recognizes 26 [[Neighbourhood|neighborhoods]] within its boundaries. Some of these have small additional neighborhoods and districts inside of them. In addition, Syracuse also owns and operates [[Syracuse Hancock International Airport]], located on the territory of four towns north of the city.

Syracuse's neighborhoods reflect the historically divided population. Traditionally, [[Irish in Syracuse, New York|Irish]], Polish and [[Ukrainians in Syracuse, New York|Ukrainian]] Americans settled on its westside; Jews on its eastside; [[Germans in Syracuse, New York|German]] and [[Italians in Syracuse, New York|Italian]] Americans on the northside; and African-Americans on its southside.

===Business districts===
In addition to the dominant [[Destiny USA]] shopping area in the Syracuse's Lakefront neighborhood, many of the city's more traditional neighborhoods continue to have active business districts:

* '''[[Downtown Syracuse|Downtown]]:''' [[Armory Square]] has replaced South Salina Street as the main retail and dining area of Downtown Syracuse. Armory Square has around 30 dining establishments, around 20 pubs, bars and clubs, and over 50 other retail stores. Similarly, but on a smaller scale, there is the [[Hanover Square, Syracuse|Hanover Square]] area. A number of professional firms are also located in Armory Square, including [[Eric Mower and Associates]], [[O'Brien &amp; Gere]], and the Sugarman Law Firm.

* '''[[Eastwood, Syracuse|Eastwood]]:''' Calling itself &quot;the village within the city&quot;, this former village still has a retail corridor along James Street.

* '''[[Little Italy, Syracuse|Little Italy]]:''' A neighborhood with Italian origins, Little Italy (part of the [[Near Northeast, Syracuse|Near Northeast]] neighborhood) has several blocks of bakeries, restaurants, pizzerias, shops, and services.

* '''[[Court-Woodlawn, Syracuse|Butternut Circle]]:''' North Side neighborhood located at the intersection of Butternut Street and Grant Blvd (part of the [[Outer North Side, Syracuse|Court-Woodlawn]] neighborhood) has several blocks housing a flower shop, drug store, pizza shop, deli, restaurants, beauty and barber shops, dentist and auto dealer.

* '''[[University Hill, Syracuse|University Hill]]:''' [[Marshall Street]], along with its terminus South Crouse Avenue, is lined with stores, bars, and restaurants, primarily catering to the student population on &quot;The Hill&quot;, as well as the over 25,000 people who work there daily. East Genesee Street at the northwestern corner of the neighborhood has several retail establishments, as well.

Right outside the city proper, along the east side and north end of [[Onondaga Lake]], is Onondaga Lake Park. The adjacent Onondaga Lake Parkway is closed to vehicular traffic several hours on Sundays during the summer months, so it can be used for walking, running, biking, and rollerblading. During the holiday season, the park hosts Lights on the Lake, a two-mile (3&amp;nbsp;km) drive-through light show.

== Transportation ==
{{See also|Category:Transportation in Syracuse, New York}}

=== Public transportation ===
Syracuse is served by the [[Central New York Regional Transportation Authority]], or CNYRTA. The CNYRTA operates bus service in Syracuse and its suburbs, as well as to outlying metropolitan area cities such as [[Auburn, New York|Auburn]], [[Fulton, Oswego County, New York|Fulton]], and [[Oswego, New York|Oswego]].

The Pyramid Companies have also proposed a [[monorail]] linking [[Syracuse University]] to [[Hancock International Airport]] via Downtown Syracuse to their proposed [[Destiny USA|Destiny Resort]] to the [[William F. Walsh Regional Transportation Center]] and their proposed Destiny Technology Park. The cost of such a line has been estimated at $750 million.

In 2005, local millionaire Tom McDonald proposed an [[aerial tramway]] system, called Salt City Aerial Transit (S.C.A.T.), to link the university to the transportation center. The first segment from Syracuse University to downtown has been estimated to cost $5 million, which McDonald plans to raise himself. Due to the perceived low operating costs, the system could run continuously. As of late 2006, the project remains in the planning stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Rick |last=Moriarty |title=High flying idea stuck |work=[[The Post-Standard]] |date=September 26, 2006 |accessdate=January 25, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rail ===
[[File:Syracuse Regional Transportation Center.jpg|thumb|right|The [[William F. Walsh Regional Transportation Center]] in 2009.]]
Syracuse lies on three [[Amtrak]] lines—the ''[[Empire Service (Amtrak)|Empire Service]]'', the ''[[Maple Leaf (train)|Maple Leaf]]'', and the ''[[Lake Shore Limited]]''.

The ''Empire Service'' runs several times daily from [[Niagara Falls, New York|Niagara Falls]] to [[New York Penn Station]], with major stops in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], [[Utica, New York|Utica]], and [[Albany, New York|Albany]] along the way.

The ''Maple Leaf'' follows the path of the ''Empire Service'' train, but continues to [[Toronto, Canada|Toronto]]. This train completes one roundtrip daily.

Also completing one roundtrip a day, the ''[[Lake Shore Limited]]'' connects Syracuse to the same cities as above (except Niagara Falls), but continues westward from Buffalo to Chicago via [[Cleveland]] and [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]], and eastward to Boston, with a branch extending south to New York.

The Amtrak station is part of the [[William F. Walsh Regional Transportation Center]].

A regional commuter rail service, [[OnTrack]], was active from 1994 until it was discontinued in 2007 due to low ridership. Its sole route connected the [[Carousel Center]] to southern Syracuse, often extending to [[Jamesville, New York|Jamesville]] in the summer.

=== Bus ===
[[File:United 737 at Syracuse.jpg|thumb|right|Syracuse Hancock International Airport in 1993]]

[[Greyhound Lines]] and [[Trailways]] provide long-distance bus service. Both also use the [[William F. Walsh Regional Transportation Center]] located in the northern area of the city.

=== Air service ===
Syracuse is served by the [[Syracuse Hancock International Airport]] in nearby [[Salina, New York|Salina]], near [[Mattydale, New York|Mattydale]]. The airport is served by 17 airlines (9 major), which provide non-stop flights to destinations as far away as Orlando, FL and Minneapolis-St. Paul, MN, as well as several daily flights to other important airline hubs such as [[Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport]], [[Boston Logan International Airport]], [[Charlotte-Douglas International Airport]], [[Chicago O'Hare International Airport]], [[Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport]], [[Cleveland Hopkins International Airport]], Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County International Airport, [[LaGuardia Airport|New York (LaGuardia)]], [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|New York (JFK)]], [[Philadelphia International Airport]], [[Reagan National Airport|Washington, D.C. (Reagan)]], [[Dulles International Airport|Washington D.C. (Dulles)]], [[Newark Liberty International Airport|Newark/New York (Liberty)]], [[Toronto Pearson International Airport]]. Six cargo carriers also serve the airport. [[New York City]] (JFK, LGA, EWR), served by 3 different carriers, can be reached in under an hour flight.

=== Major highways and roads that serve the Syracuse area ===
In the ''Tipperary Hill'' district of Syracuse, there is a [[Tipperary Hill Heritage Memorial|unique traffic light]] which has the green light on the top instead of the traditional red light. '''Four [[Interstate Highway System|Interstate Highways]] run through the Syracuse area:'''

[[File:SyracuseHighways.jpg|thumb|right|Syracuse's four [[interstate highway]]s link the city with its suburbs and other cities throughout the country.]]

* [[File:I-81.svg|22px]] [[Interstate 81]] ([[Highway 401 (Ontario)|Highway 401]] via [[Highway 137 (Ontario)|Highway 137]] in Ontario to [[Knoxville, Tennessee]]) runs north-south through Syracuse, and provides access to Canada, [[Pennsylvania]] and points south. It forms a physical and psychological{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} border between downtown and [[University Hill, Syracuse|University Hill]], an issue both [[Syracuse University]] and local politicians are trying to address.

* [[File:I-90.svg|22px]] [[Interstate 90]] ([[Seattle]] to Boston), also known as the [[New York State Thruway]] runs east-west, just north of the city. It is a [[toll road|toll highway]] that provides access to [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[Albany, New York|Albany]], and the north-south ([[Interstate 87]]) part of the Thruway which leads to [[New York City]].

* [[File:I-690.svg|25px]] [[Interstate 690]] runs east-west through the city, and provides access to Interstate 90, as well as to Syracuse's northwestern and eastern suburbs. A spur off I-690 directly west of the city, [[New York State Route 695|NY 695]], provides freeway access to the southwestern suburbs. It meets Interstate 81 in downtown Syracuse in a highly complex and incomplete intersection. Most of its routing through the city directly replaced elevated rail lines, a fact quite notable by the city's former main rail terminal, where the freeway spans the width between the terminal and its outermost platform. In 1981 artist Duke Epolito erected sculptures of &quot;passengers&quot; on the far platform. The piece is entitled &quot;Waiting for a Night Train.&quot;

[[File:Syracuse Interstates.jpg|thumb|[[Interstate 81]] (foreground) and [[Interstate 690]] interchange in [[Downtown Syracuse]]]]

* [[File:I-481.svg|25px]] [[Interstate 481]] forms an eastern loop around the city and continues to the northwest as [[New York State Route 481|NY 481]] to [[Fulton, Oswego County, New York|Fulton]] and [[Oswego, New York|Oswego]], on the shore of [[Lake Ontario]].

'''Two [[United States Highway System|US Highways]] run through the Syracuse area:'''

* [[File:US 11.svg|22px]] [[U.S. Highway 11]] ([[Quebec Route 223|Route 223]] in Quebec to [[New Orleans]]) passes through Syracuse, including downtown, and it follows the route of Salina and State Streets.

* [[File:US 20.svg|22px]] [[U.S. Route 20 in New York|U.S. Highway 20]] (Boston to [[Newport, Oregon]]) passes south of Syracuse.

'''[[New York State Highways|New York State Route]] Expressways:'''

* [[File:NY-481.svg|25px]] [[New York State Route 481]] –  Travels from [[NY 104]] in Oswego to the junction of Interstate 81 and Interstate 481 north of Syracuse.

* [[File:NY-690.svg|25px]] [[New York State Route 690]] – Was built as an extension of Interstate 690 in the northwest suburbs of Syracuse. The route is a four-lane divided highway from its southern end at I-690, where it meets Interstate 90 (NYS Thruway), to its end northwest of Baldwinsville in Lysander at [[NY 48]] and [[NY 631]].

* [[File:NY-695.svg|25px]] [[New York State Route 695]] – Is a short state highway located west of Syracuse in the town of [[Solvay, New York|Solvay]] in [[Onondaga County, New York|Onondaga County]]. The number of the highway was derived from the two highways that NY 695 links, Interstate 690 and NY 5.

[[File:Syracuse-antique-news.jpg|right|250px|Antique Syracuse Newspapers]]

Syracuse has one major daily morning newspaper, ''[[The Post-Standard]]''. Until 2001, Syracuse also had an evening paper, ''[[The Syracuse Herald-Journal|The Herald-Journal]]''. Besides a Syracuse/Onondaga County edition, ''The Post-Standard'' publishes three additional editions: [[Cayuga County|Cayuga]], [[Madison County, New York|Madison]], and [[Oswego County|Oswego]] for the other three counties of the metropolitan area, plus an additional edition on Sundays. It has six news bureaus throughout Central New York, as well as one in [[Albany, New York|Albany]] (state capital) and Washington, DC.

Before the merger with the evening paper, ''The Post-Standard'' was named among the &quot;10 best newspapers in America with a circulation of under 100,000&quot; by [[Al Neuharth]] of [[USA Today]] (run by a competing organization). Since the merger, circulation has increased to over 120,000. Even outside of its four-county delivery area, the paper is available in many convenience stores and supermarkets from the Canadian to the [[Pennsylvania]]n border. The newspaper partly caters to this audience as well, covering many stories from the [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]], [[Utica, New York|Utica]], and [[Watertown, New York|Watertown]] areas. Since opening a new printing press in 2002, the paper calls itself &quot;America's Most Colorful Newspaper,&quot; as almost every page contains color.

''[[Syracuse New Times]]'' is a weekly, free, ad-supported arts and entertainment newspaper. Owned by Zimmer Ltd, Syracuse New Times is published in Syracuse, New York by Arthur Zimmer and distributed throughout the central New York region. The publication is released every Wednesday, with over 137,600 readers, and is distributed to over 950 locations in Central New York. Launched in 1969, it is one of the oldest alternative weekly newspapers in the country.

''[[The Daily Orange]],'' the newspaper of [[Syracuse University]] and [[SUNY ESF]] students, is read by over 20,000 people daily, and is widely distributed in the [[University Hill, Syracuse|University Hill]] neighborhood and [[Armory Square]]. ''The Dolphin,'' the weekly student newspaper of [[Le Moyne College]] is also available, but read mainly by Le Moyne students.

There are other popular free newspapers, including ''[[Eagle Newspapers (New York)|Eagle Newspaper]]'''s downtown edition, the ''City Eagle'', and ''Table Hopping'', which focuses on the restaurant and entertainment scene.

The Syracuse Blazers began play in the Eastern Hockey league in 1973. The league disbanded in 1973.

:''There is also a [[Fulton, Schoharie County, New York|Town of Fulton]] in [[Schoharie County, New York|Schoharie County]], as well as a [[Fulton County, New York|Fulton County]] in New York.'' 

'''Fulton''' is a [[Administrative divisions of New York#City|small city]] in the western part of [[Oswego County, New York]]. The population was 11,896 as of the 2010 census. The city is named after [[Robert Fulton]], inventor of the steamboat.  

== History ==

{{section refimprove|date=October 2013}}
The city of Fulton is a community in two parts. The area on the west side of the [[Oswego River (New York)|Oswego River]] was formerly known as &quot;Oswego Falls&quot; recognizing the nearby rapids on the river. (The name  &quot;Oswego&quot; is from the Iroquois word meaning &quot;the outpouring.&quot;) It was one of the first regions settled in the original [[Granby, New York|Town of Granby]]. Settlements took place in two west-side locations, the &quot;Upper Landing&quot; and the &quot;Lower Landing.&quot;  The community was incorporated as a village in 1835. In 1902, the Village of Fulton and the Village of Oswego Falls merged, and the resulting community was chartered as the City of Fulton. The two sides of the river have long been connected by two bridges-one known locally as the &quot;upper bridge&quot; (Broadway/NY State Route 3) and the other more commonly known as the &quot;lower bridge&quot; (Oneida St.) Both bridges have been rebuilt or refurbished a number of times during the history of the villages and city.

On August 6, 1931, Baseball Hall of Fame pitcher [[Grover Cleveland Alexander]], pitching for the House of David semi-pro team, defeated the Byrne Sieberlings 5-3 in a game played in Fulton, NY. The contest was played before only 2,000 people. The Byrne Sieberlings, sponsored by the J. P. Byrne Tire Company, featured some of Central New York's greatest semi-pro ball players.&lt;ref name=&quot;baseballhistory&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://syracusebaseballhistory.blogspot.com/2012/01/history-of-syracuse-music-chapter-16-no.html|title=Chapter 16 - No Pro Ball, But Great Semi-Pro's, Post Standard, Herald Journal &amp; Industrial Leagues|work=History of Syracuse Baseball|first=Ron|last=Gersbacher|date=31 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The industrial nature of the small city led to a very stable workforce for many years. In fact, during the [[Great Depression]] of the early 1930s, the New York Sun newspaper (NYC) wrote a lengthy article describing Fulton, its residents and the strong local economy. It was headlined as, &quot;Fulton, the City the Great Depression Missed.&quot;

At a May 2009 Common Council meeting, it was disclosed that the City of Fulton was exploring the possibility of merging with the neighboring towns of Granby and Volney to create one larger city. This idea has been floated a several times before and has yet to come to fruition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.valleynewsonline.com/viewnews.php?newsid=85917&amp;id=1 |title=Welcome to Gran-ful-ney? City council muses about possible merger with towns|publisher=The Valley News |last=Henderson |first=Andrew |date=June 6, 2009 |accessdate=July 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Oak Street School (Fulton, New York)|Oak Street School]], [[Mount Adnah Cemetery]], [[Fulton Public Library]], [[Chancellor (tugboat)]], [[John Wells Pratt House]], [[David Van Buren House]], [[John Van Buren Tavern]], [[Volkert Van Buren House]], and[[United States Post Office (Fulton, New York)|United States Post Office]] are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nris&quot;&gt;{{NRISref|version=2009a}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Industrial and commercial history==

American Woolen Mills, a large textile firm located on the west bank of the Oswego River provided uniforms and other cloth-related supplies for the [[US Army]] in both World Wars. Many early Italian and Polish immigrants lived in simple wood-framed company housing and shopped at the company store during this time period. The factory-owned housing was eventually sold to the employee-occupants. Joining the woolen mills was the adjacent &quot;Silk Mill.&quot;  The American Woolen Mills closed their Fulton operations in the early 1950s. The largest buildings were demolished in the summer of 1962.  Another industry located on the west side of the river bank and using the force of the river water to power manufacturing equipment was the Foster Brothers' Knife Works,which produced [[cutlery]]. Besides Poles, the west side of the river was also settled with a sizable community of Italian immigrants as well as Czechoslovakians, Ukrainians, Syrians, and other mostly Eastern European nationalities.
 
The area on the east side of the Oswego River was originally a part of the [[Volney, New York|Township of Volney]]. Over time the east-side grew in industry, commerce, and residential development. In its prime, the east-side had a significant (several square blocks) downtown area (the primary retail business area was once known as &quot;The Dizzy Block&quot;) with nearly one hundred stores and shops.  

Several factories were located north and the south of the downtown area along the Oswego River to make use of the rapids and fast-flowing water for power. Some of the industries located here over the years included Hunter Arms, Hunter Bicycle, Hunter Fan, Sealright-Oswego Falls Corporation (later, [[Phillips 66]] Corporation and more recently, [[Huhtamäki]] Consumer Packaging) making paper and plastic coated packaging, Dilts, (later, Black-Clawson),a paper and plastic machine manufacturer. 

When Peter Cailer Kohler (later [[Nestlé]], S.A.) began chocolate production in the United States, Fulton became home to the first U.S. chocolate manufacturing facility. Many Swiss, skilled in the art of making chocolate, followed the company to Fulton and settled here. Many of their descendants still live in the area. However, in 2003, after more than 100 years in Fulton, the company closed the factory citing the costs to restore and update the old location were out of reach. Factory employees hung the Nestlé company flag outside the factory upside down the day the closing was announced by company officials.

Subsequent to the closing of the Nestlé plant, investors from [[Côte d'Ivoire]] purchased the chocolate factory and attempted to reopen it as &quot;New York Chocolate and Confections Company&quot;. The company filed for bankruptcy and local Oswego County officials tried to find an appropriate buyer for the property so that it could continue to work toward a reopening. On June 30, 2010, the plant and its assets were sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://oswegocountytoday.com/chocolate-plant-sold-to-company-that-sells-to-others/|title=Chocolate Plant Sold To Company That Sells To Others|newspaper=Oswego County TOday|first=Dave|last=Bullard|date=1 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Miller Brewing Company]] operated a plant in the Town of Volney, (just outside of Fulton city limits) from the mid-1970s until its closure in 1994. The former plant was partially retrofitted and was used for a short time as an [[ethanol]] production facility with only limited production. In 2008, the owners filed for bankruptcy and on May, 2009, the facility was sold at auction to [[Sunoco]]. A retrofit was completed and the facility returned to production of [[biofuel]]s on June 21, 2010.  At full production rate, the renovated plant is able to produce in excess of 85 million gallons of fuel-grade ethanol per year, along with 400 million pounds of animal feed annually. 

==Government==

Fulton is governed by an elected mayor and common-council form of government. Administratively and politically, the city is divided into six [[Ward (country subdivision)|wards]]. City hall is located on South First Street near Academy Street and faces a small park and military memorial which overlooks the Oswego River. Fulton supports both a small professional police force and a fire department with two fire stations. The police station and the east-side fire station are included in the city hall complex.

==Geography and weather==
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|4.8|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|3.8|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|0.9|sqmi|km2}} (19.75%) is water.

Fulton is located near Lake Ontario and receives significant &quot;[[lake-effect snow]]&quot; fall in excess of a 100&amp;nbsp;inches per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://fultondailynews.com/index.php/fulton/news/what_happened_to_the_rest_of_the_snow|title=What Happened to the the Rest of the Snow?|newspaper=Fulton Daily News}}{{dead link|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
As of the [[census]]{{GR|2}} of 2000, there were 11,855 people, 4,923 households, and 2,973 families residing in the city. The [[population density]] was 3,102.9 people per square mile (1,198.2/km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). There were 5,501 housing units at an average density of 1,439.8 per square mile (556.0/km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). The racial makeup of the city was 96.80% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 0.74% Black or [[African American (U.S. Census)|African American]], 0.37% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 0.33% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], 0.03% [[Pacific Islander (U.S. Census)|Pacific Islander]], 0.88% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]], and 0.85% from two or more races. [[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]] of any race were 1.92% of the population.

There were 4,923 households out of which 31.8% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 40.9% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 15.0% had a female householder with no husband present, and 39.6% were non-families. 33.6% of all households were made up of individuals and 15.8% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.38 and the average family size was 3.02.

In the city the population was spread out with 27.2% under the age of 18, 8.7% from 18 to 24, 28.0% from 25 to 44, 20.1% from 45 to 64, and 16.0% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 36 years. For every 100 females there were 89.1 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 84.0 males.

The median income for a household in the city was $29,054, and the median income for a family was $38,655. Males had a median income of $35,665 versus $23,102 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the city was $16,133. About 15.1% of families and 19.3% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 25.6% of those under age 18 and 12.7% of those age 65 or over.

==Recreation==

Fulton has a number of parks. Recreation Park, a city-owned facility on the banks of [[Lake Neatahwanta]] once hosted an amusement park, indoor skating/dancing rink as well as the county fair grounds. In its earlier years, the American Woolen Mills contributed greatly to the development and upkeep of Recreation Park. Today there are both football and softball fields, a waterfront area, pier, sheltered picnic tables, grills, and other outdoor leisure facilities. The Fulton War Memorial, a multipurpose group of buildings housing an exhibition hall/gymnasium and related ante-rooms as well as an adjacent covered arena used for ice skating and related sports in the winter and other events during warmer weather. The city-owned park adjoins the property owned by the [[Fulton City School District]] and occupied by G. Ray Bodley High School. The park facilities are sometimes used by the students for selected athletic and social events. On the northwest side of the park is a city-owned [[campground]] that hosts tents and recreational camper units throughout the late spring, summer and early fall. Included in the park and campground is a short hiking and conservation-nature trail. Concerts are held during the summer months featuring traditional and diverse styles of music and related entertainment. On the west side of the River and adjacent to the lower bridge (to the north) there is a park and athletic field complex known as Foster Park. 

==Education==
Fulton was known for the [[Falley Seminary]], a [[University-preparatory school|prep-school]] attended by both locals and out-of-area [[Boarding school|boarding students]]. This institution offered traditional classical education courses as well as some more practical coursework.

Over the years there have been a number of public schools built in neighborhoods of Fulton and surrounding towns. These include Fulton High School and its descendant institution, G. Ray Bodley High School, Fulton Junior High School, Fourth Street School (in the former Fulton High School bulding), Fairgreve School, Erie Street School, State Street School, Oak Street School, Phillips Street School, Pine Woods School, and Walradt Street School. At one time there were also two Catholic schools: St. Mary's School (also known as Fulton Catholic School) and Holy Family School.

A branch of [[Cayuga County Community College]] (CCCC) is located in the retrofitted shell of a former P&amp;C grocery store.
==Business==
Spring 2008, a [[Wal-Mart#Walmart Supercenter|Wal-Mart Supercenter]] opened just outside the city limits in [[Granby, New York|Granby]]. Construction of the store was temporarily halted in early 2007 after the [[New York State Department of Environmental Conservation]] refused access to the area in order to preserve nesting [[Bald Eagle]]s during the Spring season.

==History==
Sherrill was founded in 1916 through a special act of the state legislature. It is unique among [[Administrative divisions of New York#City|cities in New York]], because its [[city charter]]  provides that, for many purposes, it is to be treated as if it were a [[Administrative divisions of New York#Village|village]], and that the Vernon town government continues to have jurisdiction over the territory of the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;charter&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sherrillny.org/?q=node/3 |title=Sherrill City Charter |publisher=City of Sherrill |accessdate=2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; All other ''cities'' in New York are independent of town governments.

In 1997, the [[Oneida tribe]] purchased land within the city, eventually initiating a dispute about whether they had to pay taxes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://docket.medill.northwestern.edu/archives/000862.php Tax dispute with the Oneida].&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
===Overview===

Built on the site of a Seneca Iroquois village, Canandaigua was an important railroad junction and home port for several steamboats by the mid-19th century. After the [[Civil War]], local industries included two brick works, the [[Lisk Manufacturing Company]], several mills, and the regionally prominent [[McKechnie Brewery]]. The shire town of the original county of western New York, Canandaigua was the site of the [[Susan B. Anthony]] trial in 1873. Today, the town is a center for business, government, health care, and education. Canandaigua is the home of [[Constellation Brands]], founded as [[Canandaigua Wine Company]]; [[Finger Lakes Community College]]; [[Thompson Health System]]; the [[Finger Lakes Performing Arts Center]]; and [[Sonnenberg Gardens and Mansion State Historic Park]]. It is also home to one of the largest [[Wegman's]] food markets and the [[New York Wine and Culinary Center]].

===Chronological===

The city was the site of the principal village of the [[Seneca tribe|Seneca]]. It was located on West Avenue where the West Avenue Cemetery is today. The city is also the home of one of three areas of [[Canandaigua (NY)|Burning Springs]] in the [[United States]] where the water appears to support a flame caused by escaping natural gas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nyhistoric.com/2012/10/burning-springs/ Burning Springs « New York Historic]. Nyhistoric.com (2012-10-04). Retrieved on 2013-08-02.&lt;/ref&gt;

The city public high school, [[Canandaigua Academy]], was founded in 1791.

On November 11, 1794, the [[Treaty of Canandaigua]] was signed in the town. The treaty was constructed in hopes of establishing peace and friendship between the United States of America and the Six Nations of the Iroquois and is still recognized by the federal government today.

What is now the City separated from the [[Canandaigua (town), New York|Town of Canandaigua]] to become the Village of Canandaigua in 1815 and a city in 1913.

In 1807-1808, [[Jesse Hawley (merchant)|Jessie Hawley]], a flour merchant from [[Geneva, New York]], who became an early and major proponent of building of the [[Erie Canal]], spent 20 months in the Canandaigua debtors' prison; during this time he published fourteen essays on the idea of building the canal that were to prove immensely influential. {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

Illinois senator and 1860 Democratic Party presidential candidate [[Stephen A. Douglas]] spent three years as a student at [[Canandaigua Academy]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canandaiguaschools.org/academy.cfm  Canandaigua Academy] accessed October 1, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1873, [[women's rights]] activist [[Susan B. Anthony]] was tried in the Ontario County Courthouse, located in the City of Canandaigua, for voting.  She was found guilty and fined $100, which she did not pay.&lt;ref&gt;# ^ Linder, Douglas: &quot;The Trial of Susan B. Anthony for Illegal Voting,&quot; University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law, at http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/trials14.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1945, Canandaigua Wine Company was founded by Marvin Sands. The company underwent rapid expansion through acquisitions in the 1980s and 1990s. The companies eventually joined together to form [[Constellation Brands]] and became the world's largest wine and spirits distributor. In 2006, Canandaigua Wine Company rebranded as Centerra Wine Co.

On March 14, 2006, President [[George W. Bush]] came to Canandaigua and spoke at the Academy, the public high school, and at Ferris Hills, an assisted living community for seniors. The focus of this visit was to talk about Medicare Part D for senior citizens. The text of his speech at Ferris Hills is here http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PPP-2006-book1/html/PPP-2006-book1-doc-pg478.htm

==Geography==
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], Canandaigua has a total area of 4.8&amp;nbsp;square miles (12.5&amp;nbsp;km²), of which 4.6&amp;nbsp;square miles (11.9&amp;nbsp;km²) is land and 0.2&amp;nbsp;square mile (0.6&amp;nbsp;km²) (4.75%) is water.

The city is at the northern end of [[Canandaigua Lake]], in the [[Finger Lakes]] region, the largest wine producing area in [[New York State]].

The city is located on [[U.S. Route 20]] and NY Routes 5 and 21.

'''Poughkeepsie''' {{IPAc-en|p|ə|ˈ|k|ɪ|p|s|iː}} is a [[Administrative divisions of New York#City|city]] in the state of New York, United States, which serves as the [[county seat]] of [[Dutchess County, New York|Dutchess County]]. Poughkeepsie is located in the [[Hudson Valley]] midway between New York City and [[Albany, New York|Albany]]. The name derives from a word in the [[Wappinger]] language, roughly ''U-puku-ipi-sing'', meaning &quot;the reed-covered lodge by the little-water place,&quot; referring to a spring or stream feeding into the [[Hudson River]] south of the present downtown area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|article=Poughkeepsie|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Britannica Online|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/472957/Poughkeepsie|year=2012|publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poughkeepsie is known as &quot;The Queen City of the Hudson.&quot; Poughkeepsie is the principal city of the [[Poughkeepsie–Newburgh–Middletown metropolitan area]], which includes all of Dutchess and [[Orange County, New York|Orange]] counties. It was originally settled in the 17th century by the Dutch and became New York's second capital shortly after the  [[American Revolution]]. It was chartered as a city in 1854. Major bridges in the city include the [[Poughkeepsie Bridge]], a former railroad bridge now serving as a public walkway, which opened on October 3, 2009, and the [[Mid-Hudson Bridge]], a major thoroughfare built in 1930 that carries [[U.S. Route 44 in New York|U.S. Route 44]] ([[Concurrency (road)|concurrent]] with [[New York State Route 55|State Route 55]]) over the Hudson.

==History==
The site of Poughkeepsie was purchased from Native Americans in 1686 by Robert Sanders, an Englishman, and Myndert Harmense Van Den Bogaerdt, a [[New Netherland]]-born Dutchman. The first settlers were the families of Barent Baltus Van Kleeck and Hendrick Jans van Oosterom. The settlement grew quickly, and the Reformed Church of Poughkeepsie was established by 1720. The community was set off from the Town of Poughkeepsie when it became an incorporated village in 1799. The City of Poughkeepsie was chartered in 1854. Outside of municipal designations, the City and Town of Poughkeepsie are generally viewed as a single place and are commonly referred to collectively as Poughkeepsie, with a current combined population of approximately 75,000.

Spared from battle during the [[American Revolution]], Poughkeepsie became the second capital of New York. In 1788, the Ratification Convention for New York State, which included [[Alexander Hamilton]], [[John Jay]], and [[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]], assembled at the courthouse on Market Street, debated, and ratified the [[United States Constitution]]. With its ratification, New York entered the new union as the eleventh of the original thirteen colonies to join together as the United States of America. In 1799, a new seal was created for Poughkeepsie.

Early on, Poughkeepsie was also a major center for whale rendering, and during the 19th century industry flourished through shipping, [[Hatmaking|hatteries]], [[paper mill]]s, and several breweries along the Hudson River, including some owned by [[Matthew Vassar]], founder of [[Vassar College]]. Due to the area’s natural beauty and proximity to New York City, families such as the [[Astor family|Astors]], Rogers, and [[Vanderbilt family|Vanderbilts]] built palatial weekend homes nearby. The Vanderbilt mansion, located several miles up the Hudson from Poughkeepsie, is registered as a National Historic Site; it is considered to be a sterling example of the mansions built by American industrialists during the late 19th century. The city is also home to the oldest continuously operating entertainment venue in the state, the [[Bardavon 1869 Opera House]] (see below).

==Geography==
The City of Poughkeepsie is on the western edge of Dutchess County, bordered by the Hudson River on the west and by the [[Poughkeepsie (town), New York|Town of Poughkeepsie]] on the north, east and south. There are two crossings of the Hudson River in Poughkeepsie: the Mid-Hudson Bridge, which offers a crossing for motor vehicles and pedestrians, and the pedestrian Walkway Over the Hudson.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|14.8|km2|abbr=on|disp=flip}}.  {{convert|13.3|km2|abbr=on|disp=flip}} of it is land and {{convert|0.6|km2|abbr=on|disp=flip}} of it (9.65%) is water.

It is about {{convert|70|mi|km}} north of [[New York City]] and it is located in southeastern New York State.&lt;ref&gt;Crook, Lawrence. &quot;[http://www.cnn.com/2013/07/02/justice/new-york-body-false-wall/index.html?hpt=hp_t2 Missing woman's body found 28 years later, behind false wall].&quot; ''[[CNN]]''. July 2, 2013. Retrieved on July 2, 2013. &quot;The Town of Poughkeepsie surrounds the City of Poughkeepsie in southeastern New York State, about 70 miles north of New York City.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate==
Poughkeepsie has a [[humid continental climate]] (Köppen ''Dfa'') with relatively hot summers and cold winters. It receives approximately  {{convert|44.12|in|mm}} of precipitation per year, much of which is delivered in the late spring and early summer.

[[Image:Poughkeepsie City Bus 282.jpg|thumb|200px|Local bus transit in the city of Poughkeepsie.]]Poughkeepsie sits at the junction of the north-south [[U.S. Route 9 in New York|US 9]] and east-west [[U.S. Route 44|US 44]] and [[New York State Route 55|NY 55]] highways.

Rail commuter service to New York City is provided at the [[Poughkeepsie (Metro-North station)|Metro-North station]] by the [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority (New York)|MTA]]'s [[Metro-North Railroad]]. Poughkeepsie is the northern terminus of Metro-North's [[Hudson Line (Metro-North)|Hudson Line]].  [[Amtrak]] also serves the station, along the Hudson River south to New York City's [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Pennsylvania Station]] and north along the river to [[Albany–Rensselaer (Amtrak station)|Albany-Rensselaer]] station and points further north and west. Amtrak trains serving Poughkeepsie are the ''[[Adirondack (train)|Adirondack]]'', ''[[Empire Service (train)|Empire Service]]'',  and ''[[Maple Leaf (train)|Maple Leaf]]''. Additionally, Amtrak's New York-Chicago train, the ''[[Lake Shore Limited]]'', the successor to the fabled ''[[20th Century Limited]]'', serves this station when coming eastbound from Chicago.

The [[Mid-Hudson Bridge]], opened in 1930, carries US 44 and NY 55 across the Hudson River from Poughkeepsie to [[Highland, Ulster County, New York|Highland]]. The [[Poughkeepsie Bridge]] opened in 1888 to carry railroad traffic across the Hudson, but all usage of the bridge came to an end when a 1974 fire damaged its decking. A local group (Walkway Over The Hudson) raised the funds to convert the bridge into a unique linear park connecting rail trails on both sides of the Hudson River.  The walkway opened on October 3, 2009, coinciding with the 400th anniversary of [[Henry Hudson]]'s first exploration of the river named for him.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.catskillarchive.com/rrextra/pbpj743.Html&lt;/ref&gt; The bridge is now open for pedestrian and bicycle use and is a State Historic Park.

[[IBM]] has a large campus in [[Poughkeepsie (town), New York|Town of Poughkeepsie]], once referred to as IBM's &quot;Main Plant,&quot; although much of the workforce has been moved elsewhere in the company (2008). The site once built the [[IBM 700/7000 series]] of computers as well as the [[IBM 7030 Stretch]] computer and later [[IBM mainframe]]s. The RS/6000 SP2 family of computers, which came to fame after one of them won a chess match against world chess master [[Garry Kasparov]], were also manufactured by IBM Poughkeepsie. In October 2008, IBM's Poughkeepsie facility was named &quot;Assembly Plant of the Year 2008&quot; by the editors of Assembly Magazine.&lt;ref&gt;http://biz.yahoo.com/iw/081023/0445853.html&lt;/ref&gt; Poughkeepsie remains IBM's primary design and manufacturing center for its newest mainframes and high-end [[Power Architecture]] servers, and it is also one of IBM's major software development centers for [[z/OS]] and for other products.

Until 1972, Poughkeepsie was home to the [[Smith Brothers]] cough drop factory. The Smith Brothers' grave site is in [[Poughkeepsie Rural Cemetery]].

==Emergency services==

===Fire Department===
The city is protected by the career firefighters of the City of Poughkeepsie Fire Department. By keeping buildings up to code, controlling illegal occupancies, monitoring the safety of living areas and issuing licenses and permits, the department works to control the potential for dangerous situations. The PFD operates out of three [[fire station]]s, located throughout the city, and operates and maintains a fire apparatus fleet of four [[fire apparatus|engine]]s, including one reserve engine; two trucks; one rescue vehicle, cross-staffed as needed; and one [[fireboat]]. The [[Arlington Fire District]], Fairview Fire District, and [[New Hamburg Fire Department]] cover the Town of Poughkeepsie. The PFD is capable of handling fires, rescues, extractions and natural disasters. Both BLS and ALS Emergency Medical Service calls are handled by Mobile Life EMS who provide the city with as many ambulances as needed to provide around the clock coverage. The PFD is a certified EMS first responder [[fire department]].

===Police Department===
Police protection to the city is provided by the City of Poughkeepsie Police Department. When someone calls [[9-1-1]] in the city, their call is routed to the city 911 headquarters. From there they notify police units in the city, and locate the closest available unit. The Dutchess County Sheriff Station is based in Poughkeepsie and is adjacent to the Dutchess County Jail, which houses around 275–300 inmates maximum capacity at any time.

==Sports==
The [[Hudson Valley Renegades]] are a minor league baseball team affiliated with the [[Tampa Bay Rays]]. The team is a member of the [[New York–Penn League]], and play at [[Dutchess Stadium]] in the nearby town of [[Wappinger, New York|Wappinger]].

The [[Hudson Valley Hawks]] were a team in the [[National Professional Basketball League (2007–08)|National Professional Basketball League]] until 2009 when the league disbanded. The team's home court was at [[Beacon City Schools|Beacon High School]], in nearby [[Beacon, New York|Beacon]].

The Hudson Valley Highlanders of the North American Football League played their home games at [[Dietz Stadium]] in nearby [[Kingston, New York|Kingston]].

Poughkeepsie also hosted a founding member of the [[North Eastern Hockey League]] (NEHL) with the formation of the [[Connecticut Cougars|Poughkeepsie Panthers]] in 2003. However, due to financial problems, the team only played for one season, and became the Connecticut Cougars the following year. The NEHL folded due financial problems in January 2008. Subsequently, the city was home to the [[Hudson Valley Bears]], one of four founding members of the [[Eastern Professional Hockey League (2008–09)|Eastern Professional Hockey League]] (EPHL), for one season. Both teams played their home games at the McCann Ice Arena in the [[Mid-Hudson Civic Center]].

One of Poughkeepsie's most notable sports events was the annual regatta of the [[Intercollegiate Rowing Association]] (IRA), which was held on the [[Hudson River]] from 1895 to 1949. Tens of thousands of spectators attended the regattas, which were longer than present-day races, with varsity eights rowing a 4-mile race. Spectators watched from the hills and bluffs overlooking the river and from chartered boats and trains that followed the races along the entire length of the course. When the IRA moved the regatta to other venues, the Mid-Hudson Rowing Association was formed to preserve rowing in the area. It successfully lobbied to preserve the regatta's facilities and for area high schools to use them for school rowing programs. Currently (2009), area colleges, high schools and rowing clubs are active in expanded facilities.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}  As part of the 400th Anniversary of the Hudson celebration, a recreation of the regatta was held with Marist College Crew as its host.  The events included a fireworks display, a large dinner and the unveiling of the restored historic Cornell Boathouse, now property of Marist Crew.  The race was the historically accurate four miles long and was competed in by [[Marist Red Foxes|Marist]], [[Vassar College#Athletics|Vassar]], [[Army Black Knights|Army]], [[College Boat Club|Penn]], [[Navy Midshipmen|Navy]], and [[Cornell Big Red|Cornell]].  This was also the first time any women's crew was allowed to participate in the historic IRA Poughkeepsie Regatta.

[[Joseph Bertolozzi|Joseph Bertolozzi's]] [[Bridge Music]] is a sound-art installation on the Mid-Hudson Bridge, allowing listeners to hear it played like a musical instrument. A recording of the results, the 2009 CD &quot;Bridge Music&quot; (on the [[Delos Productions|Delos]] label DE1045), entered the Billboard Classical Crossover Music Chart at #18, and has been released globally.  The Bridge Music Listening Stations (which play selections from the CD) are located on the pedestrian sidewalk of the Mid-Hudson Bridge, at each of the bridge's towers. They are open dawn to dusk from April 1 through October 31. Additionally, Park Radios on 95.3FM play the same music year-round, in Waryas Park, Poughkeepsie and Johnson-Iorio Park, Highland.

In 2011 Empire Cruise Lines began the operation of the first dinner and tour boat to call Poughkeepsie homeport in nearly two generations. The M/V Mystère is a 60 foot double decked tour boat which departs from Waryas Park, 29 North Water Street, in the City of Poughkeepsie.

==Name origin==
In 1798, The Holland Land Company hired [[Theophile Cazenove]] of Philadelphia as its agent in the newly established hub for the area in nearby [[Batavia, NY]]. Cazenove then hired Joseph Ellicott to survey the area and establish a village next to Buffalo Creek. Ellicott decided to utilize a hub-and-spoke pattern for the streets of his new village, which he called &quot;New Amsterdam,&quot; and centered it around Niagara Square. In 1800, residents of the small village decided they did not like the name &quot;New Amsterdam&quot; and chose to call it &quot;Buffalo.&quot; In 1808, the name was officially changed to the Village of Buffalo.

The earliest name—origin theory to appear in print (1825) relates a story about stolen horsemeat being passed off as bison flesh, with the site of the illicit picnic thenceforth remembered as &quot;Buffalo,&quot; but the author who conveyed this tale expressed his skepticism.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, Sheldon. ''[http://digital.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=nys;cc=nys;idno=nys294;node=nys294%3A1;size=s;frm=frameset;seq=6;view=image;page=root Buffalo in 1825].'' Buffalo, NY: S. Ball, 1825&lt;/ref&gt;

A currently popular account also holds that the name &quot;Buffalo&quot; is a corruption of the French phrase ''beau fleuve,'' &quot;beautiful river,&quot; a phrase said to have been exclaimed by French explorers upon seeing the [[Niagara River]]. This speculation, however, appears to be contradicted by primary sources; French explorers actually referred to Buffalo Creek in print as ''Rivière aux Chevaux,'' &quot;Horse River.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Houghton, Frederick. The Name Buffalo. Buffalo, NY: Buffalo Historical Society Publications, v. 24, pp. 63–69 [http://books.google.com/books?id=fY4MAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA63&amp;lpg=PA63&amp;dq=Buffalo+first+appeared+on+a+map&amp;source=web&amp;ots=Dg-YQZb0Ur&amp;sig=MOPlDcMG_xdKlwbd_3RzF0wjM_U&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result#PPR3,M1 Books.google.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Much current popular opinion assumes that the city of Buffalo could not have been named after the animal so representative of North America, because buffalo ([[bison]]) supposedly never lived in what is now New York State. However, the historical evidence indicates that buffalo were widespread and well known during colonial times in eastern North America, including the area of the current city of Buffalo. Father Louis Hennepin, in his 1698 book &quot;A New Discovery of a Vast Country in America,&quot; described his travels through the area (during which his party discovered nearby [[Niagara Falls]]), and in Chap XXX included an unmistakable drawing and description of a bison in a wooded setting (p.&amp;nbsp;146 of reprint of Hennepin's second London issue of 1698, edited by Reuben Gold Thwaites, A.C. McMlurg &amp; Co., Chicago, 1903). In his 1889 book &quot;The Extermination of the American Bison,&quot; William T. Hornaday, superintendent of the former National Zoological Park, relayed early European explorers' eyewitness accounts of bison along the shores of Lake Erie very near, if not within, the current location of the city of Buffalo, and as far east as the eastern seaboard. Other sources also indicate that bison were familiar to the earliest European explorers of the eastern seaboard and exclaimed about in their writings, and that later explorers of the interiors of the present Great Lakes states, as well as of most states east of the Mississippi, continued to make note of sightings of bison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/17748/17748-h/17748-h.htm |title=The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Extermination of the American Bison, by William T. Hornaday |publisher=Gutenberg.org |date=February 10, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, although there exists no universally accepted account of exactly how the name of the city came about, it seems probable that it was derived from that of the animal. Many current cities and counties in the Great Lakes region take their names from former English or French frontier forts, and one widely accepted theory points out that the closest of the first European forts to the current site of the city of Buffalo (other than Fort Niagara) was the French Fort Le Boeuf, located inland on a river flowing into Lake Erie in western Pennsylvania, east of Erie and near the current NY border. Fort Le Boeuf existed from 1753 to 1759 at the western boundary of the immense and very hostile Iroquois country, still unsubdued and virtually unsettleable by Europeans at the time. Fort Le Boeuf can be translated as &quot;Fort Buffalo,&quot; since it is believed that the name &quot;buffalo&quot; originated with French fur trappers, who called the American bison &quot;boeufs,&quot; meaning oxen or bullocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=ddblade |url=http://www3.northern.edu/natsource/MAMMALS/Bison1.htm |title=Bison |publisher=.northern.edu |date=July 24, 1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the sparseness of settlement and the lack of specificity in many frontier place-names, not to mention the uncertainties and inaccuracies in early maps, it is not implausible that the city of Buffalo derived its name directly or indirectly from Fort Le Boeuf.

This theory is lent credence by the fact that the first known written use of the name &quot;Buffalo&quot; in the area of the current city of Buffalo appeared close to the time when Fort Le Boeuf ceased its six years of operations. The Buffalo River may have been named before the town itself, with the city of Buffalo deriving its name from that river, [[Buffalo River (New York)|Buffalo Creek]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/83593/Buffalo/235380/History#tab=active~checked%2Citems~checked&amp;title=Buffalo%20%3A%3A%20History%20--%20Britannica%20Online%20Encyclopedia |title=Encyclopædia Britannica: Buffalo, NY, USA |publisher=Britannica.com |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as Buffalo Creek first appeared on a map in 1759–1760.&lt;ref&gt;Houghton, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;  The Buffalo River may therefore simply inherited the nearby fort's place-name on maps, with appropriate translation to English, desired because the usual translation of Le Boeuf to &quot;ox&quot; would have lost the desired unique American connotation possessed by the word &quot;buffalo.&quot;

Modern-day confusion about the existence of bison in the Buffalo area, despite widespread descriptions of bison by the earliest explorers in most areas east of the Mississippi, may have resulted because reference to bison in the area indeed seem to end before widespread European settlement and the establishment of the city of Buffalo, perhaps due to the advance of European weaponry to the eastern Indians before the advance of European settlements. However, by the time of the establishment of the city of Buffalo, bison (known then popularly as buffalo) had already been established as a spectacular and representative North American animal in the minds of people involved in renaming the city of Buffalo, and a history of naming nearby settlements and locations for the animal had been established even when those settlements were not connected in any way with any landmarks or events unique to the city of Buffalo.

It is therefore likely that Buffalo was directly or indirectly named after the common term for bison, even if the naming was purely historical in the sense that the city was named at a time the animal was probably extirpated in the city's locale, and although Fort Le Boeuf had ceased operation a generation earlier.

However, without additional historical discoveries, it is unlikely that an indisputable historical thread can be established leading to the city of Buffalo's naming.

Prior to the [[Iroquois]] occupation of the region, the region was settled by the [[Neutral Nation]]. Later, the Senecas of the [[Iroquois]] Confederacy conquered the Neutrals. In 1804, [[Joseph Ellicott]], a principal agent of the [[Holland Land Company]], designed a radial street and grid system that branches out from downtown like bicycle spokes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Priebe Jr.|first = J.

On November 4, 1825 the [[Erie Canal]] was completed with Buffalo strategically positioned at the western end of the system. At the time, the population was about 2,400. The Erie Canal brought a surge in population and commerce which led Buffalo to incorporate as a city in 1832, with a population of about 10,000 people.

The City of Buffalo has long been home to African-Americans. An example is the 1828 village directory which listed 59 &quot;Names of Coloured&quot; heads of families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Fordham |first = Monroe |title = Michigan Street Church |work = African American history of Western New York |month = April | year = 1996 |url = http://www.math.buffalo.edu/~sww/0history/hwny-michigan.st.church.html |accessdate = 2007-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1845, construction was begun on the [[Macedonia Baptist Church (Buffalo, New York)|Macedonia Baptist Church]] (commonly called the ''Michigan Street Baptist Church''). This African-American church was an important meeting place for the abolitionist movement. On February 12, 1974 the church was added to the [[List of Registered Historic Places in Erie County, New York|National Register of Historic Places]]. Abolitionist leaders such as [[William Wells Brown]] made their home in Buffalo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= African American history of Western New York |url= http://www.math.buffalo.edu/~sww/0history/wwb0.html |accessdate = 2007-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buffalo was also a terminus point of the [[Underground Railroad]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Underground Railroad Sites in Buffalo, NY |url=http://www.buffaloresearch.com/ugrr.html |accessdate = 2010-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; with many fugitives crossing the [[Niagara River]] from Buffalo to [[Fort Erie, Ontario]] and freedom.

During the 1840s, Buffalo's port continued to develop. Both passenger and commercial traffic expanded with some 93,000 passengers heading west from the port of Buffalo.&lt;ref name=&quot;The City of Buffalo 1840-1850&quot; &gt;{{cite web |last = Priebe Jr. |first = J.

In 1843, the world's first steam-powered [[grain elevator]] was constructed by local merchant Joseph Dart, Jr. and engineer Robert Dunbar. The &quot;Dart Elevator&quot; enabled faster unloading of [[lake freighter]]s along with the transshipment of grain in bulk from lakers to canal boats and, later on, rail cars.&lt;ref name = &quot;The City of Buffalo 1840-1850&quot;/&gt;

Abraham Lincoln visited Buffalo on February 16, 1861 on his trip to accept the presidency of the United States.

In addition to sending many soldiers to the Union effort, Buffalo manufacturers supplied important war material. For example, the Niagara Steam Forge Works manufactured turret parts for the [[ironclad]] ship [[USS Monitor|USS ''Monitor'']].&lt;ref name = &quot;The History of Buffalo: A Chronology Buffalo, New York 1841-1865&quot; /&gt;

[[Grover Cleveland]] served as Sheriff of Erie County (1871–1873), and was Mayor of Buffalo in 1882. He was later [[Governor of New York]] (1883–1885), 22nd President of the United States (1885–1889) and 24th President (1893–1897).

In May 1896, the [[Ellicott Square Building]] opened. For the next 16 years, it was the largest office building in the world. It was named after the surveyor Joseph Ellicott.

At the dawn of the 20th century, local mills were among the first to benefit from [[hydroelectric power]] generated via the Niagara River. The city got the nickname ''City of Light'' at this time due to the widespread electric lighting.&lt;ref name=&quot;cityjournal&quot;&gt;[http://www.city-journal.org/html/17_4_buffalo_ny.html Can Buffalo Ever Come Back?] from ''[[City Journal (New York)|City Journal]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1881, Buffalo deployed the first electric street lights in the United States.

President [[William McKinley]] was [[William McKinley assassination|shot and mortally wounded]] at the [[Pan-American Exposition]] in Buffalo on September 6, 1901. He died in the city eight days later and [[Theodore Roosevelt]] was sworn in at the [[Theodore Roosevelt Inaugural National Historic Site|Wilcox Mansion]] as the 26th President of the United States.

An international bridge, known as the [[Peace Bridge]], linking Buffalo to [[Fort Erie, Ontario]] was opened in 1927. The [[Buffalo Central Terminal]], a 17-story [[Art Deco]] style station designed by architects [[Fellheimer &amp; Wagner]] for the [[New York Central Railroad]], was finished just weeks before the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]].

During [[World War II]], Buffalo saw a period of prosperity and low unemployment due to its position as a manufacturing center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| title = 1941–1945| work = History| publisher =Parkside Community Association| date =| url = http://www.parksidebuffalo.org/history.html| doi =| accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

With the opening of the [[St. Lawrence Seaway]] in 1957, which cut the city off from valuable trade routes; deindustrialization; and the nation-wide trend of suburbanization; the city's economy began to deteriorate. Like much of the [[Rust Belt]], Buffalo, which peaked at more than half a million people in the 1950s, has seen its population decline by almost 50 percent as industries shut down and people left for the suburbs or other cities.

Like other [[rust belt]] cities such as [[Flint, Michigan]], Buffalo has attempted to revitalize its beleaguered economy and crumbling infrastructure. In the first decade of the 21st century, a massive increase in economic development spending has attempted to reverse its dwindling prosperity. $4 billion was spent in 2007 compared to a $50 million average for the previous ten years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= current city development projects 2007|url= http://www.ci.buffalo.ny.us/files/1_2_1/splanning/listofprojects/ListBuffDev101007.pdf |accessdate = 2007-11-04|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; New proposals and renovations are numerous, especially in the downtown core. As of 2008, the population has continued to decrease, despite the efforts of city officials. (See demographics section.)

[[File:BuffInBloom.jpg|thumb|right|Buffalo in bloom]]
[[File:Blizzard of 1977.jpg|thumb|right|[[Blizzard of 1977]]]]
The Buffalo area experiences a fairly humid, [[humid continental climate|continental-type]] climate, but with a definite [[maritime climate|maritime]] flavor due to strong modification from the [[Great Lakes]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] &quot;Dfb&quot;&amp;nbsp;— uniform precipitation distribution). The transitional seasons are very brief in Buffalo and Western New York.

Buffalo has a reputation for snowy winters, but it is rarely the [[Golden Snowball Award|snowiest city in New York State]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goldensnowball.com/yearly-winners-golden-award.htm|author=Madsen, Steve|title=Comparison Golden Snowball  City Stats 1940 - 2007|publisher=Goldensnowball}}, Retrieved 2013-5-31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weatherbug.excite.com/StormCentral/Excite/StormCentral.aspx?no_cookie_zip=90012&amp;no_cookie_stat=LNFR3&amp;no_cookie_world_stat=&amp;zcode=z4639&amp;story_id=6117&amp;lid=SCSPS|date=January 3, 2012|author=WeatherBug Meteorologists|title=What Are The Snowiest Cities In The U.S.?|publisher=Weatherbug}}, Retrieved 2013-5-31.&lt;/ref&gt; Winters in Western New York are generally cold and [[snowstorm|snowy]], but are changeable and include frequent thaws and rain as well. Winters can also be quite long in Western New York, usually spanning from mid-November to mid-March. Snow covers the ground more often than not from late December into early March, but periods of bare ground are not uncommon. Over half of the annual snowfall comes from the [[lake effect snow|lake effect]] process and is very localized. Lake effect snow occurs when cold air crosses the relatively warm lake waters and becomes saturated, creating clouds and [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] downwind. Due to the prevailing winds, areas south of Buffalo receive much more lake effect snow than locations to the north. The lake snow machine starts as early as mid-November, peaks in December, then virtually shuts down after [[Lake Erie]] freezes in mid-to-late January. The most well-known snowstorm in Buffalo's history, the [[Blizzard of 1977|Blizzard of '77]], was not a lake effect snowstorm in Buffalo in the normal sense of that term (Lake Erie was frozen over at the time), but instead resulted from a combination of high winds and snow previously accumulated both on land and on frozen Lake Erie. Snow does not typically impair the city's operation, but can cause significant damage during the autumn as with the [[Lake Storm &quot;Aphid&quot;|October 2006 storm]].

Buffalo has the sunniest and driest summers of any major city in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]], but still has enough rain to keep vegetation green and lush.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.erh.noaa.gov/buf/bufclifo.htm Buffalo's Climate]. ''National Weather Service''. Retrieved July 5, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Summers are marked by plentiful sunshine and moderate [[humidity]] and temperature. It receives, on average, over 65% of possible sunshine in June, July and August. Obscured by the notoriety of Buffalo's winter snow is the fact that Buffalo benefits from other lake effects such as the cooling southwest breezes off [[Lake Erie]] in summer that gently temper the warmest days. As a result, the Buffalo station of the National Weather Service has never recorded an official temperature of {{convert|100|F|1|abbr=on}} or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/USNY0181?from=tenDay_bottomnav_undeclared |title=Weather.com.

The stabilizing effect of [[Lake Erie]] continues to inhibit [[thunderstorms]] and enhance sunshine in the immediate Buffalo area through most of July. August usually has more showers and is hotter and more humid as the warmer lake loses its temperature-stabilizing influence.

===City proper===
Like most formerly industrial cities of the Great Lakes region, Buffalo has experienced an economic depression brought about by the loss of its industrial base. The city's population peaked in 1950, when it was the 15th largest city in the United States and its population has declined every census since then. The demographic change and the impact of such change on the industrial cities of the region, including Buffalo, is significant; based on the 2006 US Census estimate, Buffalo's current population is equivalent to its population in the year 1890, reversing 120 years of demographic change.

Although the trend is inconclusive at this time, current census estimates indicate the rate of population loss may be decelerating to a stable state. The 2008–2009 loss estimate is 50% less than the years prior, and is at less than 1% year-over-year loss. Whether this trend will continue will not be evident until next year's estimate.

At the [[2010 United States Census|2010 Census]], the city's population was 50.4% White (45.8% non-Hispanic White alone), 38.6% Black or African American, 0.8% American Indian and Alaska Native, 3.2% Asian, 3.9% from some other race and 3.1% from two or more races. 10.5% of the total population was Hispanic or Latino of any race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/36/3611000.html |title=Buffalo Demographics: 2010 |publisher=quickfacts.census.go |accessdate=November 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the 2000 census there were 292,648 people, 122,720 households, and 67,005 [[family|families]] residing in the city. The population density is 7,205.8 people per square mile (2,782.4/km²). There are 145,574 [[house|housing]] units at an average density of 3,584.4 per square mile (1,384.1/km²). The [[Race (U.S. Census)|racial]] makeup of the city is 54.43% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 37.23% African American, 0.77% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 1.40% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], 0.04% [[Pacific Islander (U.S. Census)|Pacific Islander]], 3.68% from other races, and 2.45% from two or more races. 7.54% of the population are [[Hispanics in the United States|Hispanic]] or Latino of any race. The top 5 largest ancestries include [[German American|German]] (13.6%), [[Irish American|Irish]] (12.2%), [[Italian American|Italian]] (11.7%), [[Polish American|Polish]] (11.7%), and [[English American|English]] (4.0%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.city-data.com/city/Buffalo-New-York.html |title=Buffalo, New York (NY) Detailed Profile – relocation, real estate, travel, jobs, hospitals, schools, crime, news, sex offenders |publisher=City-data.com |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were 122,720 households out of which 28.6% have children under the age of 18 living with them, 27.6% are married couples living together, 22.3% have a female householder with no husband present, and 45.4% are non-families. 37.7% of all households are made up of individuals and 12.1% have someone living alone who is 65 years of age or older. The average household size is 2.29 and the average family size is 3.07.

In the city the population included 26.3% under the age of 18, 11.3% from 18 to 24, 29.3% from 25 to 44, 19.6% from 45 to 64, and 13.4% who are 65 years of age or older. The median age is 34 years. For every 100 females there are 88.6 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there are 83.5 males.

The [[median household income|median income]] for a household in the city is $24,536, and the median income for a family is $30,614. Males have a median income of $30,938 versus $23,982 for females. The per capita income for the city is $14,991. 26.6% of the population and 23.0% of families are below the poverty line. Out of the total population, 38.4% of those under the age of 18 and 14.0% of those 65 and older are living below the poverty line.

Buffalo has very sizable populations of [[Irish American|Irish]], [[Italian American|Italian]], [[Polish American|Polish]], [[German American|German]], [[Jewish American|Jewish]], [[Greek American|Greek]], [[Arab American|Arab]], African American, [[Indian American|Indian]], and [[Puerto Rican American|Puerto Rican]] descent. Major ethnic neighborhoods still exist but they changed significantly in the second half of the 20th century. In 1940, [[non-Hispanic Whites]] were 96.8% of the city's population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Race and Hispanic Origin for Selected Cities and Other Places: Earliest Census to 1990|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|url=http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, [[Polish-Americans]] were the predominant occupants of the [[East Side, Buffalo, New York|East Side]], while Italian-Americans composed a close-knit neighborhood in the west side. The [[East Side, Buffalo, New York|East Side]] is now a predominantly African American neighborhood, while the West Side has become a [[melting pot]] of many ethnicities, with Latino culture being the strongest influence. Throughout the history of Buffalo, the neighborhoods collectively called the First Ward, as well as much of [[South Buffalo]], have comprised almost entirely people of [[Irish descent]]. Recently, there has been an influx of inhabitants that are of Arab descent, mainly from Yemen, as the city's [[Muslim]] population has increased to approximately 3000 according to an estimate.&lt;ref&gt;http://wings.buffalo.edu/sa/muslim/LocalMosques.htm {{dead link|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1950s and 1960s, the greater portion of the Jewish population has moved to the suburban areas outside of the city, or to the city's upper West Side.

===Metropolitan area===
{{Main|Buffalo-Niagara Falls metropolitan area}}

As of 2006, [[Erie County, New York|Erie]] and [[Niagara County|Niagara]] Counties had a combined estimated population of 1,154,378.&lt;ref name=&quot;suny_rkn&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rkn.buffalo.edu/data/topicdata.cfm?Topic=100&amp;Region=777|title=SUNY Buffalo Regional Knowledge Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; The racial makeup of the area is 82.2% [[Race and ethnicity in the United States Census|White]], 13% African American, 0.6% Native American, 1.32% [[Race and ethnicity in the United States Census|Asian]], 3.3% [[Hispanic]], and 1.4% of all [[other races]]. In the metropolitan area, 39.68% of people are under the age of 18 or over the age of 64, and the median age is 38. Of the total population, 82.88% have a [[high school diploma]] and 23.2% have obtained a [[Bachelor's degree]]. The median income for a household is $48,400 and the per capita income for the area is just under $39,000. Approximately 8% of the population is below the poverty line.

===History===
Buffalo and the surrounding area were long involved in railroad commerce, steel manufacture, [[automobile]] production, aircraft/aerospace design and production, Great Lakes shipping, and grain storage. Most of these industries have left the city through the years. Major steel production no longer exists in the area, although several smaller steel mills remain in operation. For example, Gibraltar Industries, a leading manufacturer, processor, and distributor of steel products for the building, industrial, and vehicular markets is headquartered in Buffalo. As of the [[1950 United States Census]], Buffalo was the 15th largest city in the country, the nation's largest inland port (twelfth overall), second biggest rail center, sixth largest steel producer, and eighth largest manufacturer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Greater Look at Greater Buffalo|page=58|publisher=Windsor Publications|isbn=978-0-89781-198-9|year=1986|author=Bisco, Jim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The regional economy can now best be described as a mix of industrial, light manufacturing, high technology and service-oriented private sector companies. Instead of relying on a single industry or sector for its economic future, the region has taken a diversified approach that have the potential to create opportunities for growth and expansion in the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://rkn.buffalo.edu/reports/region_quick_results.cfm?type=4 |title= Binational Buffalo Niagara Region Report |author= University at Buffalo Regional Institute|publisher= UB Regional Institute|year=2011 |work=Regional Knowledge Network |accessdate=February 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Race===
On October 25, 2008 the United Nations released a report entitled &quot;State of the World's Cities&quot; in which the Buffalo-Niagara Falls area was specifically cited as having one of the worst rates of economic inequality in the world and that it was racially based. The report specifically stated &quot;the report cited figures from western New York state, where 40 per cent of black, Hispanic and ethnically mixed households earned less than $15,000 in 1999, as compared to 15 per cent of white households.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/americas/2008/10/2008102321493551343.html |title=UN: Major inequality in US cities – Americas |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the United States Census department also released information placing the Buffalo-Niagara metro area, as the 8th most segregated area in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.censusscope.org/us/rank_dissimilarity_white_black.html |title=Segregation: Dissimilarity Indices |publisher=CensusScope |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Employment===
Overall, employment in Buffalo has shifted as its population has declined and manufacturing has left. Buffalo's 2005 unemployment rate was 6.6%, contrasted with New York State's 5.0% rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.labor.state.ny.us/workforceindustrydata/wny/WesternSlideShows.asp |title=See Erie County |publisher=Labor.state.ny.us |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; And from the fourth quarter of 2005 to the fourth quarter of 2006, Erie County had no net job growth, ranking it 271st among the 326 largest counties in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/news.release/cewqtr.t01.htm |title=BLS, Table 1. Covered establishments, employment, and wages in the 326 largest counties, fourth quarter 2006 |publisher=Bls.gov |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet the area has recently seen an upswing in job growth as unemployment has dropped to only 4.9% in July 2007 from 5.2% in 2006 and 6.6% in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.labor.state.ny.us/workforceindustrydata/PressReleases/prtbur.txt |title=New York |publisher=Labor.state.ny.us |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The area's manufacturing jobs have continued to show the largest losses in jobs with over 17,000 fewer than at the start of 2006. Yet other sectors of the economy have outdistanced manufacturing and are seeing large increases. Educational and health services added over 30,400 jobs in 2006 and over 20,500 jobs have been added in the professional and business (mostly finance) arena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/albany/ |title='&amp;#39;bizjournals.com'&amp;#39; |publisher=Bizjournals.com |date=October 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Life sciences===
Buffalo has increasingly become a center for [[bioinformatics]] and [[human genome]] research, including work by researchers at the [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|University at Buffalo]] and the [[Roswell Park Cancer Institute]]. This consortium is known as the [[Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus]]. It also includes: Buffalo Hearing &amp; Speech Center, Buffalo Medical Group Foundation, [[Hauptman-Woodward Medical Research Institute]], Kaleida Health, Olmsted Center for the Visually Impaired, Cleveland BioLabs and Upstate New York Transplant Services. The DNA samples used in The Human Genome Project were also collected from anonymous donors from Buffalo.

Entrepreneurial resources and life science business consultants accelerate the growth and development of emerging companies found within the [[Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus]] and Upstate New York Region. For example, Buffalo BioSciences is a technology commercialization partner to the New York State Center of Excellence in Bioinformatics &amp; Life Sciences and contributed to the launch and early success of Empire Genomics&amp;nbsp;–- a firm based on research conducted at Roswell Park Cancer Institute by Dr. Norma Nowak&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.empiregenomics.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=60&amp;Itemid=82 |title=About the Founder |publisher=Empiregenomics.com |date=March 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; enabling the delivery of personalized medicine.

===Banking===
[[File:Buffalo savingsbank.JPG|thumb|right|[[Buffalo Savings Bank]] Building]]
Buffalo is the headquarters of [[M&amp;T Bank]], a large regional bank with assets over $79B (as of June 2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mtb.com/aboutus/Pages/WhoIsMT.aspx |title=M&amp;T Bank : Who Is M&amp;T |publisher=Mtb.com |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[HSBC Bank USA]] has reduced its local operations in Buffalo, and Upstate NY as a whole, as it closed its retail banking centers. Many of the shuttered HSBC retail banking centers in upstate were acquired by First Niagara Bank (see below). Other banks, such as [[Bank of America]] and [[KeyBank]] have corporate operations in Buffalo. [[Citigroup]] also has regional offices in [[Amherst, New York|Amherst]], Buffalo's largest suburb. Buffalo has also become a hub of the debt collection industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Thompson | first = Carolyn | authorlink =| coauthors =| title = Buffalo's debt collectors accused of bullying =| agency = Associated Press| date = January 5, 2010| url = http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Buffalos-debt-collectors-apf-2226423347.html?x=0| doi =| accessdate = 2010-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[First Niagara Bank]] recently moved its headquarters to downtown Buffalo from nearby [[Lockport (city), New York|Lockport]]. First Niagara has branches from Buffalo to [[Albany, New York]], and since September 2009 has had branches as far south as [[Pittsburgh]]. On September 10, 2009, First Niagara announced the relocation of its corporate headquarters from Lockport to downtown Buffalo. The company says facilities in Lockport will remain open and fully staffed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fnfg.com/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=847 |title=First Niagara 2009 |publisher=Fnfg.com |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; First Niagara, which had been considering expanding into [[Western Pennsylvania]] for some time,&lt;ref name=PNC&gt;[http://kdka.com/business/PNC.First.Niagara.2.978660.html KDKA-TV] {{dead link|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; benefited from [[PNC Financial Services]] being required by the [[United States Department of Justice]] to sell off 50 [[National City Corp.|National City]] branches in the [[Pittsburgh]] area and 11 more branches in and around [[Erie, Pennsylvania|Erie]] to competitors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/documents/branches-divested.pdf |title=United States Department of Justice |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; since the two banks had significant overlap in [[Western Pennsylvania]] and had potential [[antitrust]] issues in that area. First Niagara took advantage by buying 57 of the 61 National City branches from PNC that had to be divested after PNC acquired National City with funds from the [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008|$700 billion bailout plan]] after National City became a victim of the [[subprime mortgage crisis]]. The move affected the area by creating 200 more jobs, some in the Buffalo area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fnfg.com/pdf/pressRelease_04072009.pdf |title=First Niagara 2009 |publisher=Fnfg.com |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 31, 2011, it was announced First Niagara had acquired all of HSBC Banks Western New York branches; after closing and selling some branches to its competitors its total number in Upstate New York had almost doubled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wivb.com/dpp/news/local/first-niagara-to-buy-hsbc-bank-branches First Niagara to buy HSBC bank branches] ''wivb.com'' Published 2011-07-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Politics and Government of Buffalo, New York}}
[[File:Buffalo City Hall HDR.jpg|thumb|right|Buffalo's [[Art Deco]] [[Buffalo City Hall|city hall]]]]
{{See also|List of mayors of Buffalo, New York}}

At the [[City (New York)|municipal]] level, the City of Buffalo has a mayor and a council consisting of nine [[city council|councilmembers]]. Buffalo also serves as the seat of [[Erie County, New York|Erie County]] with some of the 11 members of county legislature representing at least a portion of Buffalo. At the state level, there are three state [[New York State Assembly|assemblymembers]] and two state [[New York State Senate|senators]] representing parts of the city proper. At the federal level, Buffalo is represented by three members of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].

In a trend common to Northern &quot;[[Rust Belt]]&quot; regions, political life in Buffalo has been dominated by the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] for the last half-century, and has been roiled by racial division and social issues. The last time anyone other than a Democrat held the position of Mayor in Buffalo was 1965 [Chester A. Kowal].&lt;ref&gt;[[Chester A. Kowal]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, Democratic Mayor [[James D. Griffin]] was first elected as the nominee of two minor parties, the [[Conservative Party (New York)|Conservative Party]] and the [[Right to Life Party]], after he lost the Democratic primary for Mayor to then Deputy State Assembly Speaker [[Arthur Eve]]. Griffin switched political allegiance several times during his 16 years as Mayor, generally hewing to socially conservative platforms. His successor, Democrat [[Anthony M. Masiello]] (elected in 1993) continued to campaign on [[social conservatism]], often crossing party lines in his endorsements and alliances. In 2005, however, Democrat [[Byron Brown]] was elected the city's first African-American mayor in a landslide (64%–27%) over [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Kevin Helfer, who ran on a conservative platform.

This change in local politics was preceded by a fiscal crisis in 2003 when years of economic decline, a diminishing tax-base, and civic mismanagement left the city deep in debt and teetering on the edge of bankruptcy. At the urging of [[New York State Comptroller]] [[Alan Hevesi]], the state took over the management of Buffalo's finances, appointing the [[Buffalo Fiscal Stability Authority]]. Conversations about merging the city with the larger Erie County government were initiated the following year by Mayor Tony Masiello, but came to naught.

===Parks===
{{Main|Buffalo, New York parks system}}
[[File:Buffalo Botanical Gardens.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Buffalo and Erie County Botanical Gardens]]]]

One of Buffalo's many monikers is the ''City of Trees'', which describes the abundance of green in the city. In fact, Buffalo has more than 20 parks with multiple ones being accessible from any part of the city.

The Olmsted Park and Parkway System is the hallmark of Buffalo's many green spaces. Three-fourths of city park land is part of the system, which comprises six major parks, eight connecting parkways, nine circles and seven smaller spaces. Begun in 1868 by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] and his partner [[Calvert Vaux]], the system was integrated into the city and marks the first attempt in America to lay out a coordinated system of public parks and parkways. The Olmsted designed portions of the Buffalo park system are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] and are maintained by the [http://www.buffaloolmstedparks.org/ Buffalo Olmsted Parks Conservancy].

===Waterfront===
[[File:Buffharbor view.jpg|thumb|right|250px]]
[[File:Buff harbor.jpg|thumb|right|225px]]
Situated at the confluence of [[Lake Erie]] and the [[Buffalo River (New York)|Buffalo River]] and [[Niagara River]]s, Buffalo is a waterfront city. The city's rise to economic power came through its waterways in the form of [[transshipment]], manufacturing, and an endless source of energy. Buffalo's waterfront remains, though to a lesser degree, a hub of commerce, trade, and industry.

As of 2009, a significant portion of Buffalo's waterfront is being transformed into a focal point for social and recreational activity. Recently excavated and rewatered is the Erie Canal [[Commercial Slip]], which is the original western terminus of the Erie Canal System. This is intended to revitalize the original [[Erie Canal Harbor]], with shops, eateries, and high-rise condominiums. Buffalo's intent is to stress its relatively architectural and historical heritage, creating a tourism destination.

===Standard of living===
The loss of traditional jobs in manufacturing, rapid suburbanization and high costs of labor have led to economic decline, making Buffalo one of the poorest among U.S. cities with populations of more than 250,000 people. An estimated 28.7–29.9% of Buffalo residents live below the poverty line, behind either only Detroit,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usccb.org/cchd/povertyusa/povfact6.shtml |title=Poverty USA – Catholic Campaign for Human Development – A hand up, not a hand out |publisher=Usccb.org |date=July 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or only Detroit and [[Cleveland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wgrz.com/news/local/story.aspx?storyid=60244&amp;catid=37 Buffalo 3rd Poorest Large City].

This, in part, has led to the [[Buffalo-Niagara Falls metropolitan area]] having the most affordable housing market in the U.S. today. The quarterly NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Opportunity Index (HOI) noted that nearly 90% of the new and existing homes sold in the metropolitan area during the second quarter were affordable to families making the area's median income of $57,000. The area median price of homes was $75,000.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

Buffalo faces issues with vacant and abandoned houses, as the city ranks second only to [[St. Louis]] on the list of American cities with the most vacant properties per capita. Since 2000, the city has torn down 2,000 vacant homes but as many as 10,000 still remain. Mayor Byron W. Brown recently unveiled a $100 million, five-year plan to demolish 5,000 more houses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/13/nyregion/13vacant.html?_r=1&amp;n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/People/B/Belson,%20Ken&amp;oref=slogin Vacant Houses, Scourge of a Beaten-down Buffalo].

===Nicknames===
&quot;The Queen City&quot;, Buffalo's most common moniker, first appeared in print in the 1840s, referring to the city's status as the second largest city in New York State after New York City. &quot;The Queen City&quot; was also used during the 19th century to describe Buffalo as the second largest American city on the [[Great Lakes]] after Chicago. Buffalo has also been called ''The Nickel City'' due to the appearance of a bison on the back of [[Nickel (U.S. coin)|Indian Head nickel]] in the early part of the 20th century. ''The City of Good Neighbors'' refers to the helpful, friendly spirit of its inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last =| first =| coauthors =| title = Buffalo Widely Knows as 'City of Good Neighbors'| newspaper = Washington Afro-American| location =| page = 20| publisher =| date = August 14, 1951| url = http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2238&amp;dat=19510814&amp;id=CjsmAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=rv4FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4955,329648| accessdate =April 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th century, the city began calling itself the ''City of Light'' both because of the plentiful hydroelectric power made possible by nearby [[Niagara Falls]] and because it was the first city in America to have electric street lights.&lt;ref name=&quot;cityjournal&quot;/&gt;

===People===
Buffalo was first settled primarily by [[New England]]ers. The first wave of European immigrants was a large influx of [[German American|Germans]]. The city was further populated by [[Irish American|Irish]] immigrants first, Erie Canal builders and then escaping [[Irish Potato Famine (1845–1849)|famine]], and infused by [[Polish American|Polish]], [[Italian American|Italian]], [[Jewish American|Jewish]], and more recently Latino populations, all of which have made it a [[melting pot]] of ethnic cultures. The newest immigrants are from Somalia, Sudan and Asia.

The Old First Ward retains a strong Irish identity, and Kaisertown reflects a German heritage. Buffalo's [[Polish diaspora|Polonia]] is centered at the Broadway Market on the East Side. The market serves as a microcosm of Polish/Slavic traditions and delicacies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| title = The History of the Broadway Market| work =| publisher = The Broadway Market| year = 2009| url = http://broadwaymarket.org/?page_id=2| format =| doi =| accessdate =April 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The East Side is now home to African Americans, many of whom came north during the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]]. The annual [[Juneteenth]] Festival is a large cultural celebration organized by African Americans&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.juneteenthofbuffalo.com/ Juneteenth Festival of Buffalo, NY]. Retrieved July 7, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]] Park.

The West Side is home to the city's [[Hispanic]] community, predominantly of Puerto Rican descent. The West Side was once Buffalo's &quot;Little Italy,&quot; but in the 1980s much of Buffalo's Italian American community moved to North Buffalo. There is also a small Italian-American enclave in the East Side neighborhood of Lovejoy. Many Buffalo households, churches, and restaurants continue to observe the Sicilian custom of preparing [[St. Joseph's Day]] (March 19) tables, at which various meatless [[Lent]]en courses are laid out for the poor.

Buffalo is also home to a large [[American Jews|Jewish]] community. [[History of the Jews in Germany|German Jewish]] immigrants originally settled on Buffalo's Westside in the mid-19th century. Lower income [[History of the Jews in Russia and the Soviet Union|Russian Jews]] and [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish Jews]] immigrating to the [[Niagara Frontier]] in the early 20th century initially settled on the Lower East Side, near William Street and Jefferson Avenue. The community migrated to the Masten Park neighborhood on the East Side, and then to [[North Buffalo, Buffalo, New York|North Buffalo]] between the 1940s and the 1960s. Although many still live in the city, particularly in North Buffalo and the Delaware District on the city's Westside, the majority of the Buffalo area's Jews now live in the northeastern suburbs. Buffalo's [[Jewish Community Center|Jewish Community centers]] are located in the Delaware District, North Buffalo and Amherst.

As a melting pot of cultures, [[cuisine]] in the Buffalo area reflects a variety of influences. These include [[Italian cuisine|Italian]], [[Irish cuisine|Irish]], [[Jewish cuisine|Jewish]], [[German cuisine|German]], [[Polish cuisine|Polish]], [[soul food|African American]], [[Greek cuisine|Greek]], [[Indian cuisine|Indian]] and [[Cuisine of the United States|American]] influences. [[Beef on weck sandwich]], Wardynski's [[kielbasa]], [[sponge candy]], [[pastry heart]]s, [[pierogi]], and haddock [[Fish and chips|fish fries]] are among the local favorites, as is a [[loganberry#Uses|loganberry]]-flavored beverage that remains relatively obscure outside of the Western New York and Southern [[Ontario]] area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Two street festivals&amp;nbsp;– the [[Allentown Art Festival]] and the [http://www.elmwoodartfest.org Elmwood Festival of the Arts]&amp;nbsp;– bring thousands of people to the city to browse and purchase original crafts. The [[Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra]], which performs at [[Kleinhans Music Hall]], is one of the city's most prominent performing arts institutions. In the 1960s and 1970s, under the musical leadership of Lukas Foss and Michael Tilson Thomas, the Philharmonic was generally regarded as the leading orchestra in the US for new music. [[Shea's Performing Arts Center]], long known as Shea's Buffalo, is a 1920s movie palace that continues to show productions and concerts. Its interior was designed by Louis Comfort Tiffany. Buffalo is also home to the second largest free outdoor [[Shakespeare]] festival in the United States, [[Shakespeare in Delaware Park]]. Filmmaker, writer, painter and musician [[Vincent Gallo]] was born in Buffalo in 1962 and lived there until 1978 when he moved out on his own to New York City.

The New York Times has declared that Buffalo is one of the top cities in America for architecture. Approximately 80 sites are included on the [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Buffalo, New York|National Register of Historic Places]]. All of the major American architects of the 19th and early 20th century built masterpieces in Buffalo, most of which are still standing. They include:

The country's largest intact parks system designed by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] and [[Calvert Vaux]], including [[Delaware Park-Front Park System|Delaware Park]]. Buffalo was the first city for which Olmsted designed (in 1869) an interconnected park and parkway system rather than stand-alone parks.

The [[Prudential (Guaranty) Building (Buffalo, New York)|Guaranty Building]], by [[Louis Sullivan]], was one of the first steel-supported, curtain-walled buildings in the world, and its 13 stories made it, at the time it was built (1895), the tallest building in Buffalo and one of the world's first true skyscrapers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ah.bfn.org/a/church/28/tc.html Louis Sullivan – Guaranty / Prudential Building]. Retrieved July 7, 2007 {{Wayback | url=http://ah.bfn.org/a/church/28/tc.html | date=20070702045925 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[National Historic Landmark]].

The Hotel Buffalo (originally the Statler Hotel) by August Esenwein and [[James A. Johnson (architect)|James A. Johnson]] was the first hotel in the world to feature a private bath in each room.

The [[H. H. Richardson Complex]], originally the New York State Asylum for the Insane, is [[Richardsonian Romanesque]] in style and was the largest commission designed by prominent architect [[Henry Hobson Richardson]]. The grounds of this hospital were designed by Olmsted. Though currently in a state of disrepair, New York State has allocated funds to restore this treasure.

There are several buildings by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], including the [[Darwin D. Martin House]], [[George Barton House]], [[William R. Heath House]], [[Walter V. Davidson House]], [[Graycliff|The Graycliff Estate]], as well as the now demolished [[Larkin Administration Building]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ah.bfn.org/a/soldiers/76/ William Heath House].

Along as a tourist destination, it functionally serves many Buffalo-area rowing teams belonging to the West Side Rowing Club. Buffalo has more [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] buildings than any other city except Chicago.

The [[Buffalo City Hall]] building by George Dietel and John J. Wade is a spectacular [[art deco]] skyscraper and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

It is also because New York law allows bars to be open until 4&amp;nbsp;am (However, local municipalities can override it to an earlier time.)

Several distinct and [[Nightlife (activity)|nightlife]] districts have grown around clusters of bars and nightclubs in the city. The most visible nightlife district is West Chippewa Street,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westchippewa.com/ |title=Buffalo Bills, Buffalo Sabres, Buffalo NightLife, chippewa street, west chippewa street, Chippewa Street, West Chippewa Street |publisher=Westchippewa.com |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; located between Main Street and South Elmwood Avenue.  [[Allentown, Buffalo, New York|Allentown]] is a several minute walk north to Allen Street. Allen Street near Main Street houses several bars, while Allen near Elmwood has many bars that feature live music. Continuing up Elmwood Avenue from Allentown is the Elmwood Strip, which runs about two miles (3&amp;nbsp;km) to [[Buffalo State College]]. This strip has numerous small boutiques and restaurants, with few large corporate establishments.

===Public festivals===
Like many large cities, numerous festivals have become part of the city's culture and tradition. Though most of the festivals occur during the summer months, the city has recently pushed efforts to have winter festivals as well in an effort to capitalize on the region's snowy reputation.

===Airport===
Buffalo is served by the [[Buffalo Niagara International Airport]], located in [[Cheektowaga]]. The airport, recently re-constructed, serves over 5 million passengers a year and is still growing. Buffalo Niagara International Airport ranks among the five cheapest airports from which to fly in the country, according to the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics. The average round trip flight cost is $295.58.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buffaloniagara.org/files/content/Industry/Back_Office.pdf|title=Buffalo Niagara Region Shared Services Opportunities|publisher=Buffaloniagra.org}}, Retrieved 2013-5-31.&lt;/ref&gt; In the last few years there has been a surge in Canadians flying out of Buffalo, mainly due to much cheaper tax and airline surcharges, as compared with Canadian airports and the ability to fly on some US based discount carriers not available in Canada (for example, [[JetBlue Airways]] and [[Southwest Airlines]]). As of 2006, plans are in the works by U.S. Senator [[Charles Schumer]] to make the under-used [[Niagara Falls International Airport]] into an international cargo hub for New York and [[Toronto]], as well as Canada as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Niagara airport pushed as trade hub; Schumer joins effort to bring global cargo|author=Bill Michelmore|work=Buffalo News|page=B1|date=June 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public transit===
[[File:NFTAMetroRail.jpg|thumb|right|An outbound NFTA Metro Rail train pulls into Fountain Plaza Station]]
The [[Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority]] (NFTA) operates Buffalo Niagara International Airport and [[Niagara Falls International Airport]], and the [[public transport|public transit]] system throughout the Buffalo area. The [[NFTA]] operates bus lines throughout the city and suburbs, as well as the [[Buffalo Metro Rail|Metro Rail]] transit system in the city.

The Buffalo Metro Rail is a {{convert|6.4|mi|km}} long, single line [[light rail]] system that extends from [[Erie Canal Harbor]] in downtown Buffalo to the [[University Heights, Buffalo, New York|University Heights]] district (specifically, the South Campus of [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|University at Buffalo]]) in the northeastern part of the city. The downtown section of the line runs above ground and is free of charge to passengers. North of Theater Station, at the northern end of downtown, the line moves underground, remaining underground until it reaches the northern terminus of the line at University Heights. Passengers pay a fare to ride this section of the rail.

A new NFTA project is underway, often called &quot;Cars on Main Street&quot;, that will substantially revise the downtown portion of the Metro Rail. It will allow vehicular traffic and Metro Rail cars to share Main St. in a manner similar to that of the trolleys of [[Muni Metro|San Francisco]]. The design includes new stations and pedestrian-friendly improvements. The first phase of the project, restoring two way traffic on Main Street between Edward and West Tupper, was completed in 2009. When the entire project is complete in the next few years, the downtown portion of Main St. will be re-opened to vehicular traffic for the first time in almost 30 years.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

===Intercity rail===
Two train stations, [[Buffalo-Depew (Amtrak station)|Buffalo-Depew]] and [[Buffalo-Exchange Street Station|Buffalo-Exchange Street]] serve the city and are operated by [[Amtrak]]. Historically the city was a major stop on through routes between Chicago and New York City through the lower Ontario peninsula.&lt;ref name=drury&gt;{{cite book | last = Drury | first = George H. | authorlink =  | coauthors = | title = The Historical Guide to North American Railroads: Histories, Figures, and Features of more than 160 Railroads Abandoned or Merged since 1930 | publisher = Kalmbach Publishing | year = 1994 | location = [[Waukesha, Wisconsin]] | pages = 91, 229–231| doi = | id = | isbn = 0-89024-072-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] ran trains between Buffalo and [[Washington, D.C.]] on the [[Buffalo Line]] through central [[Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;1957 Pennsylvania Railroad schedules reprinted at http://www.therailwire.net/forum/index.php?topic=17913.15&lt;/ref&gt;

Freight service for Buffalo is served by [[CSX Transportation]] and [[Norfolk Southern]] (NS), as well as [[Canadian National]] (CN) and [[Canadian Pacific]] (CP) railroads from across the Border. The area has 4 large rail yards: Frontier (CSX), Bison (NS), SK (NS / CP) and Buffalo Creek (NS / CSX). A large amount of hazardous cargo also crosses through the Buffalo area, such as liquid [[propane]] and [[anhydrous ammonia]].

===Waterways===
Buffalo is at the eastern end of one of the [[Great Lakes]], [[Lake Erie]], which boasts the greatest variety of freshwater sportfish in the country. The Lake serves as a playground for numerous personal yachts, sailboats, power boats and watercraft. The city has an extensive [[breakwall]] system protecting its inner and outer Lake Erie [[harbor]]s, which are maintained at commercial navigation depths for [[Great Lakes]] freighters.

A Lake Erie tributary that flows through south Buffalo is the [[Buffalo River (New York)|Buffalo River]], for which the city is named. Buffalo is historically linked to the fabled [[Erie Canal]], which ends where the [[Black Rock Channel]] enters [[Lake Erie]]. When the Canal was dedicated in 1825, its conceiver, New York State governor [[DeWitt Clinton]] took waters from Lake Erie at Buffalo's Western Terminus of the Canal (now the [[Commercial Slip]]). He sailed to New York City on the Canal packet ''[[Seneca Chief]]'', which later returned to Buffalo with Atlantic Ocean water. The seawater was poured into the Lake by Judge and future Buffalo Mayor [[Samuel Wilkeson]]. Once a major route for passengers and cargo, the Erie Canal played a primary role in opening up the American West to settlers from the east.  The Canal is now used primarily for pleasure craft and some light local freight, and in Buffalo it bypasses the swift upper reach of the [[Niagara River]]. A tributary of the Niagara River is [[Scajaquada Creek]], which flows though Buffalo, via the [[Frederick Law Olmsted]]-designed Delaware Lake and Park.

'''Cohoes''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|h|oʊ|s}} {{respell|kə|HOHSS|'}}) is an incorporated [[Administrative divisions of New York#City|city]] located at the northeast corner of [[Albany County, New York|Albany County]] in the [[US state]] of [[New York]]. It is called the &quot;Spindle City&quot; because of the importance of textile production to its growth. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the city population was 16,168.  The name was believed to have arisen from a Mohawk expression, &quot;Ga-ha-oose&quot;, referring to the [[Cohoes Falls]] and meaning &quot;Place of the Falling Canoe,&quot; an interpretation originated by Horatio Gates Spafford in his 1823 publication &quot;A Gazetteer of the State of New York&quot;. Later historians posited that the name is derived from the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] &quot;Cohos,&quot; which is a place name based on a word meaning 'pine tree'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=i9sTAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA200&amp;dq=kahoos|author=Edward M.

== History ==
The majority of the city was once part of the [[Manor of Rensselaerswyck]], a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] colonial feudal system; however the land north of a line crossing the Cohoes Falls (today Manor Avenue) was outside of the Manor and was owned by the Van Olohde family between 1725 and 1750.&lt;ref name=Masten/&gt; Rensselaerswyck was established by [[Kiliaen van Rensselaer (Dutch merchant)|Killiaen Van Rensselaer]], the [[patroon]] and a [[Dutch people|Dutch]] merchant. In 1632 he had an agent of his pace off an enormous triangle-shaped area around the confluence of the Mohawk and Hudson rivers, from the [[Peebles Island]] northwest to the Cohoes Falls and south to today's [[Watervliet, New York|Watervliet]];&lt;ref name=page14&gt;{{cite book | title = Hudson Mohawk Gateway | publisher = American Historical Press | author = Thomas Phelan and P. Thomas Carroll | ISBN = 1-892724-17-0 | page = 14 | accessdate = 2010-01-20 | year = 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; this area was the core of the future city of Cohoes. Starting in the 1690s the Patroon began to issue leases for the area of Cohoes, though he did reserve for himself a strip below the Cohoes Falls for the future site of mills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Hudson Mohawk Gateway | publisher = American Historical Press | author = Thomas Phelan and P.

[[Image:1778CohoesFalls.jpg|thumb|left|Engraving of the Cohoes Falls in 1778, one of the earliest images of the falls.]] Though the area wasn't immediately heavily settled it was well known for many reasons. The main was geographic, with the Cohoes Falls being the centerpiece. One of the earliest descriptions of the falls was in 1642 by Johannes Megapolensis, the first dominie (Reverend) of [[Beverwyck]]. Another early description was in 1656 by [[Adriaen van der Donck]] in his ''Description of New Netherland''.&lt;ref name=Masten&gt;{{cite book | title = The History of Cohoes, New York | publisher = Joel Munsell | year = 1877 | accessdate = 2010-01-20 | author = Masten, Arthur | url = http://www.archive.org/stream/historycohoes00mastrich#page/n13/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early-to-mid 17th century a [[whale]] had found itself stranded in the Mohawk River on an island just below the Cohoes Falls, it was impossible for the Dutch settlers of the area to remove the carcass and as it rotted the river became slick for three weeks from the rotting carcass and one commented that &quot;the air was infected with its stench... perceptible for two miles to leeward&quot;; around 1646 this island came to be known as Whale Island due to this occurrence.&lt;ref name=page14/&gt;

During the various [[French and Indian Wars]] during the mid-18th century [[Van Schaick Island]] became the site of a military road that came from Albany north along the islands at the mouth of the Mohawk River. These islands allowed for easier [[ford]]s across the various mouths of the Mohawk and access to Waterford and points north. The islands would be the site of many military encampments during both the French and Indian Wars and the [[US Revolutionary War]].&lt;ref name=page17&gt;{{cite book | title = Hudson Mohawk Gateway | publisher = American Historical Press | author = Thomas Phelan and P. Thomas Carroll | ISBN = 1-892724-17-0 | page = 17 | accessdate = 2010-01-20 | year = 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Van Schaick Mansion on Van Schaick Island was built in the 1730s and was one of the sites used as a military headquarters by the Americans under General [[Philip Schuyler]] and General [[Horatio Gates]].&lt;ref name=page17/&gt; Van Schaick Island was the first part of Cohoes to be settled and farmed, it was formerly known as Cohoes Island and Anthony's Island.&lt;ref name=Masten/&gt;

Until the Revolutionary war Cohoes was a small quiet hamlet with isolated farms.  After the Revolution things slowly began to pick up, and Cohoes was linked to the larger settlements of [[Lansingburgh, New York|Lansingburg]] and Albany. In 1795 the first bridge across the Mohawk River was constructed at Cohoes.  It was 900 feet long, 24 feet wide, 15 feet high and sat on 13 stone piers. It cost $12,000 to build and was a toll bridge. This bridge increased the importance of Cohoes, as it became one of the main routes north.&lt;ref name=Masten/&gt; It was rebuilt in 1806 by the Cohoes Bridge Company and tolls increased.&lt;ref name=page22&gt;{{cite book | title = Hudson Mohawk Gateway | publisher = American Historical Press | author = Thomas Phelan and P. Thomas Carroll | ISBN = 1-892724-17-0 | page = 22 | accessdate = 2010-01-20 | year = 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Erie Canal|Erie]] and [[Champlain Canal]]s were begun in 1817, and the section in Cohoes finished in 1823, and had a significant impact in Cohoes. Cohoes was even known as Juncta because of this. Every farm in Cohoes was crossed by one or both of the canals, and Cohoes was the site of the junction of the two canals.&lt;ref name=Masten/&gt; Even with the canals and the bridge bringing easier access to larger markets, Cohoes was a sleepy place to be in prior to 1831.  The nearest post office was at Waterford and fresh meat and groceries were a luxury hard to come by in Cohoes.&lt;ref name=Masten/&gt; A post office in Cohoes was finally built in 1831.&lt;ref name=Masten/&gt;

In 1811 the Cohoes Manufacturing Company, owned entirely by men from Lansingburg, was incorporated and began a factory for making screws.  This would be the first use of large industry in Cohoes and the harnessing of the Mohawk River and Cohoes Falls for power.&lt;ref name=page22/&gt;

In 1831, a [[dam]] was constructed on the Mohawk River above the city's waterfall by the new Cohoes Company.  It was soon swept away by ice, and a new one was built the following year. Two canals from the dam provided power for industry.&lt;ref name=Masten/&gt; Originally ironworks were the main industry calling Cohoes home; in this it was similar to Troy, [[Menands, New York|Menands]], and West Troy. Daniel Simmons' Simmons Axe Company was famous throughout the United States, and the Cohoes Iron Foundry was a large business enterprise in the 1830s. Cotton, however, would be the future of Cohoes. It had a small start in the 1820s when the only cotton mill in Albany County was located in Cohoes. Egberts and Bailey was the first factory to use knitting machinery run by power thanks to the Cohoes Company's power canals.&lt;ref name=Masten/&gt; This provided power to make the community a leading textile center with the establishment in 1836 of the Harmony Manufacturing Company, later famous as [[Harmony Mills]]. Cohoes became a [[mill town]], and to an extent a [[company town]]. During the 1870s the mills were enormously profitable because of the [[Erie Canal]], which flowed past them at that time. Mill #3, at over {{convert|1000|ft|m}} long, has been considered the longest continuous textile mill in the country at the time. In 1848, Cohoes was incorporated as a [[Administrative divisions of New York#Village|village]] within the [[Administrative divisions of New York#Town|town]] of [[Watervliet (town), New York|Watervliet]], and in 1869 chartered as a city.

[[Image:Cohoes1891.jpg|thumb|left|Map of Cohoes in 1891]]
In 1866, during excavation work for construction of Mill #3 of the Harmony Mills, the bones of a [[mastodon]] were unearthed over a period of several weeks.  The Cohoes Mastodon skeleton was on display in the lobby of the [[New York State Museum]] in [[Albany, New York]], but has recently been moved to a new location away from the windows of the lobby, where temperature and humidity fluctuations risked damaging the skeleton, to a new display near the rear of the museum.  A furry replica can be seen at the Cohoes Public Library.

The 19th century saw an influx of immigrants to Cohoes to work in the mills, particularly [[French Canadian]]s from [[Quebec]], and [[Irish people|Irish]].

Around the start of the 20th century, daredevil [[Bobby Leach]] practiced going over the Cohoes Falls in a barrel before he performed the same stunt at Niagara. Cohoes residents watched this feat from the lawn or the porch of The Cataract House, the Victorian hotel at the corner of North Mohawk and School Streets, site of the present School Street Power Station.

'''Ogdensburg''' is a [[City (New York)|city]] in [[St. Lawrence County]], [[New York]], [[United States]].  The population was 11,128 at the 2010 census.  In the late 18th century, European-American settlers named the community after American land owner and developer Samuel Ogden.

The '''City of Ogdensburg''' is at the northern border of New York, at the mouth of the [[Oswegatchie River]], on the south bank of the [[Saint Lawrence River|St. Lawrence River]]. It is the only formally designated city in Saint Lawrence County.

The Port of Ogdensburg is the only [[United States|U.S.]] port on the [[St. Lawrence Seaway]]. [[Ogdensburg International Airport]] is located south of the city. The [[Ogdensburg–Prescott International Bridge]], northeast of the city, links the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].

==History==
This was ancient territory of [[indigenous peoples]] of varying cultures. By 1000 CE, Iroquoian-speaking people were settling along the St. Lawrence River and practicing agriculture, as well as hunting and fishing. Since the 1950s, [[historians]], [[linguists]], and [[archeologists]] have found evidence of a distinct people, the [[St. Lawrence Iroquoians]], who inhabited the areas along the St. Lawrence River from before 1300 until the late 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3683/is_199801/ai_n8760719/ James F.

(1998). &quot;The Confusing Identities Attributed to Stadacona and Hochelaga&quot;], ''Journal of Canadian Studies'', Volume 32, p. 149, accessed 3 Feb 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  They spoke [[Laurentian language|Laurentian]] and were a group distinct from the later historical five and Six Nations of the [[Iroquois]] ''[[Haudenosaunee]]''. By the late 16th century, this people disappeared from the St. Lawrence Valley, probably due to warfare by the [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]] over the [[fur trade]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=T3NQ1lsaHs0C&amp;pg=PA214&amp;lpg=PA214&amp;dq=The+Disappearance+of+the+St.+Lawrence+Iroquoians&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tq1jiNS2sf&amp;sig=Z6z2g4fSPdAjHTc1KhG1dC-b8l8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=CVdoS7jbAoWjnQfIv6CsBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CBoQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Disappearance%20of%20the%20St.%20Lawrence%20Iroquoians&amp;f=false Bruce G. Trigger, &quot;The Disappearance of the St. Lawrence Iroquoians&quot;], in ''The Children of Aataenstic: A History of the Huron People to 1660'', vol. 2], Montreal and London: Mcgill-Queen's University Press, 1976, pp. 214-218, 220-224, accessed 2 Feb 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time of later French contact, for instance in the early 17th century with [[Samuel de Champlain]], the Five Nations of the ''[[Haudenosaunee]]'': [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]], [[Onondaga people|Onondaga]], [[Oneida tribe|Oneida]], [[Cayuga people|Cayuga]], and [[Seneca nation|Seneca]], were allied in the [[Iroquois Confederacy]], based in present-day [[New York]].  Onondaga settlements extended up along the south shore of [[Lake Ontario]]. Both the Huron and Mohawk used the St. Lawrence Valley for [[hunting]] grounds and as a path for war parties.

The earliest European settlement in the area was a French [[mission (Christian)|mission]], built by [[François Picquet|Abbé Picquet]] in 1749. Located near the mouth of the ''[[Oswegatchie River|Fleuve Oswegache]]'' (Oswegatchie River), he named it [[Fort de La Présentation]] (Fort of the [[Presentation of Mary|Presentation]]). The mission attracted [[Native Americans in the United States|natives]] for the [[fur trade]], many of whom settled in the village and [[converted]] to [[Catholicism]]. Mostly [[Onondaga people|Onondaga]], the converted Iroquois at the mission became known as [[Oswegatchie (tribe)|Oswegatchie]].

By 1755, there were 3,000 Iroquois living at the mission settlement. By comparison, [[Montreal]] had only 4,000 residents at the time. Oswegatchie was one of the [[Seven Nations of Canada]]. The residents were hostile to the encroachments of British colonists on their territory. During the 1750s and the [[Seven Years War]], warriors from this fort were allied with French officers in attacking British colonists in the Champlain, Mohawk and Ohio valleys.&lt;ref name=&quot;History of the Fort&quot;&gt;[http://www.fortlapresentation.net/history.htm &quot;History of the Fort&quot;], Fort La Presentation Association, accessed 2 Feb 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The city is near the site of the 1760 [[Battle of the Thousand Islands]] between British and French forces during the [[Seven Years War]] (also known in the US as the [[French and Indian War]].) After the British victory, France ceded its land in Canada to England. The English renamed the installation Fort Oswegatchie, after the native name for the river (as it sounded in French). As with the other mission settlements, the British did not disturb the relationship of the Oswegatchie and their Catholic priests. This became part of Lower Canada or [[Quebec]] province. The village remained under British rule until 1796 following the [[American Revolutionary War]]. With the northern border redefined by [[Jay's Treaty]], the settlement became part of United States territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;History of the Fort&quot;/&gt;

The first settlers under a United States flag arrived that year. United States settlers essentially drove the Oswegatchie, former British allies, out of the area; many went to [[Akwesasne]] or other Mohawk reserves in Canada.

New American residents named the village Ogdensburgh after [[Samuel Ogden]], an early landowner. The community developed around this early settlement and was designated the county seat from 1802 to 1828. During the [[War of 1812]], the city was [[Battle of Ogdensburg|captured by British forces]] to end the partial blockade on the St. Lawrence River and harassment conducted from the community. Local merchants used the absence of United States troops to conduct extensive trade with [[Canada]].

The community was incorporated as a village in 1817. Unlike [[Plattsburgh, New York|Plattsburgh]], it removed the &quot;h&quot; in the spelling of its name. The locale became the City of Ogdensburg in 1868.

Ogdensburg was an important trading city and station in the development of [[railroads]] in northern New York and southeastern Canada; the [[Ogdensburg and Lake Champlain Railroad|Ogdensburg &amp; Lake Champlain Railroad]] (later [[Rutland Railroad]]) (1849), [[Rome, Watertown and Ogdensburg Railroad|Rome, Watertown &amp; Ogdensburg Railroad]] (1853) and [[Portland and Ogdensburg Railway|Portland &amp; Ogdensburg Railway]] (never completed), all involved lines through the area.

In 1940 the town was the site of the signing of the [[Ogdensburg Agreement]] between [[Prime Minister of Canada|Canadian Prime Minister]] [[Mackenzie King]] and [[United States President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. This renewed the ties between the two countries after the 1939 outbreak of [[World War II]] in Europe. The celebrated [[Germany|German]] [[POW]] [[Franz von Werra]] escaped from Canada to Ogdensburg in a rowboat.

The [[Library Park Historic District (Ogdensburg, New York)|Library Park Historic District]], [[Judge John Fine House]], [[Acker and Evans Law Office]], [[New York State Armory (Ogdensburg)|New York State Armory]], [[Oswegatchie Pumping Station]], [[Ogdensburg Armory]], [[Robert C. McEwen United States Custom House]], [[United States Post Office (Ogdensburg, New York)|United States Post Office]], and [[Fort de La Présentation|Fort de La Présentation Site]] are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nris&quot;&gt;{{NRISref|2009a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
The following schools are in the city of Ogdensburg:
*[[Ogdensburg Free Academy]]
*John F. Kennedy Elementary
*Grant C. Madill Elementary
*SMDA (private)

==Resources==
Ogdensburg is home to the St. Lawrence Psychiatric Center, a [[mental health]] service provider offering both inpatient and outpatient services. The SLPC is part of the New York State Office of Mental Health (OMH) and serves the general public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.omh.ny.gov/omhweb/facilities/slpc/facility.htm St. Lawrence Psychiatric Center website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Two private educational institutions, now closed, were formerly located in Ogdensburg. After [[Mater Dei College (New York)|Mater Dei College]] closed, its campus was occupied from 2001 to 2009 by [[Academy at Ivy Ridge]]. The privately operated [[boarding school]] enrolled teenagers with behavioral issues.

The Ogdensburg Public Library provides services including, but not limited to, free internet services, (wi-fi and computers that can be borrowed), as well as seven-day DVD and Blu-ray rentals, books, audiobooks and much more. There are services provided for teens, children and adults.

The city is the site of the [[Frederic Remington Art Museum]]. The downtown museum is housed in the former family mansion of local industrialist [[David Parish]] on Washington Street. While the house was always called the Parish Mansion, Eva Remington lived there as a widow after the death of her husband Frederic Remington. He was notable for his paintings of the [[American West]]. The collection of Remington art and memorabilia is based on items from the estates of Eva Remington and her sister Emma.

The Fort La Presentation Association has been organized to reconstruct and operate the mission fort as a [[living history]] museum. They intend to use it as a basis for education and [[heritage tourism]], as well as an appreciation for the diverse history and peoples of the area.

Ogdensburg is the site of two [[prison|correctional facilities]]: [[Riverview Correctional Facility|Riverview]] and [[Ogdensburg Correctional Facility|Ogdensburg]]. Run by the [[New York State Department of Correctional Services]], the facilities provide jobs for local residents. One is located on the grounds of the former St. Lawrence Psychiatric Center. The other was built directly across [[New York State Route 37]].

Ogdensburg has become a cross-border shipping center due to Canadians ordering goods on the internet and having them delivered to package receiving companies in Ogdensburg, and then driving to Ogdensburg to bring the items into Canada themselves. Often this is due to U.S. companies offering web shopping but not shipping to Canada or charging a much higher price for items (or shipping charges) being sent to Canada. Businesses also warehouse their materials in Ogdensburg for shipping to locations in the U.S. and overseas.

==Events==

* The Ogdensburg Boys &amp; Girls Club Expo is held on the 3rd weekend in March, and is one of the main fundraisers for that organization.

* The last full week in July is the occasion of the annual Ogdensburg International Seaway Festival.  Among the events of the week are the Remington Canoe Race, a local Battle of the High School Bands competition, craft shows, a classic car show, and many other events.  The festival ends with a fireworks show on Friday night and a parade on Saturday morning.

==Notable People==
*[[George R. Malby]], former US Congressman

The region is known for many acclaimed universities, and several of them (notably the [[University of Rochester]] and the [[Rochester Institute of Technology]]) are nationally renowned for their research programs. In addition, Rochester has been and continues to be the site of many important inventions and innovations in consumer products. The Rochester area is currently home to corporations such as [[Eastman Kodak|Kodak]], [[Bausch &amp; Lomb]] and [[Xerox]] that conduct extensive research and manufacturing in the fields of industrial and consumer products. The Rochester metropolitan area is the second largest regional economy in New York State according to the U.S. [[Internal Revenue Service]], after the [[New York metropolitan area|New York City metropolitan area]].&lt;ref&gt;Daneman, Matthew, [http://www.democratandchronicle.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080302/BUSINESS/803020356 &quot;Our manufacturing roots sprout jobs&quot;], ''Democrat and Chronicle'' (March 2, 2008) ([http://www.rochesterbusinessalliance.com/core/contentmanager/uploads/0302%20Manufacturing%20DANDC.pdf archived copy])&lt;/ref&gt;

Rochester was ranked as the first 'most livable city' among 379 [[Metropolitan statistical area|U.S. metropolitan areas]] in the 25th edition (2007) of the ''Places Rated Almanac.''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.visitrochester.com/includes/media/docs/Facts_on_Rochester.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://placesrated.com/|title=Places Rated Almanac|first=David|last=Savageau|publisher=Places Rated Books|edition=25th Anniversary Edition|year=2007|isbn=0-9793199-0-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Rochester, New York metropolitan area|Rochester area]] also received the top ranking for overall quality of life among U.S. metros with populations of more than 1 million in a 2007 study by ''Expansion Management'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expansionmanagement.com/smo/articleviewer/default.asp?cmd=articledetail&amp;articleid=18836&amp;st=5 2007 QUALITY OF LIFE QUOTIENT: What Really Matters Is Not the Salary, But What That Salary Will Buy], Expansion Management&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expansionmanagement.com/smo/DocReserve/DocReserve_Content/Overall%20LARGE.pdf &quot;Overall Quality of Life: Metros With Population Over 1 Million&quot;], ''Expansion Management''&lt;/ref&gt; In the same study, ''Expansion Management'' rated the area's public schools as sixth best nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expansionmanagement.com/smo/DocReserve/DocReserve_Content/1a-Large%20Metros.pdf Best Metrowide Public Schools], Expansion Management&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 ''[[Forbes]]'' rated Rochester as the third best place to raise a family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.forbes.com/2010/06/04/best-places-family-lifestyle-real-estate-cities-kids.html|title=America's Best Places to Raise a Family|publisher=Forbes.com|first=Francesca|last=Levy|date=2010-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 Kiplinger rated Rochester as the fifth best city for families, citing low cost of living, top public schools, and a low jobless rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kiplinger.com/slideshow/best-cities-families-kpfm/2.html |title=Best Cities for Families |publisher=Kiplinger |date= |accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Seneca tribe of Native Americans lived in the area in and around Rochester until they gave up their claim to most of this land in the [[Treaty of Big Tree]] in 1797.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Oklahoma State University Library |url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/vol2/treaties/sen1027.htm |title=Treaty of Big Tree |publisher=Digital.library.okstate.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Settlement before the Seneca tribe is unknown.

Development of modern Rochester followed the [[American Revolution]], and forced cession of their territory by the [[Iroquois]] after the defeat of Great Britain. Allied with the British, four major Iroquois tribes were essentially forced from New York.  As a reward for their loyalty to the British Crown, they were given a large [[Haldimand Proclamation|land grant]] on the [[Grand River (Ontario)|Grand River]] in Canada.

On November 8, 1803, Col. [[Nathaniel Rochester]] (1752–1831), Maj. Charles Carroll, and Col. William Fitzhugh, Jr. (1761–1839), all of [[Hagerstown, Maryland]], purchased a 100-acre (ca. 40 [[hectare|ha]]) tract from the state in Western New York along the [[Genesee River]]. They chose the site because its three [[Waterfall#Types of waterfalls|cataracts]] on the Genesee offered great potential for water power. Beginning in 1811, and with a population of 15, the three founders surveyed the land and laid out streets and tracts. In 1817, the Brown brothers and other landowners joined their lands with the Hundred Acre Tract to form the village of Rochesterville.

[[File:Rochester NY Broad Street Bridge 2002.jpeg|thumb|left|Bridge originally built as an aqueduct for the [[Erie Canal]] in 1842, replacing the original construction from 1823. It was subsequently used for subway trains and, in the 1920s, the Broad Street Bridge was erected on top of it. This photograph shows how it appeared in 2002.]]

By 1821, Rochesterville was the seat of Monroe County. In 1823, Rochesterville consisted of {{convert|1012|acre|km2|0}} and 2,500 residents, and the Village of Rochesterville became known as Rochester. Also in 1823, the [[Erie Canal]] aqueduct over the Genesee River was completed, and the Erie Canal east to the [[Hudson River]] was opened. (In the early 20th century, after the advent of [[Rail transport|railroad]]s, the presence of the canal in the center city was an obstacle; it was re-routed south of Rochester.) By 1830, Rochester's population was 9,200 and in 1834, it was re-chartered as a city.

Rochester was first known as &quot;The Young Lion of the West&quot;, and then as the &quot;Flour City&quot;. By 1838, Rochester was the largest flour-producing city in the United States. Having doubled its population in only ten years, Rochester became America's first &quot;[[boomtown]]&quot;. Rochester experienced one of the nation's biggest revivalist movements, led by Charles Finney.

By the mid-19th century, as the center of the wheat-processing industry moved west with population and agriculture, the city became home to an expanding [[Plant nursery|nursery]] business, giving rise to the city's second [[nickname]], the &quot;Flower City.&quot; Large and small nurseries ringed the city, the most famous of which was started in 1840 by immigrants Georg Ellwanger from Germany and Patrick Barry from Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Blake McKelvey, [http://www.rochester.lib.ny.us/%7Erochhist/v20_1958/v20i1.pdf &quot;The Germans of Rochester: Their Traditions and Contributions&quot;], ''Rochester History]'', Vol. 20, No. 1 (January 1958), pp. 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1847, [[Frederick Douglass]] founded the [[Abolitionism|abolitionist]] newspaper ''[[North Star (anti-slavery newspaper)|The North Star]]'' in Rochester. Douglass, a former slave and an antislavery speaker and writer, gained a circulation of over 4,000 readers in the United States, Europe and the Caribbean. The ''North Star'' served as a forum for abolitionist views. The Douglass home burnt down in 1872, but a marker for it can be found in Highland Park off South Avenue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.rochester.edu/class/douglass/part5.html &quot;Frederick Douglass&quot;], History, University of Rochester&lt;/ref&gt; The city was also home to [[Susan B. Anthony]], an abolitionist who became active in the [[women's rights]] movement. At the end of the 19th century, anarchist [[Emma Goldman]] lived and worked in Rochester for several years, where she championed the cause of labor in Rochester sweatshops. Rochester was also home to significant unrest in labor, race, and antiwar protests.

After the Civil War, Rochester had an expansion of new industries in the late 19th century, founded by migrants to the city, such as inventor and entrepreneur [[George Eastman]], who founded [[Eastman Kodak]], and German immigrants [[John Jacob Bausch]] and [[Henry Lomb]], who combined technical and financial expertise to launch [[Bausch &amp; Lomb]] in 1861. Not only did they create new industries and thousands of jobs, but Eastman became a major [[Philanthropy|philanthropist]], developing and endowing the [[University of Rochester]], its [[Eastman School of Music]] and other local institutions.

In the early 20th century, Rochester became a center of the garment industry, particularly men's fashions. It was the base of enterprises such as [[Bond Clothing Stores]], [[Fashion Park Clothes]], [[Hickey Freeman]], and Stein-Bloch &amp; Co. The [[carriage]] maker James Cunningham and Sons founded a pioneer [[automobile]] company -  Cunningham.&lt;ref&gt;Like many early companies, its production was small, about 400 a year including [[hearse]]s, designed by [[Volney Lacey]]. [[G.N. Georgano]] ''Cars: Early and Vintage, 1886–1930''. (London: Grange-Universal, 1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

The population reached 62,386 in 1870, 162,608 in 1900 and 295,750 in 1920. By 1950, the population had reached a high of 332,488. In 1950, the Census Bureau reported Rochester's population as 97.6% white and 2.3% black.&lt;ref name=&quot;census1&quot; &gt;{{cite web|title=New York - Race and Hispanic Origin for Selected Cities and Other Places: Earliest Census to 1990|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|url=http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html|accessdate=May 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; With industrial restructuring in the later 20th century, and the decline of industry and jobs in the area, by 2010, the population had declined to 210,565 in the city, although the metropolitan area was considerably larger.

Rochester's geography was formed by the [[ice sheet]]s during the [[Pleistocene]] epoch. The retreating ice sheets reached a standstill at what is now the southern border of the city, melting at the same rate as they were advancing, depositing sediment along the southern edge of the ice mass. This created a line of hills, including (from west to east) Mt. Hope, the hills of Highland Park, Pinnacle Hill, and Cobb's Hill. Because the sediment of these hills was deposited into a proglacial lake, they are stratified and classified as a &quot;[[Kame|kame delta]]&quot;. A brief retreat and readvance of the ice sheet onto the delta deposited unstratified material there, creating a rare hybrid structure called a &quot;[[Moraine|kame moraine]]&quot;.

The ice sheets also created [[Lake Ontario]] (one of the five fresh-water [[Great Lakes]]), the [[Glacial geology of the Genesee River|Genesee River]] with its [[waterfall]]s and [[Canyon|gorge]]s, [[Irondequoit Bay]], [[Sodus Bay]], [[Braddock Bay]], [[Mendon Ponds Park|Mendon Ponds]], numerous local streams and ponds, the Ridge, and the nearby [[Finger Lakes]].

According to the City of Rochester, the city has {{convert|537|mi|km}} of public streets, {{convert|585|mi|km}} of water mains, 44 vehicular and eight pedestrian bridges, 11 public libraries, two police stations (one for the east side, one for the west), and 15 firehouses. The principal source of water is [[Hemlock Lake]], which, with its watershed, is owned by the state of New York. Other water sources include [[Canadice Lake]] and [[Lake Ontario]]. The 30-year annual average snowfall is just above {{convert|100|in|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name = NOAA/&gt; The monthly daily average ranges from {{convert|24.7|°F|1}} in January to {{convert|70.8|°F|1}} in July. The high amount of snow that Rochester receives can be accounted for by the city's proximity to [[Lake Ontario]] (see [[Lake-effect snow|lake effect]]).

Rochester lies in the [[humid continental climate]] zone ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Dfb'')&lt;ref&gt;Peel, M. C., Finlayson, B. L., and McMahon, T. A.: [[Media:Americas Koppen Map.png|Updated world map of the Köppen-Geiger climate classification]], Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 11, 1633–1644, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and has four distinct seasons, with cold and snowy winters; temperatures drop to {{convert|0|°F|0}} on 4.2 nights annually. Autumn features brilliant foliage colors, and summer sees generally comfortable temperatures that usually stay in the range of {{convert|80|to|85|°F|°C}} accompanied by moderate to high humidity; there are only 6.9 days annually of highs more than {{convert|90|°F|0}}. Precipitation is plentiful year round.

==Economy==
{{See also|Rochester, New York metropolitan area#Economy}}
Rochester is home to a number of declining Fortune 1000 and international businesses, including [[Eastman Kodak]], as well as several national and regional companies, such as [[Bausch &amp; Lomb]]. [[Xerox]] was founded in Rochester in 1906 as The Haloid Company,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xerox.com/go/xrx/template/019d.jsp?view=Factbook&amp;id=XAG&amp;Xcntry=USA&amp;Xlang=en_US |title=Xerox Corporation Fact Book: Company facts, history, information |publisher=Xerox.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and retains a significant presence in Rochester, although its headquarters are now located in [[Norwalk, Connecticut]]. The [[Gannett Company|Gannett]] newspaper company and [[Western Union]] were founded in Rochester by [[Frank Gannett]] and [[Hiram Sibley]] respectively but have since moved to other cities.

Because of the high prevalence of imaging and optical science among the industry and the universities, Rochester is known as the world capital of imaging. [[The Institute of Optics]] of the [[University of Rochester]] and the [[Rochester Institute of Technology]] in nearby [[Henrietta, New York|Henrietta]] both have imaging programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imaging.org/ist/resources/education.cfm#university The Society for Imaging Science and Technology], The Society for Imaging Science and Technology website&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the University of Rochester became the largest employer in the Rochester area, surpassing Kodak.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rochester.edu/aboutus/connections/development.html Economic Development], University of Rochester &quot;Connections&quot; website&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food and beverage===

[[File:Nick Tahou's Garbage Plate.JPG|thumb|A [[white hot]] [[Nick Tahou Hots|garbage plate]].]]
One food product that Rochester calls its own is the &quot;[[white hot]]&quot;, a variant of the [[hot dog]] or smoked [[bratwurst]] made by the local [[Zweigle's]] company and other companies. Another local specialty is the &quot;garbage plate,&quot; first served at [[Nick Tahou Hots]] and traditionally includes home fries, mac salad, meat sauce, onions, mustard and choice of hot dog or hamburger. Many area restaurants feature copies or variations of the &quot;garbage plate&quot; but cannot call it such because of trademarks.

===Neighborhood Service Centers===
Enforcement of property code violations in Rochester had been handled by the Neighborhood Empowerment Team, or NET. Rather than utilizing a centralized code-enforcement office, 10 sectors in Rochester were assigned a total of six NET offices by the city government. However, there had been complaints about the lack of consistency in the manner and severity of enforcement between NET offices. On July 16, 2008, the city announced that two of the NET offices would be closed and another relocated, due to what it had found to be the high cost and low value of operating the decentralized network.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publicbroadcasting.net/wxxi/news.newsmain?action=article&amp;ARTICLE_ID=1301376&amp;sectionID=1 City Begins NET Consolidation], WXXI - June 17, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the restructuring, the remaining offices were renamed Neighborhood Service Centers, or NSCs.  There is now one office per city quadrant which resolve quality of life issues, work with neighborhood groups, and pave the way for appropriate housing and economic development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityofrochester.gov/article.aspx?id=8589939519] Neighborhood Service Centers&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of code enforcement processes were consolidated into the Bureau of Inspection and Compliance within the Department of Neighborhood and Business Development located centrally in City Hall.

Anthony], University-Atlantic,  [http://www.uppermonroeavenue.org/ Upper Monroe], and more are all recognized communities with various neighborhood associations. There are also living spaces in [[Downtown Rochester]].

====14621 community====
Extending across much of the north-central cityscape of Rochester, now including parts of the old Hudson Avenue and North Clinton neighborhoods, is the 14621 community. Today this neighborhood is predominantly African American and Hispanic, this community suffered being the center of the 1964 riots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rochester_1964_race_riot |title=1964 Rochester race riot - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia |publisher=En.wikipedia.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/independentlens/july64/timeline.html |title=Independent Lens . JULY '64 . Timeline |publisher=PBS |date= |accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The riots did produce some benefits in the long run: the north-central area has been the site of ongoing urban renewal projects since the late 1960s, and, as noted by ''JULY ’64'' filmmakers Carvin Eison and Chris Christopher, inspired the development of such important African American organizations such as The Urban League of Rochester as well as Rochester’s first anti-poverty organization (Action for a Better Community), and black community activist organization Freedom, Integration, God, Honor, Today (F.I.G.H.T.) founded by Rev. Franklin Florence and Deleon McEwen, the latter was its first president. The establishment of this program came through the assistance of [[Saul Alinsky]]. The neighborhood is still considered the most dangerous part of Rochester and is blighted by crime, drugs and gang activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/independentlens/july64/qa.html |title=Independent Lens .

====Lyell Avenue====

====19th Ward====
The 19th Ward is a southwest neighborhood bordered by Genesee Street, West Avenue, the Erie Canal, and is across the river from the University of Rochester.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.19wca.org |title=19th Ward Community Association |publisher=19wca.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Now known by its slogan &quot;Urban by Choice,&quot; in the early 19th century the area was known as Castle Town, after Castle Inn, a tavern run by [[Colonel]] Isaac Castle. By the early 1820s however, the area became overshadowed by developments in the north that would later become downtown Rochester. Due to a tumultuous bend in the Genesee river, the area was home to skilled boatsmen that assisted boats traveling north to Rochester and the area was consequently known during this time as &quot;The Rapids&quot;. In the 1890s, as Rochester expanded, the area became a prosperous residential area that thrived as the city grew. By 1930 it was a booming residential area for doctors, lawyers, and skilled workers; it includes the still prestigious Sibley Tract development. Homes in the originally upper-class neighborhood typically have gumwood trim, leaded glass, fireplaces, hardwood floors, and open porches. In the 1960s, property values declined as the population of Rochester did, the area experienced [[white flight]] accelerated by school busing, [[blockbusting]], and [[List of ethnic riots|race riot]]s downtown, and crime increased, with violence, [[Substance abuse|drug use]], and neglected property further diminishing property values.&lt;ref&gt;Rochester's 19th Ward. 2005. Michael Leavy and Glenn Leavy.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 19th Ward has had an active community association since 1965, and is known for its ethnic, class, and cultural diversity.{{Vague|date=April 2009}} The current &quot;Brooks Landing&quot; development is successfully bringing new economic development to the community including an 88-room hotel, {{convert|20000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} office building, {{convert|11000|sqft|m2}} of new retail, and Boulder Coffee shop.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rochestercitynewspaper.com/archives/2004/4/Sticking+it+to+the+19th+Ward&lt;/ref&gt;

It is home to Ontario Beach Park, commonly known as Charlotte Beach, which is a popular summer destination for Rochesterians.

There are two neighborhood associations within North Winton Village. The North Winton Village Neighborhood Association, founded 15 years ago, joins businesses and residents together for the greater good. Its major goals include “neighborhood preservation, beautification, pride in home ownership and patronization of neighborhood businesses.” Their motto: &quot;Live, Shop and Beautify North Winton Village.” In 2011, residents in an area bounded by Culver Road, East Main Street, Cedarwood Terrace and Jersey Street joined together to create The North East Main Neighbors United (NEMNU).Today, NEMNU’s mission is to maintain, improve, and enhance the quality of life in the neighborhood by addressing safety issues, providing social activities, communicating with residents and local government, promoting beautification projects, linking needs with resource opportunities, and developing cooperative efforts with businesses and neighborhood groups.

This neighborhood is a Preservation District on the National Register of Historic Places, known as the [[Madison Square-West Main Street Historic District]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nrhpinv_ny2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=4182|title=National Register of Historic Places Registration: Madison Square-West Main Street Historic District|date=September 1988|accessdate=2009-09-01 |author=Kathleen LaFrank|publisher=[[New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It encompasses a three-and-one-half block area within walking distance from downtown Rochester, and comprises residential, commercial and industrial buildings. The center of the residential area is Susan B. Anthony Square, a {{convert|0.84|acre|m2|adj=on}} park shown on [[city map]]s from 1839, which was designed by the famous Olmstead Brothers. Also within the neighborhood is the [[Susan B. Anthony House]], which was the suffragist’s residence for the last decades of her life, now a museum, as well as the Cunningham Carriage factory built in 1848 on Canal Street. James Cunningham Son &amp; Co. sold more carriages in the United States in the 1880s than all other manufacturers combined. The Canal Street property, which still stands, remained Cunningham's headquarters for more than 100 years.

====Swillburg====
This wedge-shaped piece of the city is bordered by S. Clinton Avenue on the west, Field St on the south, and Interstate 490 on the east.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swillburg.com/pdfs/swillburg%20neighborhood%20map.pdf ]{{dead link|date=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The neighborhood received its moniker when a 19th-century Rochester pig farmer utilized the area to collect swill for his swine. The neighborhood association humorously honors its roots by using street signs featuring the Swillburg Pig. The area has one of the highest rates of homeownership in the city and is currently undergoing gentrification as well.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

The local elementary school is #35, Field Street, which often sponsors a community garden in its courtyard on Pinnacle Street.

====Marketview Heights====
Running east from Union Street just north of Main Street, Marketview Heights is best known as the location of the Public Market, which offers a variety of groceries and other goods from marketeers from farms and shops from surrounding areas, primarily on the weekends.

====Homestead Heights====
Homestead Heights is located in northeast Rochester. It is bordered on the west by Goodman Street, on the north by Clifford Avenue, on the south by Bay Street, and on the east by Culver Road, which is also the border between the city and the town of Irondequoit. The neighborhood is a mix of residential and commercial. Real estate values are higher on the eastern end of the neighborhood near the Irondequoit border. The neighborhood is approximately 2–2{{frac|1|4}} miles west of the [[Irondequoit Bay]].

==Education==
The City of Rochester is served by the [[Rochester City School District]] which encompasses all public primary and secondary education. The district is governed by a popularly elected seven-member Board of Education. There are also parochial and private primary and secondary schools located within the city. Rochester City Schools consistently post below-average results when compared to the rest of New York State, although on-time graduation rates have improved significantly during the past three years.  That being said, the high school graduation rate for African American males is lower in Rochester than in any city in the United States (9%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zillow.com/school/NY-Rochester/Rochester-City-School-District-13755/ |title=Rochester's Best Schools: Ratings, Reviews, and Grades - Zillow School Information |publisher=Zillow.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charter schools in the city include [[Rochester Academy Charter School]].

There are four institutions that began operations in the city, but subsequently moved to Rochester's inner-ring suburbs:
*The [[Empire State College]] Rochester Learning Center moved from its Prince Street address to [[Irondequoit, New York|Irondequoit]] in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.esc.edu/genesee-valley/locations/rochester/ | title = Empire State College in Rochester | publisher = [[Empire State College]] | location = [[Saratoga Springs, New York]] | accessdate = 2011-12-21 | quote = In 1999, the center moved from Prince Street to 1475 Winton Road North, where it celebrates 30 years of service, of excellence and innovation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rochester's colleges are all part of the [[Rochester Area Colleges]] consortium.

Rochester was host of the [[Barleywood Female University]], a short-lived women's college from 1852 to 1853.  The Lutheran seminary that became [[Wagner College]] was established in the city in 1883 and remained for some 35 years before moving to Staten Island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = College graduates fuel Rochester’s fame | url = http://www.democratandchronicle.com/article/20100424/NEWS0202/4240317/College-graduates-fuel-Rochester-s-fame | newspaper = [[Democrat and Chronicle]] | location = Rochester, New York | issn = 1088-5153 | date = 2010-04-24 | accessdate = 2013-07-04 | quote = What is now Staten Island’s Wagner College was founded in Rochester in 1883 as the Lutheran Proseminary.

The university is also home to the [[Eastman School of Music]], which was ranked the number one music school in America. It was founded and endowed by [[George Eastman]] in his years as a [[Philanthropy|philanthropist]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rochester.edu/news/show.php?id=2230 &quot;University of Rochester Rises in U.S. News Rankings&quot;], University of Rochester Press Releases&lt;/ref&gt; He also contributed greatly to the University of Rochester from wealth based on the success of [[Eastman Kodak]].

==Culture and recreation==
[[File:Rochester - Little Theatre.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Little Theatre (Rochester, New York)|Little Theatre]] on East Avenue]] [[File:Rochester Contemporary Art Center Opening Reception.jpg|thumb|right|Rochester Contemporary Art Center]]The city of Rochester is home to numerous cultural institutions. These include the [[Garth Fagan]] Dance, the [[Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra]], [[George Eastman House]] International Museum of Photography and Film, [[Memorial Art Gallery]], [[Rochester Contemporary Art Center]], Rochester Museum &amp; Science Center, the [[Rochester Broadway Theater League]], [[The National Museum of Play|Strong National Museum of Play]], the [[Strasenburgh Planetarium]], [[Hochstein School of Music and Dance]], and numerous arts organizations. [[Geva Theatre Center]] is the city's largest professional theatre.

The East End Theater is located on East Main Street in the theater district. The [http://www.rapaonline.us Rochester Association of Performing Arts] is a non-profit organization that provides educational theater classes to the community.

===Nightlife===
Rochester's East End district, located downtown, is well known as the center of the city's nightlife. It is the stopping point for East Avenue, which along with the surrounding streets is crowded with nightclubs, lounges, coffee shops, bars, and high-end restaurants. The [[Eastman School of Music]], one of the top musical institutes in the nation, and its auditorium are also located within the neighborhood. The [[Eastman Theatre]] now plays host to the Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra and other musical/drama events.

There are other, smaller enclaves of after-hours activity scattered across the city. Southeast is the heart of Rochester's thriving arts scene, particularly in and around the Park Avenue neighborhood (which is known for its many coffee shops, cafes, bistros and boutique shopes). Nearby on University Avenue can be found several plazas like the Village Gate which give space to trendy bars, restaurants and art galleries that stay open late into the night. Monroe Avenue, several streets over, is packed with pubs, small restaurants, smoke shops, theaters and several clubs as well as cigar bars and hookah lounges. All of these neighborhoods are home to many artists, musicians, students and Rochester's large LGBT community.

The South Wedge district, located directly below downtown, has seen significant gentrification in recent years and now is the site of many trendy cafes and bars that serve the student community attending the [[University of Rochester]] several blocks away from the heart of the neighborhoods. The wedge is quickly becoming one of the most vibrant areas within the city limits, its numerous nightspots keeping the streets busy with college students and young professionals (many of whom live there due to the abundance of affordable housing, thriving nightlife and proximity to many of the region's major hospitals, parks and colleges)

===Park lands===

Among cities in North America with at least seven current professional teams, Rochester was determined in 2007 to be the only one whose teams all had cumulative winning regular season records.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Bob Matthews Sports Column, July 21, 2007|url=http://www.democratandchronicle.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070721/SPORTS0101/707210319/1007/SPORTS|publisher=Democrat and Chronicle|date=2007-07-21|accessdate=2007-07-21 }}{{Dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Rochester Red Wings]]  baseball club, the AAA affiliate of the [[Minnesota Twins]], play in the [[International League]]. The [[Rochester Americans]] [[ice hockey]] team, the [[American Hockey League|AHL]] affiliate for the [[National Hockey League|NHL]] [[Buffalo Sabres]], are known as the &quot;Amerks&quot;. The [[Rochester Rhinos]]  [[Association football|soccer]]  club have played for many years in the [[USL First Division]], which is the second-highest level American soccer league.
[[File:Frontier Field 2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Frontier Field]], including the Rochester skyline to the southeast.]]

[[Lacrosse]] has seen some popularity in Rochester. The [[Rochester Knighthawks]] play [[box lacrosse]] in the [[National Lacrosse League]] during winter and spring. In outdoor lacrosse, the [[Rochester Rattlers]] were a charter member of [[Major League Lacrosse]], but the franchise was transferred to the new [[Hamilton Nationals|Toronto Nationals]] (MLL) in 2009; the Rattlers will be re-established in 2011 with the transfer of the [[Rochester Rattlers|Chicago Machine]] franchise. Also during the summer months, the Rochester Greywolves, comprising mostly local talent, play box lacrosse in the semi-pro CanAm Lacrosse League.

[[File:PAETEC Park overview.JPG|thumb|right|[[Sahlen's Stadium]]]]
The [[Rochester Razorsharks]], in the [[Premier Basketball League]], have dominated competition and already have multiple championships; the [[Rochester Lancers (indoor)|Rochester Lancers (2010)]] have started up in indoor soccer and are looking to have similar success. In the past, the [[Rochester Brigade]] and [[Rochester Raiders]] indoor football teams have played in Rochester; the former was unsuccessful but the latter garnered two championships before folding in 2010. A new indoor football team, the [[Roc City Thunder]], hopes to begin play in 2013.

In women's sports, Rochester is the home of the [[Western New York Flash]], 2011 [[Women's Professional Soccer]] champions. In prior years, the [[Rochester Ravens]] have competed in the semi-pro W-League under a few different names. The [[Filarets]] was a notable women's basketball team that played in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s.

The city also has an independent pro-wrestling league: NWA Upstate.

The absence of a major pro sports team has not always been the case. From 1920 to 1925, Rochester was home to the [[Rochester Jeffersons]], a charter member of the [[National Football League]]. From 1948 to 1957, the [[Sacramento Kings|Rochester Royals]] played in the [[National Basketball Association]], winning the NBA championship in 1951. In soccer, the [[Rochester Lancers]] played from 1970 to 1980 in the top-level [[North American Soccer League (1968–1984)|North American Soccer League]] and became NASL champions in the 1970 season.

Since 1877, 29 teams in eight professional sports have represented Rochester, according to ''The Rochester Sports Project'' by local sports historian [[Douglas Brei]]. In spring 2006, Brei showed that Rochester's professional sports teams were collectively approaching 25,000 games played. That game was played on June 16, 2006, when Red Wings hosted the [[Indianapolis Indians]] at Frontier Field. He also reports that only six active franchises in the history of North American professional sports have played in the same city and same league continuously and uninterrupted since the 19th century: [[Chicago Cubs]], [[Cincinnati Reds]], [[Philadelphia Phillies]], [[Pittsburgh Pirates]], [[St. Louis Cardinals]], and [[Rochester Red Wings]].

====Golf====
Rochester has a rich history in golf dating back to the 19th Century. The area's oldest club, The Country Club of Rochester (CCR) was founded in 1896. Oak Hill Country Club, which is often included in America's Top 100 Courses{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} is in the suburb of Pittsford. Oak Hill has hosted the Ryder Cup, Men's U.S Open, and PGA Championship to name a few. Locust Hill Country Club hosts the Wegman's LPGA Championship every year in late June. Numerous golf magazines have praised Rochester for its rich passion for the game and its high level of competition.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

====College sports====
Almost all area college sports are played at the [[Division III (NCAA)|NCAA Division III]] level. The only exceptions are the [[Rochester Institute of Technology|RIT]] [[RIT Tigers men's ice hockey|men's]] and [[RIT Tigers women's ice hockey|women's]] ice hockey teams, which compete at the Division I level. The men's team made it to the NCAA [[NCAA Men's Ice Hockey Championship|Frozen Four]] in 2010 and the women's team won the Division III national championship in 2012, just before switching over to Division I.

Among junior colleges, [[Monroe Community College|MCC]] is dominant{{Peacock term|date=August 2010}} in [[National Junior College Athletic Association|NJCAA]] Division II sports. They are also a D-III golf powerhouse and in addition won back to back national championships for women's lacrosse in 2010 and 2011.{{Peacock term|date=August 2010}}.

Rochester is the largest Metropolitan Statistical Area in the U.S. which does not include at least one college or university participating at the NCAA Division I level in all sports.

====Club Sports====
Rochester is home to two men's [[rugby football|rugby]] teams, the [[Rochester Aardvarks]] and the [[Rochester Colonials]]. Both have long histories, with the Aardvarks celebrating their 40th anniversary in 2006, and the Rochester Colonials celebrating 30 years upcoming in 2010. The Aardvarks are one of the few rugby teams in the country to own its own pitch: Aardvark Park in [[Henrietta, New York]], while the Colonials play their matches in the downtown located soccer stadium. The Aardvarks and the Colonials both have hosted local and state-wide tournaments and the Rochester Colonials hosted the 2007 USA Rugby National Collegiate All-Star Championships, Rochester's first national tournament, as well as the 2009 NYS Rugby Upstates Tournament and the 2009 New York State High School Rugby Championships. Both teams participate in the annual [[Can-Am Rugby Tournament]] in [[Saranac Lake, New York]] in early August. Rochester also has a Women's Rugby club, the [[Rochester Renegades]], who celebrated their 20th anniversary in 2008. The Renegades started the New York State Rugby Women's Division. {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}&lt;ref&gt;www.rochesterrugby.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transportation==
[[File:RochesterCanal RochesterNY.jpg|thumb|Barges on the [[Genesee River]]]]

===Maritime transport===
There is marine freight service at the [[Charlotte, Rochester, New York|Port of Rochester]] on [[Lake Ontario]], which is connected to the [[Atlantic Ocean]] via the [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]].

A short-lived, high-speed passenger/vehicle [[ferry]] [[HSC Dolphin Jet|Spirit of Ontario I]] built in Australia, nicknamed The Breeze or The Fast Ferry, linked Rochester to [[Toronto]] across Lake Ontario.  [[Canadian American Transportation Systems]](CATS) was the company in charge of the Fast Ferry operations. The Spirit of Ontario I had a delayed arrival on April 29, 2004 as a result of hitting a pier in New York City on April 5, 2004 and was finally officially christened on June 16, 2004 at the Port of Rochester. The Fast Ferry was bought by the City of Rochester in an attempt to save the project. The Fast Ferry operated between June 17, 2004, and December 12, 2005, and cost the city $42.5 million.  The project was initially well received by inhabitants of Rochester. Considerable effort was spent by inhabitants of Rochester to build up the waterfront to embrace the idea as well as to capitalize on potential tourism which was estimated to be an additional 75,000 tourists per month. In the first three months of operation the fast ferry had carried about 140,000 people between Rochester and Toronto. A second Fast Ferry was proposed by CATS on August 27, 2004 which would have cost an additional $100 Million. Due to a number of problems concerning the ship's engine(June 6, 2004 blown gasket and September 2004 to June 2005) requiring costly repairs, the lack of mutual building up of waterfronts in Toronto and the inability of the city to put pressure on the company responsible for the production of the Fast Ferry yielded in the failure of the project. It was sold to [[Förde Reederei Seetouristik]], a German company, for $30 million. The mayor at the time was [[William A. Johnson, Jr.]] and was succeeded by [[Robert Duffy (politician)|Robert Duffy]] on January 1, 2006.

===Air transport===
Rochester is served by the [[Greater Rochester International Airport]]. Daily scheduled air service is provided by [[Air Canada]], [[AirTran Airways|AirTran]], [[American Airlines|American]], [[Continental Airlines|Continental]], [[Delta Air Lines|Delta]], [[JetBlue Airways|JetBlue]], [[United Airlines|United]], and [[US Airways]]. Many of these airlines do not operate mainline service to Rochester; rather, they contract regional airlines to operate flights on their own, smaller aircraft.

In 2010, the GRIA was ranked the 14th-least expensive airport in the United States by [[Cheapflights]].&lt;ref name=&quot;D&amp;C_Airport_July2010&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title=CheapFlights rates Rochester airports No. 14|first=Emily|last=Shearing|url=http://www.democratandchronicle.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=20107170314|newspaper=[[Democrat and Chronicle]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|location=Rochester, New York|date=2010-07-17|accessdate=2010-07-21|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/5rO5cibGi|archivedate= 2010-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was considered a major achievement for the county and the airport authority; as recently as 2003, Rochester's ticket prices were among the highest in the country, ranking as high as fourth in 1999.&lt;ref name=&quot;13WHAM_Airfare&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.13wham.com/content/blogs/story/Rochesters-Airport-Are-Flights-Actually-Cheaper/Lv4X7lzU70qBkxcPvWYsWw.cspx|title=Rochester's Airport: Are Flights Actually Cheaper These Days?|first=Evan|last=Dawson|date=2010-07-12|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/5rTF9IL8H|archivedate=2010-07-24|accessdate=2010-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT_Airfare&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title=Travel Advisory: Correspondent's Report; Upstate New York May Get Air Fare Relief|first=David Cay|last=Johnston|url= http://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/21/travel/travel-advisory-correspondent-s-report-upstate-new-york-may-get-air-fare-relief.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]| location=[[New York City|New York, New York]]|date=1999-03-21|accessdate=2010-07-21|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/5rOmhTpAJ|archivedate=2010-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rails and mass transit===
{{See also|Rochester (Amtrak station)}}

Historically, Rochester was a major stop on train lines. It was served by the [[New York Central Railroad]] which served Chicago and Buffalo to the west and Albany and New York City to the east and southeast. The [[Buffalo, Rochester and Pittsburgh Railway]] (absorbed by the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]]) served Buffalo and Pittsburgh until 1955. A rail route to Salamanca in southern New York State afforded connections in [[Salamanca, New York|Salamanca]] to southwestern and southeastern New York State.&lt;ref&gt;Buffalo Rochester and Pittsburgh Railway http://www.r2parks.net/BR&amp;P.html&lt;/ref&gt; The last long-distance train in a southern direction was the ''Northern Express''/''Southern Express'' that went to [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]] via Canandaigua, Elmira and Williamsport; service ended in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher T. Baer, &quot;NAMED TRAINS OF THE PRR INCLUDING THROUGH SERVICES&quot; 2009 http://www.prrths.com/Hagley/PRR%20NAMED%20TRAINS.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Amtrak]] (passenger) and freight lines provide rail service to Rochester. Rochester has intercity and transcontinental bus service via [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]] and [[Trailways Transportation System|Trailways]].

Local bus service in Rochester and its county suburbs is provided by the [[Rochester-Genesee Regional Transportation Authority]] (RGRTA) via its Regional Transit Service (RTS) subsidiary. RTS also provides suburban service outside the immediate Rochester area and runs smaller transportation systems in outlying counties, such as WATS (Wayne Area Transportation System).

From 1927 to 1957, Rochester had a [[light rail]] underground transit system called the [[Rochester Subway]]. It was the smallest city in the world to have one. Over the years there have been privately sponsored proposals put forth that encourage the region to support a new system,  possibly using some of the old tunnels. One includes converting the Broad Street bridge tunnel&amp;mdash;the former canal aqueduct&amp;mdash;into an enhanced pedestrian corridor, which would also could include a Rochester Transportation Museum, and a tram system. [[File:Aqueduct under Broad St.jpg|thumb|The Broad Street Aqueduct was used as a subway tunnel]]

The former canal and subway tunnels have become a frequent source of debate. Several city homeless use the tunnels for shelter, and a few areas near tunnel entrances have gained the reputation as being dangerous. The city has considered multiple solutions for the space including recreating a canal way, putting the subway system back in or filling the tunnels entirely. The plan to fill the tunnels in completely has generated criticism as the cost of filling would not generate nor leverage economic development.

Public support continues to grow for re-watering the original Erie Canal through downtown Rochester.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} In support of the re-watering efforts, the City released a master plan in 2009 calling for the creation of Rochester's Historic Canal District. A subsequent environmental review document is set to be released in the near future, seeking additional public input. This district includes both private and public investment that builds upon the rich heritage of the district, educational opportunities, historic interpretation, architectural significant building and recreational amenities. The City is currently seeking public funds for implementing the first of three major phases of the Canal District.

[[File:Rochester - Main Street looking east.jpg|right|thumb|Main Street looking east]]

===Major highways and roads that serve the Greater Rochester Area===
There are three exits off the [[New York State Thruway]] ([[Interstate 90]]) that serve Rochester. Rochester has an extensive system of [[Limited-access road|limited-access highway]]s (called 'freeways' and 'expressways') which connects all parts of the city and the Thruway. During the Thruway's construction, a disagreement between the governor of New York and mayor of Rochester resulted in a bypass of downtown Rochester, leaving the city struggling for growth. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Rochester's expressway system, conceived in the 1950s, was designed as two concentric circles with feeder expressways from the west, south and east. The system allows for quick travel within the metropolitan area and a lack of the traffic gridlock typically found in cities of comparable size; in part this is because the system was designed to accommodate an anticipated year-2000 metro population of 5 million, whereas the present-day population is just over one million.

The [[New York State Route 47|Outer Loop]] circles just outside the city limits while the [[Inner Loop (Rochester)|Inner Loop]] circles around the immediate downtown area within the city. From the west are [[Lake Ontario State Parkway]], [[New York State Route 531|NY-531]] and [[Interstate 490 (New York)|I-490]]; [[Interstate 390]] feeds from the south; and [[New York State Route 104|NY-104]], [[New York State Route 441|NY-441]], and [[Interstate 490 (New York)|I-490]] approach from the east.

===Later Expressway Proposals===
In the early 1970s, the Genesee Expressway Task Force, City leaders, and NYSDOT studied the feasibility of connecting the outer and inner Loops with a new southern expressway. The proposed route extended north from the I-390 and I-590 interchange in Brighton, cutting through Rochester's Swillburg neighborhood. In 1972, consultants Berger Lehman Associates recommended a new 'Busway', an expressway with dedicated bus lanes, similar to Bus Rapid Transit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pritchard| first=Keith|title=Fate of 'Busway' Rests With Drivers|newspaper=Rochester Democrat and Chronicle|date=1972-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The expressway extension was never built.

'''Three [[Interstate Highway System|Interstate Highways]] run through the City of Rochester:'''

[[File:I-390.svg|25px]] [[Interstate 390]] (Genesee Expressway)
*I-390 runs south-north, crossing [[Interstate 90|I-90]] (exit 46) and routing north through Rochester's western suburbs. Its northern end is at [[Interstate 490 (New York)|I-490]], however it continues north as [[New York State Route 390|NY-390]] until it merges into the [[Lake Ontario State Parkway]]. South of I-90, I-390 runs to [[Avoca, New York]], where it meets up with [[U.S. Route 15]] and the Southern Tier Expressway, [[Interstate 86 (east)|I-86]].
[[File:I-490.svg|25px]] [[Interstate 490 (New York)|Interstate 490]] (Western/Eastern Expressway)
*I-490 runs west-east through Rochester, starting at [[Le Roy, New York]] and ending in [[Victor, New York]]. It interchanges with the two other Interstates in Rochester: [[Interstate 390|I-390]] at the western city limit and [[Interstate 590|I-590]] at the eastern limit, as well as connecting at both ends with the Thruway, [[Interstate 90|I-90]] (exits 47 and 45). In July 2007, a new bridge over the [[Genesee River]] was completed and named the [[Frederick Douglass–Susan B. Anthony Memorial Bridge]].
[[File:I-590.svg|25px]] [[Interstate 590]]
*I-590 runs south-north through Rochester's eastern suburbs. Its southern end is at [[Interstate 390|I-390]], while the northern end is at [[Interstate 490 (New York)|I-490]]; the highway continues north to the shore of Lake Ontario as [[New York State Route 590|NY-590]].

*In decreasing usage is the term &quot;[[Can of Worms (interchange)|Can of Worms]]&quot;, referring to the previously dangerous at-grade intersection of [[Interstate 490 (New York)|Interstate 490]] and expressway [[New York State Route 590|NY-590]] on the eastern edge of the Rochester city limits, bordering the suburb of [[Brighton, Monroe County, New York|Brighton]]. In the 1980s, a multimillion dollar project created a system of overpasses and ramps that reduced the danger but resulted in the loss of certain exits.

'''[[List of state routes in New York|New York State Route]] Expressways:'''

[[File:NY-104.svg|25px]] [[New York State Route 104]] (Irondequoit-Wayne County Expressway, West Ridge Road)
*NY 104 - Just east of the NY 590 interchange, NY 104 becomes the Irondequoit-Wayne County Expressway and crosses the [[Irondequoit Bay Bridge]]. On the other side of the Bay Bridge, in the town of Webster, NY 104 has exits before returning to an at-grade highway at Basket Road.
[[File:NY-390.svg|25px]] [[New York State Route 390]]
*NY 390 is an extension of Interstate 390 from the I-390/I-490 interchange in Gates. The northern terminus is at the Lake Ontario State Parkway in Greece, less than a mile from the Lake Ontario shoreline.
[[File:NY-590.svg|25px]] [[New York State Route 590]]
*NY 590 is a limited-access extension of Interstate 590 at runs from an interchange between Interstate 490 and I-590 on the Brighton/Rochester border. The northern terminus is at Culver Road in Irondequoit, near Sea Breeze (the western shore of Irondequoit Bay at Lake Ontario).
[[File:Rochester Inner Loop.svg|25px]] [[Inner Loop (Rochester)|Inner Loop]]
*The Inner Loop encircles the downtown Rochester area. Unsigned reference New York State Route 940T begins and ends at Interstate 490, and the rest of the Loop is part of I-490 between exits 13 and 15, including the Frederick Douglass&amp;nbsp;– Susan B. Anthony Memorial Bridge.

'''[[Parkways in New York|New York State Parkways]]:'''

[[File:Lake Ontario State Parkway.svg|25px]] [[Lake Ontario State Parkway]]
*Lake Ontario State Parkway travels from [[Lakeside Beach State Park]] in Carlton, Orleans County. The eastern end is at Lake Avenue in the city of Rochester in Monroe County.

'''Long Beach''' is a [[Administrative divisions of New York#City|city]] in [[Nassau County, New York|Nassau County]], [[New York]], [[United States]]. Just south of [[Long Island]], it is located on [[Long Beach Barrier Island]], which is the westernmost of the [[Outer barrier|outer barrier islands]] off [[South Shore (Long Island)|Long Island's South Shore]]. As of the [[United States 2010 Census]], the city population was 33,275. It was incorporated in 1922,&lt;ref name=&quot;longbeachny.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.longbeachny.org/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&amp;SEC={28E55847-1D6D-4DBD-B1E1-40C6A6D151EB}&amp;DE={42F2F6EA-F074-43E6-8FB6-BD845285CF9C} Our History provided by Newsday (City of Long Beach Official Site)]&lt;/ref&gt; and is [[nickname]]d ''The City By the Sea'' (as seen in [[Latin (language)|Latin]] on its official seal).

The City of Long Beach is surrounded by Reynolds Channel to the north, east and west, and the Atlantic Ocean to the south.

As of 2012, Jack Schnirman is the [[city manager]], a position appointed by the [[City Council]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.longbeachny.gov/index.asp?Type=B_DIR&amp;SEC={C50281EA-B062-44FD-B714-35C29EDE6CB7}&amp;DE={322DB027-B794-4136-AC30-91FE0BE18855}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
The community became an [[Political subdivisions of New York State#Village|incorporated village]] in 1913 and a city in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.longbeachny.org http://www.longbeachny.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early history===
Long Beach's first inhabitants were the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]-speaking [[Rockaway Indians]], who sold the area to English [[colonists]] in 1643. While the barrier island was used by [[fisherman|baymen]] and farmers for fishing and harvesting [[salt hay]], no one lived there year-round for more than two centuries.  In 1849 Congress established a lifesaving station. A dozen years before, 62 people died when the [[barque]] ''Mexico'', carrying Irish immigrants to New York, ran ashore on New Year's Day.

Austin Corbin, a builder from [[Brooklyn]], was the first to attempt to develop the island as a [[resort]]. He formed a partnership with the [[Long Island Rail Road]] (LIRR) to finance the [[New York and Long Beach Railroad Co]]., which laid track from [[Lynbrook, New York|Lynbrook]] to Long Beach in 1880. That same year, Corbin opened Long Beach Hotel, a row of 27 cottages along a {{convert|1100|ft|m|sing=on}} strip of beach, which he claimed as the world's largest hotel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.homestead.com/captfxco/LongBeachHotel.html The Long Beach Hotel: 1880-1907 (I Love Long Beach New York.com)]&lt;/ref&gt; In its first season, the railroad brought 300,000 visitors to Long Island.  By the next spring, tracks had been laid the length of the island, but they were removed in 1894 after repeated washouts from winter storms.

On July 29, 1907, a fire broke out at the Long Beach Hotel and burned it to the ground. Of the 800 guests, eight were injured by jumping from windows, and one woman died. The fire was blamed on defective electric wiring. A church, several cottages and the bathing pavilion were also destroyed. Trunks belonging to the guests, which had been piled on the sand to form &quot;dressing rooms&quot;, were looted by thieves. A dozen waiters and others were apprehended by the police, who recovered $20,000 worth of jewelry and other stolen property.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;1907: Fire Destroys Hotel,&quot; In Our Pages, ''International Herald Tribune,'' accessed 29 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Riviera of the East===
{{refimprove section|date=January 2013}}
[[Image:longbeach 1911.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Long Beach boardwalk, c. 1911]] In 1906, William Reynolds, a 39-year-old former state senator and real estate developer, entered the picture. Reynolds had already developed four Brooklyn neighborhoods ([[Bedford-Stuyvesant]], [[Borough Park]], [[Bensonhurst]] and [[South Brownsville]]) and [[Coney Island]]'s [[Dreamland (amusement park)|Dreamland]], the world's largest amusement park. Reynolds also owned a theater and produced plays.  He gathered investors and acquired the oceanfront from private owners and the rest of the island from the [[Town of Hempstead, New York|Town of Hempstead]] in 1907; he planned to build a [[boardwalk]], homes and hotels.

Reynolds had a herd of [[elephant]]s marched in from Dreamland, ostensibly to help build the boardwalk; he had created an effective [[publicity stunt]]. Dredges created a channel {{convert|1000|ft|m}} wide on the north side of the island to provide access by large steamboats and sea planes to transport more visitors. The new waterway was named [[Reynolds Channel]].

[[Image:longbeach 1923.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Crowded beach, c. 1923]]

To ensure that Long Beach lived up to his billing it &quot;The [[French Riviera|Riviera]] of the East&quot;, he required each building to be constructed in an &quot;eclectic [[Mediterranean]] style,&quot; with white [[stucco]] walls and red-clay tile roofs. He built a theater called Castles by the Sea, with the largest dance floor in the world, for dancers [[Vernon and Irene Castle]]. He restricted owners and renters to white Anglo-Saxon Protestants (WASPs). After Reynolds' corporation went bankrupt in 1918, the restrictions were lifted. The new town attracted wealthy businessmen and entertainers from New York and Hollywood.

In the 1940s, [[Jose Ferrer]], [[Zero Mostel]], [[Mae West]], and other famous actors performed at local theaters.  [[Jack Dempsey]], [[Cab Calloway]], [[Humphrey Bogart]], Lillian Roth, [[Rudolph Valentino]], [[Florenz Ziegfeld]], [[James Cagney]], [[Clara Bow]], and [[John Barrymore]] lived in Long Beach for decades. Other natives include  [[Billy Crystal]]{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} (his brother Joel Crystal has served as president of the Long Beach City Council),{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} [[Joan Jett]],{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} [[Derek Jeter]],{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} [[John Lannan]],{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} and &quot;Long Island Lolita&quot; [[Amy Fisher]].{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

===Corruption and scandal===
{{refimprove section|date=January 2013}}
In 1923, the world-famous [[prohibition]] agents known simply as [[Izzy Einstein and Moe Smith|Izzy and Moe]] raided the Nassau Hotel and arrested three men for bootlegging. In 1930, five [[Long Beach Police Department (New York)|Long Beach Police]] officers were charged with offering a bribe to a [[United States Coast Guard]] officer to allow liquor to be landed. {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} The police had another problem a year later: a mystery that captivated the nation in the summer of 1931. A [[beachcombing|beachcomber]] found the body of a young woman named Starr Faithfull. She had left behind a suicide note, but others believed she had been murdered. {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

By the early twenties, corruption became rampant in Long Beach. {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} In 1922, the state Legislature designated Long Beach a city and William H. Reynolds was elected the first mayor. Shortly thereafter Reynolds was indicted on charges of misappropriating funds. When he was found guilty, the clock in the tower at city hall was stopped in protest. When a judge released Reynolds from jail later that year on appeal, almost the entire population turned out to greet him, and the clock was turned back on. {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

In 1939, Mayor Louis F. Edwards was fatally shot by a police officer on the front steps of his home. Officer Alvin Dooley, a member of the police motorcycle squad and the mayor's own security detail, killed the mayor after losing his bid for [[Police Benevolent Association|PBA]] president to a candidate the mayor supported. Jackson Boulevard was later renamed Edwards Boulevard in honor of the late mayor.  After the murder, the city residents passed legislation to adopt a city manager system, which still exists to this day. The city manager is hired by and reports to the City Council.

===Urban decay and renewal===
{{refimprove | section, except for one footnote, | date=January 2013}}
By the 1940s and 1950s, with the advent of cheap air travel attracting tourists to more distant places, and air-conditioning to provide year-round comfort, Long Beach had become a primarily [[bedroom community]] for commuters to New York City.  It still attracted many summer visitors into the 1970s. The rundown boardwalk hotels were used for temporary housing for welfare recipients and the elderly until a scandal around 1970 led to many of the homes' losing licenses. At that time, government agencies were also &quot;warehousing&quot; in such hotels many patients released from larger mental hospitals. They were supposed to be cared for in small-scale community centers.

The {{convert|2.2|mi|km|sing=on}} boardwalk had a small [[amusement park]] at the foot of Edwards Boulevard until the late 1970s. In the late 1960s, the boardwalk and amusement park area were a magnet for youth from around [[Long Island, New York|Long Island]], until a police crackdown on drug trafficking ended that. While there are few businesses left on the boardwalk, it attracts bicyclists, joggers, walkers and people-watchers.

Beginning in the 1980s and accelerating in the 1990s, Long Beach has begun an urban renewal, with new housing, new businesses and other improvements. Today, the city is again a popular bedroom community, for people working in New York who want the quiet beach atmosphere. With summer come local youths and college students and young adults who rent [[bungalows]] on the West End; they  frequent the local bars and clubs along West Beech Street.

Just behind the boardwalk near the center of the City, &quot;vacant&quot; lots now occupy several blocks that once housed hotels, bathhouses and the amusement park. Because attempts to attract development (including, at one time, [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]]-style [[casino]]s) to this potential [[City block|Superblock]] have not yet borne fruit, the lots comprise the city's largest portion of unused land.

===Post-Hurricane Sandy===
[[File:Post_Sandy_Boardwalk_In_Long_Beach_NY.jpg|400px|thumb|left|The newly rebuilt boardwalk in November 2013.]]
In 2012, the famous boardwalk was destroyed by [[Hurricane Sandy]]. With the help of [[FEMA]] and the [[Army Corps of Engineers]], the boardwalk will be rebuilt to withstand hurricanes and flooding. City Manager [[Jack Schnirman]] said they will rebuild Long Beach &quot;better than ever.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=City Questioned on Boardwalk Rebuild Schedule|url=http://longbeach.patch.com/groups/lb-politics/p/city-questioned-on-boardwalk-rebuild-schedule|publisher=thepatch.com|accessdate=26 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first two-block section of the new Long Beach boardwalk reopened on July 26, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1st section of Long Beach boardwalk reopens after Superstorm Sandy|url=http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/long_island&amp;id=9185607|publisher=WABC TV|accessdate=26 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entire boardwalk opened on October 25, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Long Beach boardwalk to fully reopen after Superstorm Sandy|url=http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/long_island&amp;id=9300780|publisher=WABC TV|accessdate=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transportation==

===Buses===
*[[Long Beach Bus]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.longbeachny.gov/vertical/sites/%7BC3C1054A-3D3A-41B3-8896-814D00B86D2A%7D/uploads/%7BC093BB43-F8A2-4F48-9996-4466C2D51FFA%7D.PDF&lt;/ref&gt; operates a twenty-four hour municipal bus service with five routes, including three routes serving the city, one overnight circulator route, and one route, the N69, extending service to [[Lido Beach, New York|Lido Beach]] and [[Point Lookout, New York|Point Lookout]] under contract to Nassau County. Long Beach Bus also operates a trolley bus.

*[[Nassau Inter-County Express]] (NICE) has two bus routes that originate in Long Beach; the N15 and N33 travel to [[Roosevelt Field]] and [[Far Rockaway]] via [[Rockville Centre]] and [[Atlantic Beach, New York|Atlantic Beach]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nicebus.com/_meta/NewRoutePDFs/NICE-April_8_n15_MapSchedule.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nicebus.com/_meta/NewRoutePDFs/NICE-April_8_n33_MapSchedule.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The N33 does not provide service wholly within Long Beach.

==Layout==
Unlike most suburbs, Long Beach is a high-density community. Fewer than 40% of the homes are detached houses,&lt;ref&gt;http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/QTTable?_bm=y&amp;-geo_id=86000US11561&amp;-qr_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U_DP4&amp;-ds_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U&amp;-_lang=en&amp;-_sse=on&lt;/ref&gt; and the city ranks as the 24th densest community in the United States.

The city is less than a mile wide from ocean to bay and about three and a half miles long. The city is divided into the West End, home to many small [[bungalow]]s, and the East End. West of New York Avenue, the barrier island is less than a half mile wide and West Beech Street is the main east/west commercial street.

East of New York Avenue, the island is wider between the bay and ocean and is home to larger more expansive family houses.  There is the city's boardwalk, which begins at New York Avenue and ends at Neptune Boulevard. Along the boardwalk are many apartment buildings and condos. The main commercial strip is Park Avenue, which narrows into a small residential strip west of New York Avenue.

'''Jamestown''' is a city in southern [[Chautauqua County, New York|Chautauqua County]], [[New York]], in the [[United States]]. The population was 31,146 at the [[United States Census 2010|2010 census]]. Situated between [[Lake Erie]] to the northwest and the [[Allegheny National Forest]] to the south, Jamestown is the largest population center in the county. Nearby [[Chautauqua Lake]] is a fresh water resource enjoyed by fishermen, boaters and naturalists. [[Chautauqua Institution]] is approximately 17 miles away, offering music, theater, educational classes and lectures for nine weeks during the summer.

Notable people from the Jamestown area include [[comedienne]] [[Lucille Ball]]; [[Supreme Court Justice]] [[Robert H. Jackson]]; naturalist [[Roger Tory Peterson]]; and NFL Commissioner [[Roger Goodell]]. Products developed in Jamestown include the [[crescent wrench]] and [[Voting machine|automatic voting machines]].

Jamestown was once called the &quot;Furniture Capital of the World&quot; where people visited from all over the country to attend furniture expositions at the Furniture Mart, a building that still stands in the city and currently houses offices for a variety of companies.

==Jamestown today==
Beginning with the construction of the $26 million dual-pad, state-of-the-art Jamestown Savings Bank Ice Arena [http://www.jamestownarena.com jamestownarena.com] in 1990, private-public partnerships resulted in a number of revitalization projects in the downtown. In 2006 the firm Goody Clancy prepared the Jamestown Urban Design Plan for the City that would act as a guide for revitalization efforts. As a result the Jamestown Renaissance Corporation (JRC) [http://www.jrconline.org jrconline.org] was formed in order to implement the plan.

Development activity spurred private investment in the form of a $3 million Best Western and $7.25 million retail/professional office building called the BWB Center. JRC worked with municipal and philanthropic partners to realize the construction of Renaissance Square, a public gathering space near the BWB Center.

Close to 30 facades restorations of downtown buildings will be accomplished by the end of 2012 through public/private partnerships with JRC.  The Alley Enhancement Program, another public/private partnership resulted in the enhancement of five alleyways in the downtown core, making them more attractive and safe for pedestrian traffic. In one of the alleys, JRC worked with Jamestown Community College and Jamestown High School to create a public art installation called Potters gALLErY.
In 2010, JRC spearheaded the demolition of a deteriorated movie theater, the Wintergarden Theater, and converted the space into an attractive public downtown park.

A key component of the Urban Design Plan is revitalization of the riverfront that runs through the City of Jamestown. Increasing public access to the [[Chadakoin River]] by creating small parks and a pedestrian trail is currently underway.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jrconline.org/dt-Water_R&amp;D.html&lt;/ref&gt;

North Star Destination Strategies created a branding study and implementation guide for the city in 2010 as part of the revitalization process. As a result, the tag line &quot;Jamestown Up Close and Wonderful&quot; with an accompanying logo appears on posters and signs throughout the City, on the new accompanying website, [http://www.jamestownupclose.com jamestownupclose.com] and on public relations materials.

Two additional restoration projects are expected to be completed by the end of 2012.  The $12 million restored Erie-Lackawanna Railroad Station will become the Gateway Station, offering public space in its concourse. The concourse will be used as a multi-modal transportation station and be available for private functions.  Two wings on either side of the concourse contain 18,000 square feet of commercial area. The Wellman project transformed two run-down adjoined buildings into 40 attractive market-rate apartments, storefronts and office space.
As of November 2013, these urban renewal projects have caused a massive increase of highly intelligent white collar workers.  As of today, 11/13, 6,234 new residents have moved into these dwellings.

==History==
Jamestown is named after James Prendergast, an early Chautauqua County settler. His family purchased {{convert|3500|acre|km2}} in 1806, in the area now known as Chautauqua County. James Prendergast explored the area that is now Jamestown. Prendergast saw the area to be valuable, and so he purchased {{convert|1000|acre|km2}} of land in the area in 1808. In the fall of 1809, Prendergast and an employee, John Blowers built a log cabin, which became the first building in Jamestown.

== History ==
{{Refimprove|date=May 2009}}
The first settlement in the town of Corning was made near the site of the future city in 1796. The community was set apart from the town as a [[Administrative divisions of New York#Village|village]] in 1848. Corning was incorporated as a city in 1890. As the [[glass]] industry developed, Corning became known as the &quot;Crystal City.&quot;

The Corning area's first real industry was [[lumber]]. The first settlers used the area's river systems to transport logs and finished lumber in fleets downstream to buyers. This gave rise to large mills which helped to develop the area. Rafting of lumber began to wane as timber was depleted. At one time the mills of the Corning area were reputed to be among the biggest in the world. After the lumber was depleted the great mills moved north to new forests.

East, across the [[Chemung River]] from Corning, lies [[Gibson, New York|Gibson]], the site of a feeder canal for the [[Chemung Canal]] system. Some of Corning's early prosperity came from the feeder canal system exposure. Canal cargoes from Corning included [[soft coal]], [[timber]], [[tobacco]], [[grain]], and [[whiskey]]. From April 22 to December 11, 1850, the canal season that year, the newspaper reported that 1,116 boats left the port of Corning. Tolls for the year totaled $54,060.39. Among items shipped were 46,572,400 pounds of coal. The canal's best peacetime year was 1854 when 270,978 tons of freight was hauled. The [[American Civil War|Civil War]] brought an abnormal amount of business, with a peak of 307,151 tons hauled in one year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corningny.com/history4.shtml Corning, New York - The Crystal City - CorningNY.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Civil War, an industrial boom occurred in the region. [[Ingersoll Rand]] opened during this period in [[Painted Post, New York|Painted Post]], just north of Corning.

Corning became a [[railroad town]] in the 1880s, many smaller railroad lines busily weaving webs of tracks connecting the major trunk line to smaller communities. In 1912, the [[Corning train wreck]] three miles east of Corning in Gibson left 39 dead.

The [[Jenning's Tavern]], [[Corning Armory]], [[Market Street Historic District (Corning, New York)|Market Street Historic District]], [[Southside Historic District (Corning, New York)|Southside Historic District]], [[World War Memorial Library]], and [[United States Post Office (Corning, New York)|United States Post Office]] are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nris&quot;&gt;{{NRISref|2009a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just upstream from Corning, the [[Cohocton River]] and the [[Tioga River (Chemung River)|Tioga River]] merge to form the [[Chemung River]] which flows through downtown.  The river was an important source of [[water power|power]] in the early history, and is part of the attractiveness of the region today. The river is prone to floods, as rain water runs off quickly from the steep hillsides of the area, the worst recent flood being in 1972, as the remnants of [[Hurricane Agnes]] dropped fifteen or more inches of rain in the area within a short time. Eighteen people were killed in the immediate Corning-Painted Post area.  The entire downtown area was flooded, with severe damage. Downtown has been refurbished and has become somewhat [[gentrified]].

Flooding is now controlled by a system of dams upstream from Corning.

[[Interstate 86 (east)|Interstate 86]] (the [[Southern Tier Expressway]]), [[New York State Route 17]], [[New York State Route 352]], [[New York State Route 414]], and [[New York State Route 415]] are major highways connecting in Corning.  County Road 40 leads into the city from the south and County Road 41 from the north.  [[U.S. Route 15]] proceeds southward from Painted Post, west of Corning.

The City of Corning is in the Finger lakes Region.

* Bloody Run &amp;ndash; An area near Gorton Creek, it was the site of a battle between forces of American generals [[John Sullivan (general)|John Sullivan]] and [[James Clinton]] and Native American villagers. This battle was part of a campaign directly ordered by [[George Washington]] to break the control of the [[Iroquois]] Indians in the area. It was called Bloody Run for the reports of bloody creek water coming from the battle scene.

* Horace D. Page Tunnel &amp;ndash; A tunnel connecting the two divided areas of Denison Park, located on the city's South side. It was named after Page, who lost the naming rights to [[Elmira, New York|Elmira's]] Millers (formerly Page's) Pond in a 1912 horse racing bet at [[Tioga Downs]], and was given naming rights to the tunnel as compensation.

== The flood of 1972 ==

The flood of 1972 was a major event for the area. On June 22, 1972, the storm that had been [[Hurricane Agnes]] struck the [[Southern Tier]] of New York. The storm combined with a storm system from [[Ohio]] to drop six to eight inches (203&amp;nbsp;mm)  of rain in the [[Chemung River]] basin. This ultimately overwhelmed the flood control systems of the time, and the Chemung River broke through the dam system on Friday, June 23 at 4:00 a.m. By 9:00 a.m. the river crested and began to recede. In the Corning area, eighteen people were killed and untold millions of dollars of damage was incurred. An example of these expenses took place in the town of Bath, NY, where a local woman, Lila Marano cooked nearly 100 pizzas out of her home kitchen to accommodate students at the Haverling High School graduation reception. The river receded within hours, leaving mud which can still be found in basements of homes and businesses in Corning, and there is a section of the [[Corning Museum of Glass]] that indicates on the wall how high the flood waters rose.

'''Elmira''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɛ|l|ˈ|m|aɪ|r|ə}} is a [[Administrative divisions of New York#City|city]] in [[Chemung County, New York|Chemung County]], [[New York]], [[United States|USA]]. It is the principal city of the 'Elmira, New York [[Metropolitan Statistical Area]]' which encompasses  Chemung County, New York. The population was 29,200 at the [[United States Census 2010|2010 census]].  It is the [[county seat]] of [[Chemung County]].

The '''City of Elmira''' is located in the south-central part of the county, surrounded on three sides by the [[Administrative divisions of New York#Town|Town]] of [[Elmira (town), New York|Elmira]].  It is in the [[Southern Tier]] of New York a short distance north of the [[Pennsylvania]] state line.

== History ==

=== Early history ===
This was long an area inhabited by indigenous people. In historic times, it was occupied by the [[Cayuga Nation of New York|Cayuga]] nation of the [[Iroquois Confederacy]], also called the ''[[Kanawaholla]]''. They had some relations with Europeans and English over fur trading, but were relatively isolated from the encroaching settlements.

During the [[American Revolutionary War]], the [[Sullivan Expedition]] of 1779 was mounted against the four [[Iroquois]] nations who had allied with the British and Loyalist forces.  It fought a combined British-Iroquois force at the [[Battle of Newtown]], south of the current city, in which Sullivan and his forces were victorious. After the conclusion of the war, the [[Iroquois]] and the new United States made a treaty at Elmira in 1791 to settle territorial disputes in the region. Most of the Seneca emigrated under pressure with the other Iroquois to Canada, where they resettled on land provided by the British Crown.

The first European-American settler in Elmira was captain Curtis Rumsey of the [[Continental Army]]. He built a cabin after resigning just before the Revolutionary War. Miller's Pond and Miller Street are named after him and are near the location of his house.

=== Elmira's formation  ===
The New York legislature established the Township of [[Chemung, New York|Chemung]], now Chemung County, in 1788. The settlement of Newtown was soon established at the intersection of Newtown Creek and the [[Chemung River]]. In 1792, the settlement at Newtown joined with the Wisnerburg and DeWittsburg settlements to form the village of Newtown. In 1808, the village officially changed its name to the [[Elmira (town), New York|Town of Elmira]], at a town meeting held at Teal's Tavern. It is said the town was named after tavern owner Nathan Teal's young daughter, but that story has never been confirmed. In any case, the City of Elmira, also called &quot;The Queen City&quot;, was incorporated in 1864 from part of the town of Elmira and the village of Elmira.  The remaining part of the town of Elmira exists still, surrounding the city on the west, north and east. The city and town share an intricately entwined history.  According to Amos B. Carpenter's Family History book printed in 1898, Elmira is named after [[Major General]] Matthew Carpenter's daughter. This occurred according to the book in 1821 at the constitutional convention which Matthew was a delegate to.

Elmira served as a transportation hub for New York's Southern Tier in the 1800s, connecting commercial centers in [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]] and [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] with [[Albany, New York|Albany]] and [[New York City]], via the canal system and railroads. The city was the southern terminus of the [[Chemung Canal]] (completed in 1833); later, the [[Junction Canal]] was constructed to connect Elmira with [[Corning (city), New York|Corning]], facilitating transport of coal from the [[Pennsylvania]] mines via the Northern branch of the Susquehanna Canal system. In 1849, the [[New York and Erie Railroad]] was built through Elmira, giving the area a New York City to Buffalo route. In 1850, the Elmira and Jefferson Railroad gave the area a route north and the Elmira and Williamsport Railroad a route south in 1854. 
This made the city a prime location for an [[US Army|Army]] training and muster point early in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. 
In 1872 the Utica Ithaca and Elmira Railroad was begun, eventually creating a route to Cortland and Syracuse via Horseheads, [[Breesport, New York|Breesport]] and VanEtten. The [[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad]] was completed in 1884, which competed with the Erie's New York City to Buffalo line.

===Prisoner-of-war camp===
A great deal of the {{convert|30|acre|m2|sing=on}} Union installation, known as Camp Rathbun, fell into disuse as the Civil War progressed, and the camp's [[Elmira Prison|&quot;Barracks #3&quot;]] were converted into a Civil War [[prisoner of war camp]] in the summer of 1864. The camp, in use from June 6, 1864 until autumn 1865,  was dubbed &quot;Hellmira&quot; by its inmates. Towner's history of 1892 and maps from the period indicate the camp occupied a somewhat irregular [[parallelogram]], running about {{convert|1000|ft|m|-2}} west and approximately the same distance south of a location a couple of hundred feet west of Hoffman Street (Foster Avenue?) and Winsor Avenue, bordered on the south by Foster's Pond more or less, on the north bank of the Chemung River.

In the months the site was used as a camp, 12,123 [[Confederate soldier]]s were incarcerated; of these, 2,963 died during their stay from a combination of [[malnutrition]], prolonged exposure to brutal winter weather and disease directly attributable to the dismal sanitary conditions on Foster's Pond and lack of medical care. The camp's dead were prepared for burial and laid to rest by the [[sexton (office)|sexton]] at [[Woodlawn National Cemetery]], ex-slave [[John W. Jones (ex-slave)|John W. Jones]]. At the end of the war, each prisoner was given a loyalty oath and given a train ticket back home; the last prisoner left the camp on September 27, 1865. The camp was closed, demolished and converted to farmland. Woodlawn Cemetery, about {{convert|2|mi|km|0}} north of the original prison camp site (bounded by West Hill, Bancroft, Davis and Mary Streets), was designated a &quot;[[National Cemetery]]&quot; in 1877. The prison camp site is today a residential area.

As Elmira grew, so did the citizens' concern about increased crime after the end of the war; the idea of constructing a [[reformatory]] within the city had been discussed for some years. Finally, lands on which the present-day [[Elmira Correctional Facility]] resides, approximately {{convert|280|acre|km2|1}} in all (north of Bancroft across the street from Woodlawn Cemetery), were purchased in 1869 and 1870 by the state legislature, specifically for construction of the reformatory and an [[armory (military)|armory]]. These lay within the boundaries of the town of Elmira, rather than the city. Around the same time, Dr. Eldwin Eldridge purchased a large tract of wilderness (~ {{convert|100|acre|km2|1}}) with a small pond, also within the township and developed it into a fabulous garden spot. His sudden death in 1876 put paid to his plans to develop the land further. After his death, Dr. Eldridge's estate granted access to the parkland to Elmira residents and tourists. In 1889, the city purchased the land, calling it Eldridge Park in the doctor's honor. The park this time held a nearly {{convert|15|acre|m2|sing=on}} lake in its center, along with marble statuary, flower gardens, fountains, driving and walking paths and a labyrinth. In 1890, along with Eldridge Park, the reformatory and armory, the city added a well-populated area  known as &quot;Carr's Corners&quot; (area bounded by Hoffman, West Hill and Hillcrest (old Carr Road) - and appears to include the residential area around and to the south of Woodlawn National Cemetery{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}.

=== Elmira economy===
In 1950, the population of the City of Elmira peaked at about 50,000, which represented 57 percent of Chemung County’s total population at that time. Today, the City has approximately 30,000 residents, which represents 34 percent of Chemung County’s total population. This population decline is due to the national decline in railroads and manufacturing as well as a population shift to the outer suburbs around Elmira. The Elmira Metro area has nearly 100,000 in population.

Today, the primary manufacturing employers are:

'''Middletown''' is a [[Administrative divisions of New York#City|city]] in [[Orange County, New York|Orange County]], [[New York]], [[United States]]. It lies in New York's [[Hudson Valley]] region, near the [[Wallkill River]] and the foothills of the [[Shawangunk Mountains]]. Middletown is situated between [[Port Jervis, New York|Port Jervis]] and [[Newburgh (city), New York|Newburgh, New York]]. The city's population was 25,388 at the [[United States Census 2000|2000 census]] and 28,086 as of the [[United States Census 2010|2010 census]]. The [[zip code]] is 10940.

Middletown is a principal city of the [[Poughkeepsie (city), New York|Poughkeepsie]]–[[Newburgh (city), New York|Newburgh]]–Middletown, NY [[Poughkeepsie-Newburgh-Middletown metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]] (MSA), which includes all of [[Dutchess County, New York|Dutchess]] and Orange counties. The two-county MSA had a population of 621,517 at the [[United States Census, 2000|2000 census]].{{GR|2}} A July 1, 2007 estimate placed the population at 669,915.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.census.gov/popest/metro/tables/2007/CBSA-EST2007-01.csv | title = Annual Estimates of the Population of Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Areas: April 1, 2000 to July 1, 2007 (CBSA-EST2007-01) | format = [[comma-separated values|CSV]] | work = 2007 Population Estimates | publisher = [[United States Census Bureau]], Population Division | date = 2008-03-27 | accessdate = 2009-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city also lies along the northern boundary of the [[New York metropolitan area]].

==History and economy==

===Early history===
[[Image:East Main Street, Middletown, NY.jpg|thumb|left|East Main Street in 1909]]
John Green purchased land from the DeLancey patent and probably settled the area around 1744. Due to its location between other pre-existing locations, the name of Middletown was adopted, but later changed to South Middletown to avoid confusion with another nearby location.  Eventually the word &quot;south&quot; was dropped, giving the current name when the community became a village in 1848. The village was incorporated as a city in 1888.

The [[First Congregational Church of Middletown]], established in 1785, has the highest spire downtown. It can be argued that the construction of the church marks the beginning of Middletown's existence as a village.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thrall.org/photos/106.htm Photo and description of the First Congregational Church]&lt;/ref&gt; The current building was constructed in 1872.

===Growth of Middletown===
[[File:Middletown NY Station LOC 121197pu.jpg|thumb|left|[[Middletown (Erie Railroad station)|The Erie Railroad's Middletown Station]] in 1971, now Thrall Library]]
Middletown grew up with the [[Erie Railroad]] and the [[New York, Ontario and Western Railway]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web   | last = Yashinac   | first = Rob   | title = Ontario &amp; Western Railway Station   | publisher = Hudson Valley Ruins   | date = September 2006   | url = http://www.hudsonvalleyruins.org/yasinsac/orange/OandW.html   | accessdate = 2013-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; (among others) and attracted a number of employers, such as shoe, lawnmower blade, and furniture factories, but most of these businesses had closed by the 1960s. The closing of a large [[Ford Motor Company]] plant in [[Mahwah, New Jersey]], and the downsizing of [[IBM]] operations in the area were a blow to the economy of Middletown and surrounding communities in the 1970s.

Beginning in the 1970s, [[New York City]] police officers, firefighters and other workers moved to the area to purchase houses that were much less expensive than those nearer the city. These long-distance commuters helped to bolster the economy of the area.  After 1986, however, when New York City required its municipal employees to be resident in the city,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcas/html/resources/100_8.shtml New York City residency requirements], NYC.gov, accessed April 28, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Middletown lost this source of growth.  The only railroad left in town is the [[Middletown and New Jersey Railway]], a freight line.

===Modern Middletown===
[[File:WebbHortonPC.JPG|thumb|left|[[Webb Horton House|Morrison Hall (SUNY Orange, Middletown campus)]]]]
The downtown business district of Middletown suffered from the growth of the &quot;Miracle Mile&quot; shopping strip and Lloyd's Supermarket in the late 1960s and later two shopping malls, all located at the eastern edge of town along [[New York State Route 211|Route 211]], near [[New York State Route 17|Route 17]] and [[Interstate 84 in New York|Interstate 84]].  The Orange Plaza mall drew several of the downtown shops into it by the mid-1970s, and to the East across Route 17, the [[Galleria at Crystal Run]] opened in the early 1990s.  A Super-WalMart replaced the Orange Plaza mall in 2001.  Some of the buildings downtown are abandoned or underutilized, although there has long been an active downtown bar and restaurant scene.

The downtown area has a number of historic churches, and Highland Avenue has a number of large Victorian houses. Some of the largest Victorians are now used as nursing homes. The Middletown City Hall and City Court are located on James Street.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nycourts.gov/courts/9jd/orange/Middletown.shtml &quot;Middletown City Court&quot;], New York State Unified Court System, accessed April 5, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; There are some prosperous neighborhoods, such as Presidential Heights, but there are many less prosperous neighborhoods.   The surrounding countryside was devoted partly to small dairy farms, but this has waned since the 1980s.

Middletown is the main business address for [[Mediacom Communications Corp]] and its related entities, a cable and other pay TV company.  Their headquarters building is located outside the city in the [[Wallkill, Orange County, New York|Town of Wallkill]].

==Places of interest==
[[File:First Congregationalist Church of Middletown.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[First Congregational Church of Middletown|The First Congregational Church]], built in 1872, has the tallest spire downtown]]
Shopping in the area includes the [[Galleria at Crystal Run]], a mall just east of Middletown, and a long retail strip along Route 211 on the east side of town.&lt;ref&gt;Retail businesses in Middletown are often referenced in the phone calls of [[The Jerky Boys]], including the Route 211 [[Taco Bell]] in &quot;Civil War Memorabilia (Part 2)&quot;, from ''[[The Jerky Boys 3]]'', and the Middletown Motel and International Golf Discount in &quot;What's Wrong With This World&quot; from 2000's ''[[The Jerky Tapes]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;  The downtown area, particularly North Street and East/West Main Street, has a variety of ethnic eateries and various small shops.  A children's science museum, called The Interactive Museum,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theinteractivemuseum.com/about/ &quot;About Us&quot;], The Interactive Museum&quot;, accessed April 5, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and a number of churches are located in the neighborhood.  The city also has movie theaters, the historic [[Paramount Theatre (Middletown, New York)|Paramount Theatre]], a local arts council, bowling alleys, [[WALL]] and [[WOSR]] radio stations and Thrall Library downtown.  There are also active [[Boy Scouts of America]] and [[Girl Scouts of the USA]] chapters, as well as [[Lions Club]], [[Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks|Elks Club]], [[Kiwanis]], [[Rotary Club]] and other service clubs. The Rotary Club runs an annual [[Horse Show]] at Fancher Davidge Park each fall.  Middletown is also the site of the [[Orange County Fair (New York)|Orange County Fair]] each summer.

[[SUNY Orange]], previously known as Orange County Community College, is located in Middletown (and includes the historic [[Webb Horton House]] (pictured), more commonly known as Morrison Hall).  Orange Regional Medical Center, a hospital completed in 2011, merging the faculties of the former Horton Medical Center and Arden Hill Hospital, located at 707 East Main Street in the Town of Wallkill, is a major employer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ormcnewhospital.org/index.php?/site/news &quot;Orange Regional Completes Move Into New Hospital&quot;], Orange Regional Medical Center, accessed June 8, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hbecorp.com/content/view/43/67/ &quot;Orange Regional Medical Center: HBE Designs and Builds First Replacement Hospital in New York in 25 Years&quot;], HBE Corporation, 2009, accessed June 8, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  The local newspaper is called the ''[[Times Herald-Record]]'', the first [[cold press offset]] daily in the country.  Middletown is the site of works of two prominent architects: [[Hillside Cemetery (Middletown, New York)|Hillside Cemetery]], designed by prominent British architect and landscape designer [[Calvert Vaux]], who also designed New York City's [[Central Park]] with [[Frederick Law Olmsted]]; and J. W. Chorley Elementary School, designed by American architect [[Paul Rudolph (architect)|Paul Rudolph]], while serving as Dean of the [[Yale School of Architecture]].  The [[Highland Lakes State Park]] is the nearest State Park, and good choices for hiking, biking, and country drives are nearby.

&lt;!--Location and population--&gt;
'''Albany''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=Albany.ogg|ˈ|ɔː|l|b|ə|n|iː|}}) is the [[State capital (United States)|capital city]] of the U.S. state of [[New York]], the [[county seat|seat]] of [[Albany County, New York|Albany County]], and the central [[City (New York)|city]] of New York's [[Capital District]]. Roughly {{convert|135|mi|km}} north of the [[New York City|City of New York]], Albany sits on the west bank of the [[Hudson River]], about {{convert|10|mi|km}} south of its confluence with the [[Mohawk River]]. The population of the city was 97,856 at the time of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. Albany has close ties with the nearby cities of [[Troy, New York|Troy]], [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]], and [[Saratoga Springs, New York|Saratoga Springs]], forming a region called the Capital District. The bulk of this area is made up of the Albany-Schenectady-Troy [[United States metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]] (MSA). Its 2010 population was 870,716, the fourth-largest urban area in New York and the 58th-largest MSA in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite web |title=Largest U.S Metropolitan Areas by Population, 1990-2010 |publisher=United States Census Bureau, in ''World Almanac and Book of Facts 2012'', p. 612}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Settlement and notable achievements of the city--&gt;
Albany saw its first European settlement on November 2, 1614 and was officially chartered as a city in 1686. It became the capital of New York in 1797. It is one of the oldest surviving settlements from the original [[Thirteen Colonies|thirteen colonies]], and the longest continuously chartered city in the United States. Modern Albany was founded as the [[United Netherlands|Dutch]] trading posts of [[Fort Nassau (North River)|Fort Nassau]] in 1614 and [[Fort Orange (New Netherland)|Fort Orange]] in 1624.  The [[fur trade]] brought in a population that settled around Fort Orange and founded a village called [[Beverwijck]]. The [[Kingdom of England|English]] took over and renamed the city Albany in 1664, in honor of the then [[Duke of Albany]], the future [[James II of England|James II of England and James VII of Scotland]]. The city was officially chartered in 1686 with the issuance of the ''[[Dongan Charter]]'', the oldest effective city charter in the United States and possibly the longest-running instrument of municipal government in the [[Western Hemisphere]].&lt;ref name=fitzpatrick/&gt; Albany is one of the first cities in the world to have installed public water mains, sewer lines, natural gas lines and electricity, bringing substantial new industry to the city and surrounding area during the 19th century.
&lt;!--18th-20th century history--&gt;
During the late 18th century and throughout most of the 19th, Albany was a center of transportation. It is located on the north end of the navigable Hudson River, was the original eastern terminus of the [[Erie Canal]], and was home to some of the earliest [[History of rail transport in the United States|railroad systems]] in the world. Albany's main exports at the time were [[beer]], [[lumber]], [[publishing company|published works]], and [[ironwork]]s. Beginning in [[1810 United States Census|1810]], Albany was one of the ten most populous cities in the United States, a distinction that it held until the [[1860 United States Census|1860 census]]. In the 20th century, the city opened one of the first commercial airports in the world, the precursor of today's [[Albany International Airport]]. The 1920s saw the rise of a powerful [[political machine]] controlled by the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. The city's skyline changed in the 1960s with the construction of the [[Empire State Plaza]] and the uptown campus of [[SUNY Albany]],{{#tag:ref|The [[State University of New York at Albany]] (its official name) is also known locally as the University at Albany, SUNY Albany, UAlbany (especially when talking about athletics), and simply SUNY.|group=Note}} mainly under the direction of [[Governor of New York|Governor]] [[Nelson Rockefeller]]. While Albany experienced a decline in its population due to [[urban sprawl]], many of its historic neighborhoods were saved from destruction through the policies of [[Mayor of Albany, New York|Mayor]] [[Erastus Corning 2nd]], the longest-serving mayor of any city in the United States. More recently, the city has experienced growth in the [[high-technology industry]], with great strides in the [[nanotechnology]] sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-09-27/ibm-intel-to-invest-4-4-billion-in-new-york-state-nanotechnology.html|title=IBM, Intel Start $4.4 Billion in Chip Venture in New York|publisher=2011 BLOOMBERG L.P. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED|author=Freeman Klopott and Xu Wang|date=September 27, 2011|accessdate=October 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Current economy, and closing--&gt;
Albany has been a center of [[Higher education in the United States|higher education]] for over a century, with much of the remainder of its economy dependent on state government and [[Health care in the United States|health care]] services. The city has experienced a rebound from the [[Urban decay|urban decline]] of the 1970s and 1980s, with noticeable development happening in the city's [[Downtown Albany Historic District|downtown]] and midtown neighborhoods. Albany is known for its extensive history, culture, architecture, and institutions of higher education. The city is home to the [[mother church]]es of two Christian [[diocese]]s as well as the oldest Christian congregation in [[Upstate New York]]. Albany has won the [[All-America City Award]] in both 1991 and 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite web |title=All America City Awards: AAC Winners by State and City |publisher=National Civic League |year=2010 |accessdate=September 6, 2010 |url=http://ncl.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=130&amp;Itemid=186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Albany opened one of the first commercial airports in the world, and the first municipal airport in the United States, in 1908. Originally located on a polo field on Loudon Road, it moved to [[Westerlo Island]] in 1909 and remained there until 1928. The Albany Municipal Airport—jointly owned by the city and county—was moved to its current location in [[Colonie, New York|Colonie]] in 1928. In 1960, the mayor sold the city's stake in the airport to the county, citing budget issues. It was known from then on as Albany County Airport until a massive upgrade and modernization project between 1996 and 1998, when it was rechristened [[Albany International Airport]].&lt;ref name=Airport&gt;{{vcite web |title=Albany Airport History |publisher=Albany International Airport |last=Hakes |first=Chauncey D |url=http://www.albanyairport.com/alb_history.php |accessdate=June 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1916 Albany's northern and southern borders reached their modern courses;&lt;ref name=Appendix/&gt; [[Westerlo Island]], to the south, became the second-to-last annexation, which occurred in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite web |title=Cutting Ice: Big Business in Bethlehem |publisher=Town of Bethlehem |url=http://www.townofbethlehem.org/pages/history/historyArticlesIceCutting.asp |accessdate=September 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corning administration (1942) to present day===
[[File:Albany Institute of History and Art.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Albany Institute of History &amp; Art]] |alt=Two classic, buff colored brick buildings are connected by a modern glass and steel atrium on an urban street.]]
[[Erastus Corning 2nd]], arguably Albany's most notable mayor (and great-grandson of the former mayor of the same name), was elected in 1941.&lt;ref name=mceneny157&gt;McEneny (2006), p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; Although he was the longest serving mayor of any city in United States history (1942 until his death in 1983), one historian describes Corning's tenure as &quot;long on years, short on accomplishments,&quot;&lt;ref name=grondahl490&gt;Grondahl (2007), p. 490&lt;/ref&gt; citing Corning's preference for maintaining the status quo as a factor that held back potential progress during his tenure.&lt;ref name=grondahl500&gt;Grondahl (2007), p. 500&lt;/ref&gt; While Corning brought stability to the office of mayor, it is said that even those that idolize him cannot come up with a sizable list of &quot;major concrete Corning achievements.&quot;&lt;ref name=grondahl494&gt;Grondahl (2007), p. 494&lt;/ref&gt; Corning is given credit for saving, albeit somewhat unintentionally, much of Albany's historic architecture.{{#tag:ref|Grondahl summarizes it as, &quot;This hard-line position of isolationism on the part of the [[political machine|machine]] was a curse economically – but a strange blessing unintentionally in architectural terms. While downtown went to seed and plans for large-scale construction and improvements came to a virtual standstill in Albany without federal money, pockets of the city's historic housing stock escaped the wrecking ball.&quot;&lt;ref name=grondahl500/&gt;|group=Note}}

During the 1950s and 1960s, a time when federal aid for urban renewal was plentiful,&lt;ref name=grondahl500/&gt; Albany did not see much progress in either commerce or infrastructure. It lost more than 20 percent of its population during the Corning years, and most of the downtown businesses [[Urban sprawl|moved to the suburbs]].&lt;ref name=grondahl492&gt;Grondahl (2007), p. 492&lt;/ref&gt; While cities across the country experienced similar issues, the problems were magnified in Albany: interference from the Democratic political machine hindered progress considerably.&lt;ref name=grondahl500/&gt; Governor [[Nelson Rockefeller]] (1959–1973) ([[United States Republican Party|R]]), who had a preference for grandiose, monumental architecture and large, government-sponsored building projects, was the driving force behind the construction of the [[Empire State Plaza]], [[SUNY Albany]]'s uptown campus, and much of the [[W. Averell Harriman State Office Building Campus]].&lt;ref name=grondahl501&gt;Grondahl (2007), p. 501&lt;/ref&gt; Albany County [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Chairman Joseph C. Frangella once quipped, &quot;Governor Rockefeller was the best mayor Albany ever had.&quot;&lt;ref name=grondahl502&gt;Grondahl (2007), p. 502&lt;/ref&gt; Corning, though opposed to the project, was responsible for negotiating the payment plan for the Empire State Plaza. Rockefeller did not want to be limited by the Legislature's [[power of the purse]], so Corning devised a plan to have the county pay for the construction and have the state sign a lease-ownership agreement. The state would pay off the bonds until 2004. It was Rockefeller's only viable option, and he agreed. Due to the clout Corning gained from the situation, he was able to get the State Museum, a convention center, and a restaurant, back in the plans—ideas that Rockefeller had originally vetoed. The county gained $35 million in fees and the city received $13 million for lost tax revenue.&lt;ref name=grondahl467469&gt;Grondahl (2007), pp. 467–469&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Albany Yellow Book cropped.jpeg|thumb|This 1955 map shows the planned expansion of the [[Interstate Highway System]] around Albany.|alt=Black and white map shows the boundaries of Albany and surrounding municipalities, crossed with dark black lines representing planned interstate highways.]]

Another major project of the 1960s and 1970s was [[Interstate 787]] and the [[South Mall Arterial]].{{#tag:ref|The Empire State Plaza was originally known as the South Mall; the [[South Mall Arterial]] is the only remnant of that naming scheme.|group=Note}} Construction began in the early 1960s. One of the project's main consequences was separating the city from the Hudson River. Corning is sometimes called shortsighted with respect to use of the waterfront, as he could have used his influence to change the location of I-787, which now cuts the city off from &quot;its whole ''[[wikt:raison d'être|raison d'être]]''&quot;.&lt;ref name=grondahl498&gt;Grondahl (2007), p. 498&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the original plan never came to fruition, however: Rockefeller had wanted the South Mall Arterial to pass through the Empire State Plaza. The project would have required an underground [[trumpet interchange]] below [[Washington Park (Albany, New York)|Washington Park]], connecting to the (eventually cancelled) Mid-Crosstown Arterial.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite web | url = http://www.capitalhighways.8m.com/highways/m-ca/ | title = Mid-Crosstown Arterial | publisher = Capital Highways | year = 2006 | accessdate = June 28, 2010 | author = Jordan, Christopher}}&lt;/ref&gt; To this day, evidence of the original plan is still visible.{{#tag:ref|For example, the Plaza has [[:File:Empire State Plaza from street.jpg|four traffic tunnels]], two intended for through traffic, and two for local traffic (only the outer, local traffic tunnels are in use); the Arterial ends abruptly between Jay Street and Hudson Avenue just west of South Swan Street ({{Coord|42|39|6.17|N|73|45|43.54|W|region:US}}); the east end of the [[Dunn Memorial Bridge]] [[:File:Dunn Memorial Bridge stub end.jpg|ends abruptly]] in Rensselaer ({{Coord|42|38|33.33|N|73|44|44.78|W|region:US}}); and Henry Johnson Boulevard, which would have extended as part of the Mid-Crosstown Arterial, ends abruptly at Livingston Avenue ({{Coord|42|39|49.92|N|73|45|30.58|W|region:US}}).|group=Note}} In 1967 the hamlet of Karlsfeld became the last annexation to be added to the city limits, having come from Bethlehem.&lt;ref name=Appendix/&gt;

When Corning died in 1983, [[Thomas Michael Whalen III|Thomas Whalen]] assumed the mayorship and was reelected twice. Albany saw a significant influx of federal dollars earmarked for restoring historic structures. What Corning had saved from destruction, Whalen refurbished.&lt;ref name=mceneny191&gt;McEneny (2006), p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; The Mayor's Office of Special Events was created in an effort to increase the number of festivals and artistic events in the city, including a year-long ''Dongan Charter'' tricentennial celebration in 1986.&lt;ref name=mceneny192&gt;McEneny (2006), p. 192&lt;/ref&gt; Whalen is credited for an &quot;unparalleled cycle of commercial investment and development&quot; in Albany due to his &quot;aggressive business development programs&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite news |title=Thomas M.

Prior to the [[Early 1990s recession|recession of the 1990s]], Albany was home to two [[Fortune 500]] companies: KeyBank and Fleet Bank; both have since moved or merged with other banks.&lt;ref name=mceneny193&gt;McEneny (2006), p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; Albany saw its political climate change after the death of Corning and the retirement of Congressman [[Sam Stratton]]. Long-term office holders became a thing of the past in the 1980s. Local media began following the drama surrounding county politics (specifically that of the newly created county executive position); the loss of Corning (and eventually the machine) led to a lack of interest in city politics.&lt;ref name=mceneny193194&gt;McEneny (2006), pp. 193–194&lt;/ref&gt; The 1990s brought about the surprise election of [[Gerald Jennings]], who has been mayor since 1994.

Albany's neighborhoods are varied demographically, geographically, architecturally, and historically. [[Downtown Albany Historic District|Downtown Albany]] is the city's oldest neighborhood, centered on State Street, one of Albany's oldest streets and its original [[main street]]. Today downtown consists mostly of office buildings inhabited by state agencies, though a recent push to bring in permanent residents has led to proposed apartments and condominiums.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite news |title=Downtown Homesteading |publisher=Hearst Newspapers |work=Times Union (Albany) |date=May 13, 2010 |accessdate=March 18, 2007 |page=E1 |author=Churchill, Chris | url = http://albarchive.merlinone.net/mweb/wmsql.wm.request?oneimage&amp;imageid=6449204}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Downtown Residential | publisher = Downtown Albany Business Improvement District | url = http://www.downtownalbany.org/uploads/publications/18_DowntownResidential.pdf | accessdate = July 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; North and south of Downtown are old residential communities often consisting of [[row house]]s. North is Sheridan Hollow, [[Arbor Hill, Albany, New York|Arbor Hill]], and North Albany; to the south is the super-neighborhood of the South End, which consists of a multitude of smaller neighborhoods including the [[Mansion Historic District|Mansion District]], the [[Pastures Historic District|Pastures]], [[Kenwood, Albany, New York|Kenwood]], [[Groesbeckville, Albany, New York|Groesbeckville]], [[Delaware Avenue, Albany, New York|Delaware Avenue]], and [[Krank Park, Albany, New York|Krank Park]].&lt;ref name=neighborhoods/&gt;&lt;ref name=neighborhoodmap/&gt; These neighborhoods tend to have more minorities and lower-income residents than the western, more suburbanized sections of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite news |title=Race Tilts Middle School Debate |author=Karlin, Rick |publisher=Hearst Newspapers |work=Times Union (Albany) |date=December 22, 2002 |page=D1 |accessdate=July 14, 2010 |url= http://albarchive.merlinone.net/mweb/wmsql.wm.request?oneimage&amp;imageid=6149361}}&lt;/ref&gt;

West of Downtown is the Empire State Plaza, which effectively cuts Downtown off from the [[gentrification|gentrified]] neighborhoods of Center Square, Hudson/Park, Lark Street, and Washington Park. Collectively referred to as mid-town, these neighborhoods are often compared to New York City's [[Greenwich Village]] for their eclectic mix of residential and commercial uses, including bars, night clubs, restaurants, and unique stores.

Western neighborhoods, such as [[Pine Hills, Albany, New York|Pine Hills]], [[Delaware Avenue, Albany, New York|Delaware Avenue]], [[Whitehall, Albany, New York|Whitehall]], [[Helderberg, Albany, New York|Helderberg]], [[New Scotland, Albany, New York|New Scotland]], and [[Beverwyck, Albany, New York|Beverwyck]], tend to have larger lots and more suburban surroundings.&lt;ref name=neighborhoods&gt;{{vcite web |title=Albany's Neighborhoods |publisher=City of Albany |date= |accessdate=July 6, 2010 |url=http://www.albanyny.org/Residents/Neighborhoods.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; The eastern section of Pine Hills is a popular living choice for college students due to its proximity to the campuses of the [[College of Saint Rose]] and [[University at Albany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite web | title = Guess &quot;District&quot; Sounds Better Than Ghetto | publisher = Albany Times Union | author = Scott Waldman | page = D3 | date = March 18, 2010 | accessdate = May 24, 2010 | url = http://albarchive.merlinone.net/mweb/wmsql.wm.request?oneimage&amp;imageid=9958403}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further west, the neighborhoods become more affluent and are dominated almost exclusively by single-family dwellings. These neighborhoods, such as [[Melrose, Albany, New York|Melrose]], [[Western Pine Hills, Albany, New York|Western Pine Hills]], [[New Albany, Albany, New York|New Albany]], [[Eagle Hill, Albany, New York|Eagle Hill]], [[Westland Park, Albany, New York|Westland Park]], [[Campus, Albany, New York|Campus]], and [[Buckingham Pond, Albany, New York|Buckingham Pond]] more closely resemble neighboring areas of the suburban towns than they do the downtown parts of the city.&lt;ref name=neighborhoods/&gt; Further west is the W.

Its current location has been public property since the ''Dongan Charter'' of 1686 gave the city title to all property not privately owned. Washington Park was designed by [[John Bogart]] and John Cuyler in 1870,&lt;ref name=waite155&gt;Waite (1993), p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; and opened for public use the following year. The original lake house, designed by Frederick W. Brown, was added in 1876. The park had previously been used as a cemetery; its graves were moved to [[Albany Rural Cemetery]]. Washington Park is a popular place to exercise and play sports; skate during the winter; people-watch during [[Tulip Festival (Albany, New York)|Tulip Fest]]; and attend plays at the amphitheater during the summer.&lt;ref name=waite155/&gt;&lt;ref name=howell517518&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=6UdbEIAEit8C&amp;pg=PA517#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Howell and Tenney (1886, Vol. II), pp. 517–518]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=washparknom&gt;{{cite web |title=Washington Park Historic District |last=Brooke |first=Cornelia E. |publisher=[[New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation]] |date=May 1972 |url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=485 |accessdate=June 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=washparkcon&gt;{{cite web |title=Chronological History of Washington Park |publisher=Washington Park Conservancy |accessdate=June 1, 2010 |url=http://www.washingtonparkconservancy.org/Park_History.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Empire State Plaza]], a collection of state agency office buildings, dominates almost any view of Albany. Built between 1965 and 1978 at the hand of Governor [[Nelson A. Rockefeller]] and architect [[Wallace Harrison]], the complex is a powerful example of late American [[modern architecture]]&lt;ref name=waite8182&gt;Waite (1993), pp. 81–82&lt;/ref&gt; and remains a controversial building project both for displacing city residents and for its architectural style. The most recognizable aspect of the complex is the [[Erastus Corning Tower]], the [[List of tallest buildings in Upstate New York|tallest building in New York outside of New York City]].&lt;ref name=waite8182/&gt; Juxtaposed at the north end of the Plaza is the 19th-century [[New York State Capitol]], the seat of the [[New York State Legislature]] and the home of the [[Governor of New York|Governor's office]].&lt;ref name=waite6870&gt;Waite (1993), pp. 68–70&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Albany City Hall]], designed by [[Henry Hobson Richardson]], was opened in 1883. The New York State Capitol was opened in 1899 (after 32 years of construction)&lt;ref name=waite6870/&gt; at a cost of $25 million, making it the most expensive government building at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite web |title=Building Big: New York State Capitol |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service]] |year=2001 |url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/buildingbig/wonder/structure/ny_state_capitol.html |accessdate=June 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Albany's [[Union Station (Albany, New York)|Union Station]], a major [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] design,&lt;ref name=waite106&gt;Waite (1993), p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; was under construction at the same time; it opened in 1900.

It has a classical exterior, which features a block-long white marble [[colonnade]].&lt;ref name=waite7980&gt;Waite (1993), pp. 79–80&lt;/ref&gt; The 1920s brought the [[Art Deco]] movement, which is illustrated by the [[Home Savings Bank Building]] (1927) on North Pearl Street&lt;ref name=waite98&gt;Waite (1993), p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Alfred E.

Architecture from the 1960s and 1970s is well represented in the city, especially at the [[W. Averell Harriman State Office Building Campus]] (1950s and 1960s) and on the uptown campus of the [[University at Albany]] (1962–1971). The state office campus was planned in the 1950s by governor [[W.

Straying from the popular [[Campus|open campus layout]], SUNY Albany has a centralized building layout with administrative and classroom buildings at center surrounded by four student housing towers.

Historically, Albany's population has been mixed. First dominated by the Dutch and Germans, it was overtaken by the English in the early 19th century. Irish immigrants soon outnumbered most other ethnicities by the mid-19th century, just as Italians and [[Poles]] started moving in. The mid-to-late 20th century saw a rise in the African American population. As historian (and Albany Assemblyman) John McEneny puts it, &quot;Dutch and Yankee, German and Irish, Polish and Italian, black and Chinese—over the centuries Albany's heritage has reflected a succession of immigrant nationalities. Its streets have echoed with a dozen languages, its neighborhoods adapting to the distinctive life-style and changing economic fortunes of each new group.&quot;&lt;ref name=mceneny102&gt;McEneny (2006), p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

Until after the Revolution, Albany's population consisted mostly of Dutch descendants. Settlers moving in from New England tipped the balance toward the British in the early 19th century.&lt;ref name=mceneny103&gt;McEneny (2006), p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; Jobs on the turnpikes, canals, and railroads brought in floods of [[Irish American|Irish immigrants]] in the early 19th century, especially in the 1840s during the [[Irish potato famine]], solidifying the city's Irish base; Albany elected its first [[Irish Catholic]] mayor ([[Michael N. Nolan|Michael Nolan]]) two years before Boston did.&lt;ref name=mceneny104&gt;McEneny (2006), p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; [[Polish American|Polish]] and [[Italian American|Italian]] immigrants began arriving in Albany in the latter part of the 19th century. Their numbers were smaller than in many other eastern cities mainly because most of them had found jobs at [[General Electric]] in Schenectady.&lt;ref name=mceneny107&gt;McEneny (2006), p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; The Jewish community, present since the days of Beverwijck, also saw a rise in population during the 19th century.&lt;ref name=mceneny107/&gt; Albany saw an influx of [[Chinese American|Chinese]] and east Asian immigrants in the downtown section of the city at this time, though that population has since spread out significantly.&lt;ref name=mceneny108&gt;McEneny (2006), p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; Immigration all but halted after the [[Immigration Act of 1924]], but Albany did see its last large immigration pattern by [[Great Migration (African American)|African Americans moving in]] from the [[American South]] to fill industrial positions before [[World War I]]. As a percentage, the black community has grown substantially since then: African Americans made up 3 percent of the population in 1950, 6 percent in 1960, 12 percent in 1970, and 30 percent in 2010. This is mainly due to middle class white families moving to the suburbs and black families remaining within city limits during the same time period.&lt;ref name=mceneny111&gt;McEneny (2006), p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;{{GR|2}}

[[Streets of Albany, New York#Madison Avenue|Madison Avenue]], [[Pearl Street (Albany)|Pearl Street]], [[Delaware Avenue, Albany, New York|Delaware Avenue]] and [[Lark Street]] serve as the most active entertainment areas in the city.

Albany has a [[Mayor–council government|mayor-council form of government]], which currently functions under a charter adopted in 1998. The 1998 charter completely overwrote the original 17th-century ''[[Dongan Charter]]''. However, in an effort to keep ''Dongan'' in effect, the new charter was applied strictly as an amendment to ''Dongan'', meaning ''Dongan'' is technically still in effect, giving Albany the distinction of having the oldest active city charter in the United States and &quot;arguably the longest-running instrument of municipal government in the [[Western Hemisphere]].&quot;&lt;ref name=fitzpatrick/&gt;&lt;ref name=charter/&gt; The [[List of mayors of Albany, New York|mayor]], who is elected every four years, heads the [[Executive (government)|executive branch]] of city government.&lt;ref name=Charter2&gt;{{vcite web |title=The Charter |author=City of Albany |date=November 3, 1998 |accessdate=June 19, 2010 |url=http://www.ecode360.com/ecode3-back/getSimple.jsp?custId=AL0934&amp;guid=12064948}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current mayor, [[Gerald Jennings]], was first elected in 1993.&lt;ref name=mayor&gt;{{vcite web |title=Mayor Gerald D.

While Albany has its own city government, it has also been the seat of Albany County since the county's formation in 1683 and the capital of New York since 1797. As such, the city is home to all branches of the county and state governments, as well as its own. [[Albany City Hall]] sits on Eagle Street, opposite the State Capitol,&lt;ref name=cityhall&gt;{{vcite web |title=Welcome to City Hall |publisher=City of Albany, New York |url=http://www.albanyny.org/Government/CityHistory/CityHall.aspx |accessdate=May 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Albany County Office Building is on State Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite web |title=Departments and Offices |publisher=County of Albany, New York |url=http://www.albanycounty.com/departmentlist.asp |accessdate=May 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state government has offices scattered throughout the city.

Albany is in the [[New York's 20th congressional district|20th Congressional district]], represented by [[Paul Tonko]] (D) in the [[United States House of Representatives]]. The city is represented by [[Chuck Schumer]] (D)&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite web |title=Schumer, Charles Ellis (Chuck) |publisher=United States Congress |work=Biographical Directory of the United States Congress |url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=s000148 |accessdate=July 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kirsten Gillibrand]] (D)&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite web |title=Gillibrand, Kirsten |publisher=United States Congress |work=Biographical Directory of the United States Congress |url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=G000555 |accessdate=July 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[United States Senate]]. On the state level, the city is in the 44th district in the [[New York Senate]], represented by [[Neil Breslin]] (D). In the [[New York Assembly]], the western portion of the city is in the 109th district, represented by [[Patricia Fahy]] (D) and the eastern portion is in the 108th district, represented by [[John T.

===Politics===
Albany politics have been dominated by the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] since the 1920s; [[Daniel P. O'Connell|Daniel (Uncle Dan) O'Connell]] established a [[political machine]] in the city with the election of William Stormont Hackett as mayor in 1922.&lt;ref name =grondahl48&gt;Grondahl (2007), p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to that, William (Billy) Barnes had set up a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] machine in the 1890s. Barnes' success is attributed to the fact that he owned two newspapers in Albany and that he was the grandson of [[Thurlow Weed]], the influential newspaper publisher and political boss.&lt;ref name=grondahl165&gt;Grondahl (2007), p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; O'Connell's organization overcame Barnes' in 1922 and survived well into the 1980s (even after his death), as the machine put forth candidates for whom the electorate dutifully voted. In many instances, votes were outright bought;&lt;ref name=grondahl458&gt;Grondahl (2007), p. 458&lt;/ref&gt; it was not uncommon for the machine to &quot;buy poor folks' loyalty and trust with a [[United States five-dollar bill|fiver]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Grondahl (2007), p. 460&lt;/ref&gt;

Gerald Jennings' upset in the 1993 Democratic mayoral [[Primary election|primary]] over Harold Joyce, who had the Democratic Party's formal endorsement and had only recently been its county chairman, is often cited as the end of the O'Connell era in Albany.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite news |title=As Joyce Goes Down in Defeat, So Does the Machine |author=Jochnowitz, Jay |date=September 15, 1993 |page=A1 |work=Times Union (Albany) |publisher=Hearst Newspapers |url=http://albarchive.merlinone.net/mweb/wmsql.wm.request?oneimage&amp;imageid=5690985 |accessdate=May 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Albany continues to be dominated by the Democratic party as enrollment in the city was 38,862 in 2009 compared to Republican enrollment of 3,487.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite news |title=Albany contenders |author=O'Brien, Tim |work=Times Union (Albany) |publisher=Hearst Newspapers |date=January 10, 2009 |accessdate=May 28, 2010 |url=http://albarchive.merlinone.net/mweb/wmsql.wm.request?oneimage&amp;imageid=7354525}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gives Democrats a 10–1 advantage in the general election. Every elected city position has been held by a Democrat since 1931.&lt;ref name=mceneny201202&gt;McEneny (2006), pp. 201–202&lt;/ref&gt;

Like most cities of comparable age and size, Albany has well-established [[Catholic]], [[Protestantism|Protestant]], and [[Jew]]ish communities. Albany is home to the oldest Christian congregation in Upstate New York and the [[Mother Church]]es of two Christian [[dioceses]]. {{As of|2010|06}}, eight churches or religious buildings in the city were listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places in Albany County, New York|National Register of Historic Places]],&lt;ref name=nrhp&gt;{{vcite web |title=National Register of Historic Places: Weekly List Actions |publisher=[[National Park Service]], [[United States Department of the Interior]] |accessdate=June 19, 2010 |date=June 18, 2010 |url=http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/nrlist.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of which—[[St. Peter's Episcopal Church (Albany, New York)|St. Peter's Episcopal Church]] on State Street—is a [[National Historic Landmark]].&lt;ref name=nhl&gt;{{vcite web |author=National Park Service |author-link = National Park Service |title=National Historic Landmarks Survey: Database |publisher=U.S. Department of the Interior |url=http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/default.cfm |accessdate=September 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant Jewish presence has existed in Albany since as early as 1658,&lt;ref name=Judaica/&gt; and today includes many [[synagogue]]s; there are two [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]], a [[Chabad|Chabad-Lubavitch]], an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]], and two [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] synagogues.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite web |title=Synagogues in Albany |publisher=MavenSearch (Jewish Web Directory) |url=http://www.mavensearch.com/synagogues/C3329Y3783RX |accessdate=June 22, 2010 |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Albany is also home to one of the few [[Karaite Judaism|Karaite]] synagogues outside [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite web |title=Homepage |publisher=Karaite Jewish Congregation Oraḥ Ṣaddiqim |year=2010 |accessdate=June 22, 2010 |url=http://www.orahsaddiqim.org/}} ''This link is not active during [[Shabbat]], which begins on Friday at sundown, [[Eastern Time Zone|local time]], and ends the following Saturday night.''&lt;/ref&gt; The city has a membership of between 12,000 and 13,000.&lt;ref name=Judaica&gt;{{vcite web | title = Albany (re-published from Encyclopedia Judaica) | url = http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0001_0_00672.html | publisher = The American-Israeli Cooperative Enterprise | accessdate = June 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exact numbers on religious denominations in Albany are not readily available. Demographic statistics in the United States depend heavily on the [[United States Census Bureau]], which cannot ask about religious affiliation as part of its [[United States Census|decennial census]].&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite web |title=Religion |publisher=United States Census Bureau |accessdate=June 22, 2010 |url=http://www.census.gov/prod/www/religion.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; It does compile some national and state-wide religious statistics,&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite web |title=The 2010 Statistical Abstract (Population: Religion) |publisher=United States Census Bureau |year=2010 |accessdate=June 22, 2010 |url=http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/cats/population/religion.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; but these are not representative of a city the size of Albany. One report from 2000 offers religious affiliations for Albany County. According to the data, 59.2% of Albany County residents identified as [[Christianity|Christian]]: 47% are [[Roman Catholicism in the United States|Roman Catholic]], 8.4% are [[mainline Protestant]]s, 2.7% are [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Protestants]], and 1.1% are [[Orthodox Church|Eastern]] or [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental]] Orthodox Christians.

[[Interstate 787]] links Albany to Watervliet, Colonie, and Menands; by way of [[New York State Route 7|Route 7]], I-787 connects to the Northway, offering [[Saratoga County]] residents a rather direct, albeit [[traffic congestion|congested]] route to and from Albany during [[rush hour]].&lt;ref name=googlemaps&gt;{{google maps |url=http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&amp;ll=42.694801,-73.840313&amp;spn=0.072041,0.181789&amp;t=h&amp;z=13 |title=Albany, New York, United States |accessdate=June 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Albany, long an important Hudson River port, today serves domestic and international ships and barges through the [[Port of Albany-Rensselaer]], located on both sides of the river. The port has the largest mobile harbor crane in the state of New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite web |title = I-87 Multimodal Corridor Study. | publisher = Parsons-Clough Harbour and [[NYSDOT]] | accessdate = January 3, 2009 | url = https://www.dot.ny.gov/regional-offices/region1/project-repository/i87MultiModalStudy/documents/chapter_2-11_intermodal_facilities_and_operations.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[New York State Barge Canal]], the ultimate successor of the Erie Canal, is in use today, largely by tourist and private boats.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite web |title=History and Education |publisher=[[New York State Canal Corporation]] |date= |accessdate=September 6, 2010 |url=http://www.canals.ny.gov/cculture/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the closure of [[Union Station (Albany, New York)|Union Station]] on Broadway, area passenger-rail service is provided by [[Amtrak]] at the [[Albany-Rensselaer (Amtrak station)|Albany-Rensselaer station]] in Rensselaer. In 2009, the station saw more than 720,000 passengers, making it Amtrak's second-busiest in New York, behind [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|New York's Penn Station]].&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite web |title=Amtrak Fact Sheet, Fiscal Year 2009 – State of New York |publisher=[[Amtrak]] |accessdate=June 2, 2010 |url=http://www.amtrak.com/pdf/factsheets/NEWYORK09.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Albany's nearest airport is [[Albany International Airport]] in Colonie. Six [[List of airlines of the United States|major airlines]] service Albany: [[Air Canada]] (which offers the airport's only international destination, [[Toronto, Ontario|Toronto]]), [[Cape Air]], [[Delta Air Lines]], [[Southwest Airlines]], [[United Air Lines]], and [[US Airways]]; [[Million Air]] is the local [[fixed base operator]].&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite web |title=Airlines and Destinations |publisher=Albany International Airport |url=http://www.albanyairport.com/alb_airlines.php |accessdate=June 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Albany had the highest average airfare in New York, though the per-mile cost on its busiest routes was second-lowest in the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite news |title=Albany had highest average air fare in state, DOT study finds |author=Anderson, Eric |publisher=Hearst Newspapers |work=Times Union (Albany) |date=August 2, 2010 |accessdate=August 2, 2010 |url=http://blog.timesunion.com/business/albany-had-highest-average-air-fare-in-state-dot-study-finds/20768/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sister cities==
Albany has five official [[sister city]] agreements and two other twin-city relationships. The city of [[Nijmegen, Netherlands]] connected with Albany following [[World War II]]. With the help of the catholic university in Albany, the Catholic University of Nijmegen ([[Radboud University Nijmegen]]) rebuild it's partly destroyed library, with over 50,000 books being donated to the Dutch university. To show its gratitude for post-war assistance, the city sent Albany 50,000 [[tulip bulb]]s in 1948; this act led to the establishment of the annual Tulip Festival.&lt;ref name=mceneny192&gt;McEneny (2006), p. 192&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the other connections were made in the 1980s during Mayor Whalen's term in office as part of his cultural expansion program.&lt;ref name=mceneny192/&gt; The official sister cities are:&lt;ref name=sisters&gt;{{vcite web |title=Sister City US Listings |publisher=Sister Cities International |url=http://www.sister-cities.org/directory/index.cfm |accessdate=April 25, 2010}} ''Note: Permalinking to search results is not possible.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33547">The '''towns and cities of Downstate New York''' were created by the [[US state]] of [[New York]] as [[municipalities]] in order to give residents more direct say over local government.&lt;ref name=Law1788/&gt; Present-day [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], [[Bronx County, New York|Bronx]], [[New York County, New York|New York]], [[Richmond County, New York|Richmond]], [[Kings County, New York|Kings]], [[Queens County, New York|Queens]], [[Nassau County, New York|Nassau]], and [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk]] counties were part of [[York Shire (Province of New York)|York Shire]] from 1664-August 1673 and again from February 1674 until 1683 at which point the [[Province of New York]] was divided into counties. From August 1673 to February 1674 New York was under [[United Netherlands|Dutch]] control and [[Kingdom of England|English]] political units were suspended, then restored under English rule.&lt;ref name=Shire&gt;{{Cite book| url = http://books.google.com/books?id=ggQKAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PR12&amp;dq=yorkshire+new+york+1664&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=5MOWTNXzFIP7lwfO98GkCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=shire&amp;f=false | pages = 101–4 &amp; 122 | title = The Colonial Laws of the State of New York From 1664 to the Revolution, Including the Charters to the Duke of York, the Commissions and Instructions to the Colonial Governors, the Duke's Laws, the Laws of Dongan and Leisler Assemblies, the Charters of Albany and New York and the Acts of the Colonial Legislatures from 1691 to 1775 Inclusive. | volume = I | year = 1894 | publisher = James B.

In 1683 the state eliminated shires and ridings in favor of counties,&lt;ref name=Shire/&gt; the East Riding becoming Suffolk County, West Riding the counties of Richmond and Kings, while the North Riding became the counties of Westchester (including present-day Bronx), New York, and Queens (including present-day Nassau).&lt;ref name= Shire/&gt;

New York experimented with different types of municipalities before settling upon the current format of [[administrative divisions of New York#Town|towns]] and [[Administrative divisions of New York#City|cities]] occupying all the land in a county,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Governmental Units | url = http://brookhavensouthhaven.org/GovernmentalUnits.htm | publisher = John B.

[[Orange, New York|Town of Orange]]''), towns gained [[home rule]] powers from the state in 1964, at which time towns became &quot;a municipal corporation comprising the inhabitants within its boundaries, and formed with the purpose of exercising such powers and discharging such duties of local government and administration of public affairs as have been, or, maybe ''[[sic|[sic]]]'' conferred or imposed upon it by law.”&lt;ref name=Manual&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.dos.state.ny.us/lg/publications/Local_Government_Handbook.pdf | |title=Local Government Handbook | format = PDF | pages=60 (PDF 64) | publisher = New York State Department of State | year = 2008, 5th edition | accessdate = 2010-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following time-line shows the creation of the current towns from their predecessors stretching back to the earliest municipal entity over the area. It represents from which old town(s) a particular new town was created, but does not represent annexations of territory to and from towns that already existed. All municipalities are towns unless otherwise noted as patent, township, borough, district, or city.

All municipalities are towns unless otherwise noted as patent, township, borough, district, or city.

*Prior to the creation of [[Onondaga County, New York|Onondaga County]] the western section of [[Herkimer County, New York|Herkimer County]] was the [[Military Tract of Central New York|Military Tract]]. This tract included present-day Onondaga, [[Cayuga County, New York|Cayuga]], and [[Seneca County, New York|Seneca]] counties, and parts of [[Oswego County, New York|Oswego]], [[Tompkins, New York|Tompkins]], and [[Wayne, New York|Wayne]]; and was divided into 25 [[townships]] for surveying purposes to provide land for [[veteran]]s of the [[US Revolutionary War]]. Three more townships were created in order to settle all claims.&lt;ref name=French/&gt; Originally simply numbered, they latter received names, mostly classical Greek and Roman names. In creating Onondaga County in 1794 the state of New York combined the townships into 11 towns.&lt;ref name=Military/&gt; Milton (17), Locke (18), Scipio (12), Sempronius (13), Cato (3), Brutus (4), and Aurelius (8) were the townships in present-day Cayuga County, which were combined in 1794 into the towns of Milton (Milton and Locke townships), Scipio (Scipio and Sempronius townships), and Aurelius (Cato, Brutus, and Aurelius townships).

;Notes
*Prior to the creation of [[Onondaga County, New York|Onondaga County]] the western section of [[Herkimer County, New York|Herkimer County]] was the [[Military Tract of Central New York|Military Tract]]. This tract included present-day Onondaga, [[Cayuga County, New York|Cayuga]], and [[Seneca County, New York|Seneca]] counties, and parts of [[Oswego County, New York|Oswego]], [[Tompkins, New York|Tompkins]], and [[Wayne, New York|Wayne]]; and was divided into 25 [[townships]] for surveying purposes to provide land for [[veteran]]s of the [[US Revolutionary War]]. Three more townships were created in order to settle all claims.&lt;ref name=French/&gt; Originally simply numbered, they latter received names, mostly classical Greek and Roman names. In creating Onondaga County in 1794 the state of New York combined the townships into 11 towns.&lt;ref name=Military/&gt; Pompey (10), Tully (14), Fabius (15), Manlius (7), Camillus (5), and Marcellus (9) occupied present-day Onondaga, and were combined as the towns of Pompey (Pompey, Tully, and Fabius townships), Marcellus (Camillus and Marcellus townships), and Manlius.&lt;ref name=French/&gt;

{{Regions of New York}}
The '''towns and cities of New York's North Country''' were created by the [[US state]] of [[New York]] as [[municipalities]] in order to give residents more direct say over local government.&lt;ref name=Law1788&gt;{{Cite book| title = Laws of the State of New York Passed at the Sessions of the Legislature Held in the Years 1785, 1786, 1787 and 1788, inclusive, Being the Eight, Ninth, Tenth and Eleventh, sessions. | volume =II | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=GBWxAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA748&amp;dq=an+act+for+dividing+the+counties+of+this+state+into+towns&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=1#v=onepage&amp;q=an%20act%20for%20dividing%20the%20counties%20of%20this%20state%20into%20towns&amp;f=false | page = 103 &amp; 748 | publisher = Weed, Parsons and Company/State of New York | year = 1886 | accessdate = 2010-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[North Country, New York|North Country]] consists of [[Clinton County, New York|Clinton County]], [[Essex County, New York|Essex County]], [[Franklin County, New York|Franklin County]], [[Jefferson County, New York|Jefferson County]], [[Lewis County, New York|Lewis County]], and [[St. Lawrence County, New York|St. Lawrence County]]. When counties were first formed in 1683 the entire area was theoretically under the jurisdiction of [[Albany County, New York|Albany County]] though actually wilderness inhabited by [[Indigenous peoples of North America|Native Americans]], by 1764 most of the area became effectively controlled by Albany County. The state would sell off this land to settlers and speculators, most notably as part of the Old Military Tract (1786) to veterans of the [[US Revolutionary War]] and as [[Macomb's Purchase]] (1791) to [[Alexander Macomb (American merchant)|Alexander Macomb]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.franklincony.org/content/History | title = Franklin County:History | publisher = Franklin County | accessdate = 2010-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1772 the northern and western portions of Albany County was divided into two counties&amp;ndash; [[Tryon County, New York|Tryon]] and [[Charlotte County, Province of New York|Charlotte]]. Tryon encompassed Lewis, Jefferson, and St. Lawrence counties along with the western section of Franklin; Tryon was renamed [[Montgomery County, New York|Montgomery]] in 1784. Charlotte encompassed Clinton, Essex, and the majority of Franklin County; the name of the county was changed to [[Washington County, New York|Washington County]] in 1784. In 1788 Clinton County was split from Washington, Essex was formed from Clinton in 1799 and Franklin was formed from Clinton in 1808. Montgomery County's North Country area went to [[Herkimer County, New York|Herkimer County]] on that county's formation in 1791, but western Franklin and eastern St. Lawrence were returned to Montgomery in 1797. In 1798 Lewis, Jefferson, and western St. Lawrence became part of the newly formed [[Oneida County, New York|Oneida County]] from Herkimer in 1798, leaving only central St. Lawrence County as part of Herkimer. In 1801 the future St. Lawrence and Franklin counties which were portions of Montgomery, Herkimer, and Oneida were transferred to Clinton County; the next year in 1802 St. Lawrence was formed as a county. In 1805 both Lewis and Jefferson counties were formed from Oneida County.&lt;ref name=Map&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mynewyorkgenealogy.com/ny-maps.html | title = New York County Maps and Atlases | publisher = Genealogy, Inc. | accessdate = 2010-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1785 the township of [[Plattsburgh (town), New York|Plattsburgh]] was formed in Washington County, and the next year all of Washington County was divided into townships, including the formation of [[Crown Point, New York|Crown Point]] township which included all of future Essex County while Plattsburgh was expanded to include most of future Clinton County and Franklin counties.&lt;ref name=Law1788/&gt; Towns in Franklin can all be traced back to [[Chateaugay (town), New York|Chateaugay]], formed in 1799 a descendant of Plattsburgh. All the towns of Jefferson and Lewis counties can be traced back to [[Whitestown, New York|Whitestown]] a town formed in Montgomery County in 1788. In 1801, a year before St. Lawrence County was formed the area of the county, which was 10 [[survey township]]s, was combined as the town of [[Lisbon, New York|Lisbon]], all towns in the county are descended from Lisbon.&lt;ref name=French/&gt;

New York experimented with different types of municipalities before settling upon the current format of [[administrative divisions of New York#Town|towns]] and [[Administrative divisions of New York#City|cities]] occupying all the land in a county,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Governmental Units | url = http://brookhavensouthhaven.org/GovernmentalUnits.htm | publisher = John B. Deitz | accessdate = May 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and all previous forms were transformed into towns (or divided into multiple towns) in 1788 when all of the state of New York was divided into towns.&lt;ref name=Law1788/&gt; Some early forms of government in earlier years included land patents with some municipal rights, districts,&lt;ref name=District&gt;{{cite book | title = The Colonial Laws of the State of New York From 1664 to the Revolution, Including the Charters to the Duke of York, the Commissions and Instructions to the Colonial Governors, the Duke's Laws, the Laws of Dongan and Leisler Assemblies, the Charters of Albany and New York and the Acts of the Colonial Legislatures from 1691 to 1775 Inclusive. | page = 383 and 395 | volume = V | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=gqqwAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA353&amp;dq=colonial+laws+of+new+york+vol+4&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=1#v=onepage&amp;q=1772%20district&amp;f=false | accessdate = 2009-09-01 | year = 1894 | publisher = James B.

[[Orange, New York|Town of Orange]]''), towns gained [[home rule]] powers from the state in 1964, at which time towns became &quot;a municipal corporation comprising the inhabitants within its boundaries, and formed with the purpose of exercising such powers and discharging such duties of local government and administration of public affairs as have been, or, maybe ''[[sic|[sic]]]'' conferred or imposed upon it by law.”&lt;ref name=Manual&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.dos.state.ny.us/lg/publications/Local_Government_Handbook.pdf|title=Local Government Handbook | format = PDF | pages=60 (PDF 64) | publisher = New York State Department of State | year = 2008, 5th edition | accessdate = 2010-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following is a timeline showing the creation of the current towns from their predecessors stretching back to the earliest municipal entity over the area. The timelines only represent which town(s) a particular town was created from and does not represent annexations of territory to and from towns that already existed. All municipalities are towns unless otherwise noted as patent, township, borough, district, or city.

In the [[Hudson Valley]], these divisions included [[Dutchess County, New York|Dutchess]], [[Orange County, New York|Orange]], and [[Ulster County, New York|Ulster]] counties. Dutchess and Orange remained unorganized until 1713, with Dutchess administered from Ulster;{{sfn|French|1860|p=267}} Orange would be administered from [[New York County, New York|New York County]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.genealogyinc.com/new-york/maps/ | title = New York County Maps and Atlases | publisher = Genealogy, Inc | accessdate = 2010-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Future counties would be formed and towns exchanged over time, with [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]] split from Orange in 1799, at which time the southern towns of Ulster were transferred to Orange as compensation for the loss; and [[Putnam County, New York|Putnam County]] from Dutchess in 1812, these county's towns can trace their origins to towns and precincts that were formed in their parent counties.{{sfn|French|1860|p=267}} Another change that occurred was the transfer of Dutchess County's northern section, the [[Livingston Manor]], to [[Columbia County, New York|Columbia County]]. [[Greene County, New York|Greene County]] was formed in 1800 by the combination of the southernmost towns of [[Albany County, New York|Albany County]] with the northernmost towns of Ulster. The history of the towns of Greene and Columbia counties can be found at the [[Timeline of town creation in New York's Capital District]].

New York experimented with different types of municipalities before settling upon the current format of [[administrative divisions of New York#Town|towns]] and [[Administrative divisions of New York#City|cities]] occupying all the land in a county,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Governmental Units | url = http://brookhavensouthhaven.org/GovernmentalUnits.htm | publisher = Deitz, John B. | accessdate = 2009-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and all previous forms were transformed into towns (or divided into multiple towns) in 1788 when all of the state of New York was divided into towns.&lt;ref name=Law1788/&gt; Some early forms of government in earlier years included land patents with some municipal rights, districts,&lt;ref name=District&gt;{{cite book | title = The Colonial Laws of the State of New York From 1664 to the Revolution, Including the Charters to the Duke of York, the Commissions and Instructions to the Colonial Governors, the Duke's Laws, the Laws of Dongan and Leisler Assemblies, the Charters of Albany and New York and the Acts of the Colonial Legislatures from 1691 to 1775 Inclusive | page = 383 and 395 | volume = V | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=gqqwAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA353&amp;dq=colonial+laws+of+new+york+vol+4&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=1#v=onepage&amp;q=1772%20district&amp;f=false | accessdate = 2009-09-01 | year = 1894 | publisher = James B.

[[Orange, New York|Town of Orange]]''), towns gained [[home rule]] powers from the state in 1964, at which time towns became &quot;a municipal corporation comprising the inhabitants within its boundaries, and formed with the purpose of exercising such powers and discharging such duties of local government and administration of public affairs as have been, or, maybe ''[[sic|[sic]]]'' conferred or imposed upon it by law.”&lt;ref name=Manual&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.dos.state.ny.us/lg/publications/Local_Government_Handbook.pdf  |title=Local Government Handbook | format = PDF | pages=60 (PDF 64) | publisher = New York State Department of State | year = 2008, 5th edition | accessdate = 2010-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following is a timeline showing the creation of the current towns from their predecessors stretching back to the earliest municipal entity over the area. The timelines only represent which town(s) a particular town was created from and do not represent annexations of territory to and from towns that already existed. All municipalities are towns unless otherwise noted as patent, township, borough, district, or city.
