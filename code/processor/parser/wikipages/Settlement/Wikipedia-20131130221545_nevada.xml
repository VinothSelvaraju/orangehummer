'''Lovelock''' is the county seat of [[Pershing County, Nevada|Pershing County]], [[Nevada]], in which it is the only incorporated city. It is the namesake of a nearby [[Lovelock Correctional Center|medium-security men's prison]] and a [[Cold War]]-era [[Black Rock Desert Gunnery Range|gunnery range]]. Formerly a stop for [[California Gold Rush|settlers on their way to California]] and later a train depot, the town's economy is now based primarily on tourism and employment at the prison.

==Geography==
Lovelock lies in the [[Humboldt River]] Basin, very near the terminus of the river. Some twenty miles outside the town is the [[Lovelock Cave|Lovelock Native Cave]], a horseshoe-shaped cave of about {{convert|35|ft|m|abbr=on|adj=mid|width}} and {{convert|150|ft|m|abbr=on|adj=mid|length}} where Northern [[Paiute]] natives anciently deposited a number of duck decoys and other artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nevadabeautiful.com/pony-express/lovelock-caves-lovelock-nevada.html &quot;Lovelock Caves, Lovelock Nevada&quot;] NevadaBeautiful.com, Retrieved 14 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|0.9|sqmi|km2}}, all of it land. It has four differently designed welcome signs with pioneer and [[Wild West]] themes placed on its approach roads.

==Demographics==
As of the [[census]]{{GR|2}} of 2000, there were 2,003 people, 778 households, and 493 families residing in the city. The [[population density]] was 2,311.6 people per square mile (888.9/km²). There were 951 housing units at an average density of 1,097.5 per square mile (422.0/km²). The racial makeup of the city was 76.49% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 0.80% [[African American (U.S. Census)|African American]], 7.14% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 0.70% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], 0.20% [[Pacific Islander (U.S. Census)|Pacific Islander]], 10.03% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]], and 4.64% from two or more races. [[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]] of any race were 24.21% of the population.

There were 778 households out of which 33.5% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 47.8% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 9.3% had a female householder with no husband present, and 36.6% were non-families. 31.5% of all households were made up of individuals and 12.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.52 and the average family size was 3.22.

In the city the population was spread out with 31.2% under the age of 18, 7.5% from 18 to 24, 27.2% from 25 to 44, 20.9% from 45 to 64, and 13.3% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 34 years. For every 100 females there were 107.8 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 105.2 males.

The median income for a household in the city was $34,563, and the median income for a family was $40,885. Males had a median income of $35,658 versus $27,371 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the city was $17,233. About 9.6% of families and 14.2% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 18.9% of those under age 18 and 10.3% of those age 65 or over. The majority rely on agriculture and mining for their income.

==History==
The area in which the township of Lovelock was to be established first came to prominence as a lush way station on the Humboldt Trail to California. According to an 1849 description of what were then called the Big Meadows, &quot;This marsh for three miles is certainly the liveliest place that one could witness in a lifetime. There is some two hundred and fifty wagons here all the time. Trains going out and others coming in and taking their places is the constant order of the day. Cattle and mules by the hundreds are surrounding us, in grass to their knees, all discoursing sweet music with the grinding of their jaws.”&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in David W. Toll, ''A brief Description &amp; History of Lovelock, Nevada'', [http://www.nevadaweb.com/cnt/cc/lovelock.html available online]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The Humboldt River near Lovelock.JPG|left|260px|thumb|The Humboldt River near Lovelock]]
A few settlers stopped on there to harvest the wild rye growing in the meadows and scythe the hay each fall, which they then sold on. Arriving there from California in 1866, the English settler George Lovelock (1824–1907) bought the squatters' right for 320 acres and got with it the oldest water rights on the Humboldt River. Although born in [[Wales]], Lovelock was from a family of [[Wiltshire]] origin that is known to family historians as the Lyneham Line.&lt;ref&gt;Sue Lovelock, ''From Wiltshire to Nevada – tracing the Lovelock connection'', Lovelock Lines 4, January 2006 [http://lovelock.free.fr/l-lines/lovelock-lines-4th-ed.pdf  pp.3-5]&lt;/ref&gt; His brother Daniel moved to [[Australia]] - and one of Daniel's sons to [[New Zealand]] - so that the relations of the man after whom the Nevada town was named are now widely scattered.

The town's foundation came about with the building of the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] through the area in August 1868. George Lovelock provided 85 acres for the site and the depot was therefore named 'Lovelock's' after him and appears as such on old maps.&lt;ref&gt;An early example is on Mitchell's [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/1872_Mitchell_Map_of_Utah_and_Nevada_-_Geographicus_-_UTNV-mitchell-1872.jpg map of Nevada] (1872)&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter he put his mining expertise to work and discovered many valuable lodes in the surrounding area, which contributed to enhanced railway traffic. He also acted as the town's first postmaster and invested in hotels. In particular he was the first proprietor of the Big Meadows Hotel on Main Street, adjacent to the train station and what was eventually the [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound Bus]] depot.

By 1900, the town of Lovelock had a school, churches and a business district along what was then called Railway Street - later renamed West Broadway.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Wren, ''A History of the State of Nevada: Its Resources and People'', Lewis Publishing Company 1904 [http://www.ksgennet.org/nv/pr/bios/lovelockgeorge.html available online]&lt;/ref&gt; Also included among the businesses were no less than three weekly newspapers: The ''Lovelock Tribune'', which ran from May 1898 until February 1912; the short-lived ''Lovelock Standard'' (April–September 1900); and ''The Argus'' (May 1900-Jan 1905). In August 1908 the weekly ''Lovelock Review'' was founded, becoming ''Lovelock Review-Miner'' in January 1911 and remaining under that name to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;Richard E. Lingenfelter, Karen Rix Gash, ''The newspapers of Nevada: a history and bibliography, 1854-1979'', University of Nevada 1984 [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=PQqhz7JSQZUC&amp;pg=PA146&amp;lpg=PA146&amp;dq=lovelock+review+miner+newspaper&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MbOFfGdKAA&amp;sig=sXI4C0yllVg373XBgcK7eR_L4Pw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=PgWvTr3CHI-m8gPcsdixCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CF0Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=lovelock%20&amp;f=false pp.144-7]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lovelock77.jpg|right|thumb|285px|Downtown Main Street and Cornell Avenue]]

Lovelock was incorporated as a city in 1917 and in 1919 it was named the county seat when Pershing County was carved out of the southern part of Humboldt County. Its famous round Court House was built at the end of Main Street, on the site of a school, which was then located elsewhere. While mining and agriculture acted as the commercial centre for the locality, the community thrived on the state speciality of gambling, with many casinos and [[List of brothels in Nevada|three legalised brothels]], although all of the latter are now closed. The town’s centenary was celebrated in 1968 with a Frontier Days theme suggested by two of the founder’s great-great granddaughters, Elaine Pommerening and Pat Rowe, who had only recently moved back to Lovelock. In 1983, [[Nevada State Route 396|old U.S. Route 40]] through downtown was bypassed by [[Interstate 80 in Nevada|Interstate 80]], and in the early 1990s the rail depot closed, killing much of its prosperity. Since then it has promoted itself as a tourist attraction with its historic buildings and special events.

There have been several mining booms in the neighbouring mountains. These included intensive activity in the [[Rochester, Nevada|Rochester]] and [[Seven Troughs Range|Seven Troughs]] areas at the start of the 20th century and subsequent drilling with more advanced techniques later in Rochester. The Coeur Rochester mine began further open cast mining for silver and gold in 2011,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coeur.com/operations/rochester-nevada#.UkQ_Nn-57ec Coeur.com]&lt;/ref&gt; test drilling for gold continues at Relief Canyon,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pershinggold.com/projects/relief-canyon-mine-project-nevada Pershing Gold Co.]&lt;/ref&gt; and diatomite is dug at the Colado Mine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mines.findthedata.org/l/40370/Colado-Mine Mine data online]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tourism==
Among the tourist events figure the I.D.E.S. Portuguese festival in May and what became the annual Frontier Days weekend in July. There are also hot air balloon races (Lovers Aloft, inaugurated in February 2004) and the Lovelock Street Fever car show, begun in June 2007. A major draw is the Lovers Lock Plaza in the shaded area at the back of the Court House where couples symbolise their love by attaching a padlock to an 'endless chain', a practice begun on Valentine’s Day, 2005.&lt;ref name=CoC&gt;{{cite web |url=http://loverslock.com/ |title=The perfect romantic gift idea. &quot;Locking your love&quot; in Lovelock, Nevada. |publisher=Lovelock/Pershing County Chamber of Commerce |accessdate=2010-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year saw the construction of a dirt-racing track known as the Lovelock Speedway.&lt;ref&gt;{{dmoz|Regional/North_America/United_States/Nevada/Localities/L/Lovelock}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lovelock's heritage buildings include the wooden built Grace Methodist Church on the corner of Cornell Avenue and 8th Street, dating from 1886. It was destroyed by fire in 1922 and the tower was rebuilt without the original spire; in 1983 the church was badly damaged by another fire and was restored again. [[Marzen House]] Museum is another Victorian building, built in 1874. The Italianate farmhouse was transported from Big Meadow Ranch in the 1980s and has on its site an assay office, farm machinery sheds, and buildings housing vintage automobiles, while inside it contains 1800s furnishings and a museum, shedding light on the area’s history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://museums.travelnevada.com/destination/marzen-house-museum.aspx Online information]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Pershingcourt.JPG|thumb|left|285px|Pershing County Court House in Lovelock]]
Among so much that that has been otherwise torn down and not replaced in the town, the Longhorn Bar beside the tracks on West Broadway is one of the few remaining commercial buildings in typical Nevada style. Not far away is the [[Central Pacific Railroad Depot (Lovelock, Nevada)|railroad depot]] dating from 1880. In 1999 it was presented to the town by the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] to be restored and moved to another lot for use as an eatery. This was registered as a historic building in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pdfhost.focus.nps.gov/docs/NRHP/Text/04000300.pdf Registration online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Pride of place goes to the distinctive [[Pershing County Courthouse]], dating from 1919. Julie Nicoletta describes the circimstances: 'Pershing County officials approached [[Frederic Joseph DeLongchamps]], by then the architect of six Nevada courthouses, and asked for a design that would be low in price but distinctive in appearance. As a solution, DeLongchamps designed a round courthouse, patterning it after [[Thomas Jefferson Library|Thomas Jefferson's library]] at the [[University of Virginia]] campus. The circle-over-hexagon design includes a circular interior hallway and a round courtroom decorated with [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] [[pilasters]]. A broad, sweeping concrete staircase leads to the main floor of the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts classical structure]]. Its entrance includes a pedimented portico supported by six [[Ionic order|Ionic]] columns. [[Doric order|Doric]] pilasters separate the main story windows. Cream-colored brick and [[terracotta]] finish the exterior. A shallow dome crowns the roof and provides the courtroom with a dramatic, soaring ceiling.'&lt;ref&gt;Julie Nicoletta, ''Buildings of Nevada'', Oxford University Press USA, 2000, ISBN 0-19-514139-3&lt;/ref&gt;

A tourist attraction of a completely different kind, the [[Lovelock Correctional Center]] was opened in 1995 and is best known for the fact that in 2008 [[O.J. Simpson]] began a prison sentence there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2008/dec/19/oj-tranferred-lovelock/ &quot;O.J. transferred to Lovelock&quot;] LasVegasSun.com, 19 December 2008, Retrieved 29 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lovelock in song and story==
There is something about the resonance of the town's name that has appealed to song writers. It is referenced on the debut album of the folk-rock band Center Divide, ''Lovelock to Winnemucca'' (1998), a title drawn from the opening lines of the first song there, &quot;Lovelock&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centerdivide.com/lovelock.htm Lyrics]&lt;/ref&gt; The sad lyrics contemplate lost love as the car speeds down the bleak highway between the Nevada towns.
[[File:CowpokeCafeLovelock.jpg||thumb|250px|The Cowpoke Cafe in Lovelock]]
The wry “Limbo in Lovelock”, first performed in 2005 by the [[Hot Buttered Rum (band)|Hot Buttered Rum]] String Band,&lt;ref&gt;There is a performance on the [http://www.archive.org/details/HBRSB2005-06-24.flac16 Internet Live Music Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; was eventually recorded on their ''Live in the Northeast'' CD (2007). Although at first a stopover in the town is made to sound like a doorway to hell, the mood changes at the end.
:::Well just outside of nowhere, mile marker 105,
:::You'll find yourself in Lovelock where the game’s to stay alive;
:::Get yourself a burger down at the Cowpoke Café,
:::Where the gals have quite a smile, it's the special of the day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.morebutter.net/missyslist/song_details.php?id=29 The full lyrics]&lt;/ref&gt;

Interviewed about the meaning of this verse, one of the band reminisced that they had stopped at the diner and noticed a sign on the counter 'explaining the special of the day. The girls working there were teenagers and full of smiles and good cheer. It was very welcome after a trying day on the road. I'd say the girls' smiles were the special of the day because they really cheered us up.'&lt;ref&gt;''Butter Times&quot; 6 (Fall 2005) [http://www.hotbutteredrum.net/pdf/BT6.pdf p.3]&lt;/ref&gt;

“Lovelock” is also the second track on Pitch Black‘s second album, ''This is the Modern Sound'' (Revelation Records, 2005).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myspace.com/pitchblacknz/music/albums/this-is-the-modern-sound-11015484 Listen online]&lt;/ref&gt; Though the words are difficult to make out, a review informs us that this is a typically punk ‘us against the world anthem’.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogcritics.org/music/article/review-pitch-black-this-is-the Read online]&lt;/ref&gt; Other songs referencing mining towns and imagery explain why the name &quot;Lovelock&quot; was chosen.

A stopover in the town is the subject of Fred Leebron's prize-winning short story “Lovelock”, originally published in ''[[Ploughshares]]'' magazine in 1993. An ex-convict staying overnight at a Lovelock motel picks up a retarded woman and guiltily sees her and her sister off in their car the next morning. Leebron explains that the inspiration for the story 'comes from a brief encounter I had in New Orleans in 1985 and an overnight stay I made in Nevada four years later. I began writing a novel that contains &quot;Lovelock&quot; as a chapter in the spring of 1992.'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pshares.org/read/article-detail.cfm?intArticleID=3716 Magazine website]&lt;/ref&gt;
The story was reprinted in the anthology ''Voices of the Exiled'' (Doubleday 1994); the novel into which it was incorporated, ''Out West'', appeared in 1996.

[[Stephen Bly]]’s Wild West novel ''Dangerous Ride Across Humboldt Flats'' (Crossway Press, 2003) deals with the area before the town was built. In the opening chapters, an orphaned [[Pony Express]] rider comes across Trent Lovelock and his family on Humboldt Flats in 1860 and is befriended by them.&lt;ref&gt;The first two chapters are currently available [http://www.gnpcb.org/assets/products/excerpts/1581344724.1.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt; Although George Lovelock had yet to set out for Nevada at that time, the author has acknowledged that he had the town's founder in mind in his fictitious Trent Lovelock.&lt;ref&gt;Yann Lovelock, “Lovelock Avatars”, ''Lovelock Lines'' 6, December 2007 [http://lovelock.free.fr/l-lines/lovelock-lines-6th-ed.pdf p.7]&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, Lovelock has a poet of its own in [[Adrian C. Louis]], who was brought up on the small reservation for [[Lovelock Paiute Tribe of the Lovelock Indian Colony|Lovelock Paiute Indians]] south of the town. The presence of the Indian Cemetery there is an abiding point of reference for him and a place to which he often returns, in person and more often, in memory.
:::I'm at that place I grew up to leave.
:::Alkali-crusted sand waves have drifted against my markers of blood.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Indian Cemetery: Lovelock, Nevada&quot;, ''Fire Water World'', Albuquerque NM, 1989 (ISBN 0931122511 / 0-931122-51-1)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sparks''' is a [[city]] in [[Washoe County, Nevada|Washoe County]], [[Nevada]], [[United States]]. It was established in 1905 and is located just east of [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]]. The 2010 U.S. Census Bureau population count was 90,264.&lt;ref name=&quot;Census 2010&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml| title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (G001): Sparks city, Nevada| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau, American Factfinder| accessdate=January 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the fifth most populous city in Nevada. Sparks is often referred to as half of a [[Twin cities (geographical proximity)|twin city]] (i.e., &quot;[[Reno-Sparks]]&quot;).

==History==
In the early historical period, the area that is now Sparks was inhabited by the [[Washoe people]]. Euro-American settlement of the area began in the early 1850s, with the early settlers often selling [[cattle]] to [[California]]-bound emigrants. The emigrants' cattle were commonly weak and sick from the long and arduous journey along the [[California Trail]], and they needed fresh animals to take them over the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]]. As part of the deal, the settlers would receive the emigrants' cattle, and then fatten them up to sell to the next year's batch of emigrants.{{cn|date = October 2013}}

The [[population density]] in the area remained very low until 1904 when the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] built a [[rail yard|switch yard]] and maintenance sheds there. The city that sprung up around them was first called '''Harriman''' after [[E. H. Harriman]], president of the Southern Pacific. The city was quickly renamed '''Sparks''' after [[John Sparks (Nevada politician)|John Sparks]], the governor of Nevada at that time.{{cn|date = October 2013}}

Sparks remained a small and sleepy town until the 1950s, when economic growth in Reno triggered a housing boom north of the railroad in the area of Sparks. During the 1970s, the area south of the railroad started to fill up with warehouses and light industry. In 1984 the tower for [[John Ascuaga's Nugget Casino Resort]] was finished, giving Sparks its first, and currently only, high-rise [[casino]]. In 1996, the redevelopment effort of the old and unsightly&lt;!--POV?--&gt; B Street business district across from the Nugget that started in the early 1980s took a step forward with the opening of a multi-screen movie complex and the construction of a plaza area. This area, now known as Victorian Square, is a pedestrian-friendly district that hosts many open-air events.{{cn|date = October 2013}}

Under direction of the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]], a comprehensive dynamic water quality [[computer model]], the [[DSSAM Model]], was developed (Earth Metrics, 1987) to analyze impacts of a variety of land use and [[stormwater]] management decisions throughout the {{convert|3120|sqmi|adj=on}} [[Truckee River]] basin; this model was used to develop a set of [[surface runoff]] [[stormwater]] management measures for Sparks in the 1980s.{{cn|date = October 2013}}

On 21 October 2013, Sparks Middle School in Sparks was the scene of a [[Sparks Middle School shooting|school shooting]]. A 12-year-old student, who was armed with a [[handgun]] opened fire at the school that morning before classes began, killing one mathematics teacher and apparently also himself. Two others were wounded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ca.news.yahoo.com/shooter-opens-fire-nevada-middle-school-154307896.html?vp=1 October 2013 school shooting]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Winnemucca''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=EN-US-Winnemucca.ogg|ˌ|w|ɪ|n|ə|ˈ|m|ʌ|k|ə}}) is a city in and the [[county seat]] of [[Humboldt County, Nevada]], United States.{{GR|6|dateform=mdy}}  As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the city had a total population of 7,396,&lt;ref name=&quot;Census 2010&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_DP/G001/1600000US3284800| title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (G001): Winnemucca city, Nevada| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau, American Factfinder| accessdate=January 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; up 3.1 percent from the 2000 census figure of 7,174. [[Interstate 80 in Nevada|Interstate 80]] passes through the city, where it meets [[U.S. Route 95 in Nevada|U.S. Route 95]].

== History and culture ==
The town received its name from a local Indian chief of the same name, which is loosely translated as &quot;One Moccasin.&quot;  His daughter Sarah Winnemucca was an advocate for education and fair treatment of the Paiute and Shoshone tribes in the area. 
On September 16, 1868, the [[Central Pacific Railroad]] reached Winnemucca, and was officially opened on October 1 of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Marden|first=J. P.|title=The History of Winnemucca|publisher=Central Pacific Railroad Photographic History Museum|year=2005|url=http://cprr.org/Museum/Winnemucca_Marden.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=April 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 19, 1900, [[Butch Cassidy|Butch Cassidy's]] gang robbed the First National Bank of Winnemucca of $32,640.

Winnemucca is featured prominently in the novel ''Revoltingly Young'' by [[C.D. Payne]], and is also a setting in ''[[More Tales of the City (novel)|More Tales of the City]]'' by [[Armistead Maupin]]. The city is also referenced in the North American version of the (originally Australian) song [[I've Been Everywhere|&quot;I've Been Everywhere.&quot;]] The song begins, &quot;I was totin' my pack along the dusty Winnemucca road.&quot;

Winnemucca's [[Prostitution   in Nevada|brothel district]], while smaller now than in the 1980s, is known as &quot;The Line&quot; or &quot;The Ring Circle&quot; based on the layout of the street where the brothels are located, and sex workers in the town must register their vehicles with the local police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Giang|first=Vivian| title=Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Prostitution In Nevada|work=Business Insider|date=December 14, 2011|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/prostitution-legal-nevada-prostitutes-brothels-sex-2011-12?op=1|accessdate=April 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a billboard spotted along [[Nevada State Route 140|State Route 140]] (the &quot;Winnemucca to the Sea Highway&quot;), Winnemucca styles itself &quot;The City of Paved Streets&quot;.

Winnemucca is home to the Buckaroo Hall of Fame and Heritage Museum. It is also the headquarters of the Flawedcast Network.

==Chinatown==
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Winnemucca was the location of a vibrant Chinatown.  The Chinese originally came to the area working on the transcontinental [[Central Pacific Railroad]], which reached Winnemucca in 1868. Some remained or returned to settle. Around 400 Chinese formed a community in the town during the 1890s. Among the prominent buildings was the Joss House on Baud Street, a place of worship and celebration that was visited by [[Sun Yat-Sen]], later to become Chinese president, in 1911 on a revolutionary fund raising tour of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Chew, James R. &quot;Boyhood Days in Winnemucca, 1901–1910.&quot; ''Nevada Historical Society Quarterly'' 1998 41(3): 206–209. ISSN 0047-9462&lt;/ref&gt; The Joss House, the last remains of Chinatown, was demolished on March 8, 1955, by Winnemucca City Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Humboldt Pioneers effort to save famed Joss House rebuffed by City Council | date = 7 Jan 1955 | url = http://newspaperarchive.com/reno-evening-gazette/1955-01-07/page-8 | work = Reno Evening Gazette | page = 8 | accessdate = June 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Stanley | last = Miller | title = Baud Street Winnemucca | date = Sept 1963 | url = http://mydesertmagazine.com/files/196309-DesertMagazine-1963-September.pdf | work = Desert Magazine | page = 23 | accessdate = June 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:FallonNV8104.JPG|thumb|250px|Corn Field in Fallon, Nevada, August 2004.]]
'''Fallon''' is a city in [[Churchill County, Nevada|Churchill County]], [[Nevada]], [[United States]], in the western part of the state. The population was 8,600 at time of the [[United States Census, 2010|2010 census]]. Fallon is the [[county seat]] of Churchill County,{{GR|6}} and is located in the [[Lahontan Valley]].

Fallon and Churchill County are mostly agricultural areas. Although the area is arid, approximately {{convert|50,000|acre|km2}} of its pastureland are irrigated with water from the [[Truckee–Carson Irrigation District]]. The principal crop grown is alfalfa for livestock feed. The &quot;Heart O' Gold&quot; cantaloupes of Churchill County were once distributed across the U.S.A., but are now grown mostly for consumption in Nevada.

The largest single employer in Fallon and Churchill County is the important [[Naval Air Station Fallon]], a training [[airfield]] that has been the home of the [[U.S. Navy]]'s Naval Strike and Air Warfare Center including the TOPGUN training program since 1996, when it was moved here from [[Naval Air Station Miramar]] with that Air Station transferred to the [[U.S. Marine Corps]].

[[U.S. Route 50 in Nevada|U.S. Highway 50]] (US&amp;nbsp;50, east–west) is one of the two [[highway]]s that intersect through the city. The other one is [[U.S. Route 95 in Nevada|US&amp;nbsp;95]] (north–south), so Fallon is at the crossroads of an important pair of [[U.S. Numbered Highways]]. Fallon is one of the towns on the so-called &quot;Loneliest Highway in America&quot;, the stretch of US&amp;nbsp;50 across most of Nevada that is known for its remoteness. Eastbound travelers from Fallon must drive {{convert|110|mi}} to find the next town, [[Austin, Nevada|Austin]].

==Geography==
Fallon is located at the [[geographic coordinates]] {{Coord|39|28|22|N|118|46|44|W|type:city}} (39.472792, -118.778826).{{GR|1}}

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], this city has a total area of {{convert|3.1|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|3.0|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|0.04|sqmi|km2}} (0.65%) is water.

==Climate==
Fallon experiences a desert climate, with hot summers and cold winters. Due to Fallon's altitude and aridity, the [[Diurnal temperature variation]] is quite substantial, especially in the summer months. Fallon's climate is quite dry, due to its location in the [[Rain Shadow|rain shadow]] of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]]. Summer days can be hot, but temperatures are cooler than in deserts such as the [[Mojave Desert|Mojave]], [[Sonoran Desert|Sonoran]], and [[Chihuahuan Desert]], due to Fallon's altitude and higher [[latitude]] north of the equator. In the winter, daytime temperatures are usually above freezing, but nights can be bitterly cold. Fallon can experience heavy fog in winter, known as [[Ice fog|pogonip]].

About 9.5% of families and 12.6% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 15.6% of those under age 18 and 10.3% of those age 65 or over.

==Politics==
The [[Paiute-Shoshone Tribe of the Fallon Reservation and Colony]] is headquartered in Fallon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://500nations.com/Nevada_Tribes.asp &quot;Nevada Tribes.&quot;] ''500 Nations.'' 2009 (retrieved 8 December 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] [[Martin Heinrich]] was born in Fallon.

==Nuclear weapons testing==
Los Alamos National Laboratory, in conjunction with the Department of Defense, conducted an underground nuclear test 28 miles southeast of Fallon, at 5 p.m. on October 26, 1963.

Named ''[[Project Shoal]]'', the 12.5 kiloton detonation was part of the [[Vela Uniform]] program. The device exploded at a depth of 1,205 feet below ground surface.&lt;ref name=&quot;ndep.nv.gov&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Remediation Project Shoal Area, Nevada Division of Environmental Protection | url = http://ndep.nv.gov/shoal/SHOAL1.HTM}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site is located in Gote Flat in the [[Sand Springs Range]].

Access to the Project Shoal Area is unrestricted.&lt;ref name=&quot;ndep.nv.gov&quot;/&gt; Access to the area is by Highway 50, Nevada Highway 839, then to an improved gravel road to the site.

==Grimes Point==
[[Image:GrimesPointNV.JPG|thumb|250x|[[Petroglyph]] at Grimes Point]]
Seven miles east of Fallon, adjacent to Highway 50, is the Grimes Point Petroglyph Trail.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nv.blm.gov/carson/Recreation/Rec_grimes_pt.htm nv.blm.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Trail features rocks with carvings as much as eight thousand years old, created by native peoples who were drawn to the shores of ancient [[Lake Lahontan]].  The Trail is approximately one-half mile long on a level path.  Free brochures explaining the native art are available. There is also a cave where bats dwell. The path begins to rise as it goes from the now level lake bottom to the once higher bank where inhabited with caves.

The Grimes Point site is a part of a much larger archaeological complex, which includes a wide variety of materials, caves, shelters, and other archaeological sites. The site is located on what was once a shoreline of Pleistocene Lake Lahontan and is best known for the cupules, which are small pits dug out of the rock surface and found on hundreds of boulders in the area.

This site was the primary locality used by archaeologists Robert Heizer and Martin Baumhoff to define the “Pit and Groove Style” of rock art, which is thought by many to be the oldest type of rock art found in Nevada. It does share certain characteristics with other Great Basin rock art known to be of great antiquity called Great Basin Carved Abstract. Specifically, the depth of engraving and the width of the engraved lines are much greater than other rock art types that appear to be of more recent manufacture, a characteristic also noted elsewhere.

Archaeologist Karen Nissen included Grimes Point in her analyses of rock art sites in western Nevada and concluded that rock art was generally associated with hunting locales, an idea popular at that time but somewhat less so today.

Grimes had been very badly abused prior to its listing in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1972, though the Bureau of Land Management began restoration and development for public exploration by the late 1970s and 1980s. The site is located off U.S. 50 east of Fallon and open to the public year-round.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grimes Point&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Woody|first=Alanah|title=Grimes Point|url=http://www.onlinenevada.org/Grimes_Point|publisher=Online Nevada Encyclopedia|accessdate=16 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
* According to the ''[[Home Improvement (TV series)|Home Improvement]]'' episode &quot;A Sew Sew Evening&quot;, Al was stationed in Fallon when he served in the Navy, which was a disappointment to him since he wanted to see the world.  Interestingly, he used the native pronunciation of &quot;Nevada,&quot; which is unusual for an outsider, especially someone in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]].

* Films such as ''[[Top Gun]]'' and ''[[Kerosene Cowboys]]'' have been shot there and at [[Naval Air Station Fallon]].

* ''[[The Wizard (film)|The Wizard]]'', starring [[Fred Savage]] and [[Beau Bridges]], was shot in and around Fallon as well.

* ''[[The Go-Getter (film)|The Go-Getter]]'', starring [[Zooey Deschanel]] and [[Jena Malone]], mentions Fallon many times and even brings up Fallon's annual Heart 'O Gold Cantaloupe Festival. Malone's character lives in Fallon and parts of the movie were filmed in and around Fallon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0479289/ imdb.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Harvey Dahl]], a Fallon native and [[St. Louis Rams]] offensive lineman, swore aloud into a referees microphone after a holding penalty against him in Week 15 in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://deadspin.com/5869146/st-louis-lineman-called-for-holding-yells-thats-not-fucking-holding-into-refs-open-mic-and-then-it-got-weird&lt;/ref&gt;

Dayley, ''Shoshoni Texts'' (1997, Boise State University), pg. 167&lt;/ref&gt; is a city in [[Elko County, Nevada|Elko County]], [[Nevada]], [[United States]]. The population was 18,297 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. It is the [[county seat]] of [[Elko County, Nevada|Elko County]].{{GR|6}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Profile for Elko, Nevada, NV&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epodunk.com/cgi-bin/genInfo.php?locIndex=17670|title=Profile for Elko, Nevada, NV|publisher=ePodunk|accessdate=September 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city straddles the [[Humboldt River]].

Elko is the principal city of the [[Elko micropolitan area|Elko Micropolitan Statistical Area]], a [[United States micropolitan area|micropolitan area]] that covers Elko and [[Eureka County, Nevada|Eureka]] counties&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.census.gov/population/www/estimates/metro_general/2006/List5.txt MICROPOLITAN STATISTICAL AREAS AND COMPONENTS]{{dead link|date=September 2013}}, [[Office of Management and Budget]], 2007-05-11.

It is home to [[Great Basin College]], as well as to the [[National Weather Service]] Weather Forecast Office serving most of northern and central Nevada.

==History==
Though Elko lies along the route of the historic [[California Trail]], it was first inhabited only in 1868, when it was at the east end of the railroad tracks built by [[Central Pacific Railroad]] (the portion of the [[First transcontinental railroad (North America)|First Transcontinental Railroad]] built from California to Utah). When the railroad crews moved on, Elko remained, serving as a center for ranching, mining, rail freight and general supplies.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hickson|first=Howard|year=1983|month=Fall|title=Elko, Nevada: 1868-1968|journal=Northeastern Nevada Historical Society Quarterly|volume=83|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elko is said to have been named by [[Charles Crocker]], a superintendent of the [[Central Pacific Railroad]]. He was especially fond of animal names and added the letter &quot;o&quot; to Elk. There is no definitive evidence of this naming history, but it has become the widely accepted version.&lt;ref name=&quot;Profile for Elko, Nevada, NV&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt;

The first [[Elko County Courthouse]] was built in 1869. Elko was officially incorporated as a city in 1917.

In 1925, the Kelly Act (also known as the Airmail Act of 1925) authorized the [[United States Postal Service|U.S. Post Office]] to contract with private airlines for the feeder routes that fed the main transcontinental route. The first commercial airmail flight in the United States was on the 487 mile Airmail Route #5 from [[Pasco, Washington]] to what would become [[Elko Regional Airport]] on April 6, 1926. The flight was piloted by Leon D. Cuddeback and included a brief stop in [[Boise, Idaho]] to pick up more mail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hickson|first=Howard|year=1970|month=Fall|title=Dirt Runways: Elko Airport - The Early Years (1919-1926)|journal=Northeastern Nevada Historical Society Quarterly|volume=1|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1910 replacement for the [[Elko County Courthouse|original courthouse]] is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. The U.S. Post Office-Elko Main, built in 1933, is also listed.

==Economy==
[[File:View southwest along the Humboldt River from the 9th Street Footbridge in downtown Elko, Nevada.JPG|thumb|right|View southwest along the Humboldt River from the 9th Street Footbridge in downtown Elko, Nevada]]
Elko's economy is based on [[Gold mining in Nevada|gold mining]], ranching, and tourism. As of early 2009, [[Elko County, Nevada|Elko County]] had 26,700 jobs, up from 25,500 in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Carlton|first=Jim|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123923354485803067.html|title=Gold-Plated Economy in Nevada Town Becomes Rare Beacon for the Jobless - WSJ.com|work=online.wsj.com|accessdate=June 6, 2010|date=April 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elko is considered the capital of Nevada's goldbelt. The state of Nevada produces more gold than all but four countries, most of which is mined near Elko. This has caused the town to have a boom and bust economy consistent with the rises and declines in the price of gold. The town is surrounded by hundreds of abandoned mining camps, and viewing them is a popular local activity. A gold boom in the 1980s that ended in a bust in the late 1990s left the town with large numbers of abandoned homes and left the local governments struggling to survive on reduced tax revenues. With a new gold boom starting in 2009, city officials have been reluctant to hire new employees and have decided to build a reserve in the city budget to prepare for the next bust.&lt;ref name=Powers&gt;{{cite news |title=Elko, Nev., takes the gold boom with a grain of doubt |author=Ashley Powers |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=September 20, 2011 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/sep/20/nation/la-na-nevada-gold-20110921 |accessdate=September 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elko has struggled to bring in other industries, mostly because of its isolation, and the surrounding harsh desert environment. [[Hunter S. Thompson]] quipped that in Elko, &quot;The federal government owns 90% of this land, and most of it is useless for anything except weapons testing and poison-gas experiments&quot;.&lt;ref name=Powers/&gt;

==Arts and culture==
===Annual cultural events===
Elko is also the home of the annual [[National Cowboy Poetry Gathering]], and has been for the last 27 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.westernfolklife.org/site1/index.php/25th-Gathering.html|title=Western Folklife Center - National Cowboy Poetry Gathering Home Page|work=westernfolklife.org|accessdate=June 6, 2010}}{{dead link|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This festival is held each January and is a week-long celebration of life in the rural West, features poetry, music, stories, gear, film, photography, and food.

Every July, since 1963, Elko is host to the National [[Basque people|Basque]] Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.elkocva.com/basquefestival.shtml|title=Elko Convention and Visitors Authority, Elko Nevada|work=elkocva.com|accessdate=June 6, 2010}}{{dead link|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2013 they will be celebrating their 50th Anniversary. Humorously referred to as the &quot;Basquo Fiasco,&quot; it is a celebration of traditional Basque culture and its ties to the Elko community.  The festival includes strongman competitions, handball, a running of the bulls, traditional food and wine, and Basque Dancing.

The annual Elko Motorcycle Jamboree, also known as the &quot;Rumble in the Rubies Motorcycle Rally&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elkomotorcyclejamboree.com/|title=Elko Motorcycle Jamboree - Rumble in the Rubies|work=elkomotorcyclejamboree.com|accessdate=June 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; is usually held in June.

The Western Folklife Center is located Downtown in the old Pioneer hotel.

Elko is home to a number of casinos, including Stockmen's Casino &amp; Hotel, the Commercial Casino, the High Desert Casino, Gold Dust West, the Red Lion Casino, and the Gold County Inn &amp; Casino. The Commercial Casino is notable for having a stuffed {{convert|10|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} polar bear on display. For many years the Red Lion brought gamblers to Elko from many parts of the country through flights on Casino Express. The flights to Elko ended in February 2006.

Elko is also home to [[Prostitution and the law#Regulated prostitution|legal prostitutes]] and contains active [[brothels]]. Under [[Nevada]] law, any county with a population of less than 400,000 is allowed to license brothels if it so chooses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leg.state.nv.us/NRS/NRS-244.html#NRS244Sec345|title=NRS: CHAPTER 244 - COUNTIES: GOVERNMENT|work=leg.state.nv.us|accessdate=June 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elko is the largest city between [[Salt Lake City]] and [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]] located along [[Interstate 80]].  Passenger service to Elko is available on [[Greyhound Lines]], while [[Amtrak]]'s twice-daily ''[[California Zephyr]]'' serves [[Elko_(Amtrak_station)|Elko Train Station]] and [[SkyWest Airlines]] serves [[Elko Regional Airport]] from Salt Lake City operating as the [[Delta Connection]].

Historically, Elko was the home base of a jet air carrier, [[Casino Express Airlines]], which operated [[Boeing 737-200]] jetliners to many cities in the U.S. on a scheduled charter basis in support of the local casino industry.  Casino Express changed its name to [[Xtra Airways]] and relocated its headquarters to Boise, Idaho.

Elko also was previously served by [[United Airlines]] with scheduled passenger jet service during the 1970s and early 1980s.  According to [[Official Airline Guide]] ([[OAG]]] flight schedules as well as the airline's system timetables, United operated [[Boeing 737-200]] jetliners into the [[Elko Regional Airport]] on a year-round basis with a daily roundtrip routing of San Francisco (SFO)-Reno (RNO)-Elko (EKO)-Ely (ELY)-Salt Lake City (SLC).  United eventually discontinued all service to Elko.

==History==
Caliente was founded in 1901 on '''Culverwell Ranch''' (or just '''Culverwell'''), built on land owned by William and Charles Culverwell. The town was initially given the name of '''Calientes''', due to the hot springs present in the area, but later in the year a post office was erected and workers removed the &quot;s&quot; from the name of the town. In 1905, the Union Pacific railroad was completed, followed by the construction of the train depot in the style of Spanish mission architecture. The train depot, built in 1923, is now home to some city and county offices and a museum that exhibits historical information.

'''West Wendover''' is a city in [[Elko County, Nevada|Elko County]], [[Nevada]], [[United States]]. The population was 4,410 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. It is part of the [[Elko, Nevada|Elko]] [[Elko, Nevada micropolitan area|micropolitan area]]. West Wendover is located on the eastern border of Nevada and the western edge of the [[Great Salt Lake Desert]] and is contiguous with [[Wendover, Utah|Wendover]], [[Utah]], which it is sometimes confusing. [[Interstate 80 in Nevada|Interstate 80]] runs just north of the cities, while [[Interstate 80 Business (West Wendover, Nevada–Wendover, Utah)|Interstate 80 Business]] (Wendover Boulevard) runs through the two cities.

==History==
[[File:USAAF Monument in West Wendover, Nevada.jpg|thumb|left|USAAF Monument in West Wendover]]
West Wendover began to develop in the 1930s and 1940s with the introduction of legalized gambling in the State of Nevada. William &quot;Bill&quot; Smith founded a small cobblestone service station that provided a needed rest to weary travelers crossing the desert terrain of western Utah and eastern Nevada. Today this facility is known as the [[Wendover Nugget]]. It wasn't until December 2001, when the former State Line Casino and Hotel came under new ownership, did this long-standing organization lose its place as the oldest continually operated gaming license for a casino in the State of Nevada; over 66 years.

Through the 1970s and 1980s West Wendover began to emerge as a destination resort. Additional business arrived constructing more casinos, hotels and other service establishments as well as recreational venues such as the Toana Vista Golf Course. As growth continued to spiral up, the citizens of West Wendover, Nevada, then a township of Elko County, elected to incorporate under self-rule. On July 1, 1991, the city of West Wendover, Nevada came into existence. Amber S Holt named the city seal of West Wendover encouraging people to, &quot;Come Grow With Us.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=West Wendover: Visitor's Guide: Historical|date=December 30, 2012|url=http://www.westwendovercity.com/visguide/historical.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of its ties with Wendover, Utah and its economic ties with central Utah, the [[United States Department of Transportation|U.S. Department of Transportation]] moved West Wendover to the [[Time zone#UTC-7 (MST - Mountain Standard Time)|Mountain Time Zone]] in October 1999, while the rest of Nevada remains in the [[Time zone#UTC-8 (PST - Pacific Standard Time)|Pacific Time Zone]]. ([[Jackpot, Nevada|Jackpot]], [[Nevada]] in northern Elko county only observes Mountain Time on an unofficial basis.)

West Wendover has thrived under a lucrative [[gambling]] industry in Nevada, which has generated tax revenue for city services and better schools. Meanwhile, just footsteps away, Wendover, Utah has decayed with almost no business tax base. Residents in both cities have voted to annex Wendover into Nevada, saying they are one community that has been divided for too long. Some politicians in both the State of Utah and the State of Nevada have endorsed the idea.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} However, the politicians in Wendover, Utah placed a permanent halt to the annexation process through a vote on November 15, 2006. The motion made was to halt the annexation process. The vote was a tie with two Council Members voting to halt the process and two Council Members supporting the continuation of the process. The tie vote was broken up by a vote of Wendover, Utah Mayor Brett Shelton who voted to discontinue the annexation process. Previously, West Wendover had decided to halt any further work after Wendover, Utah indicated they were going to discuss and make a decision on proceeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=West Wendover puts off decision|agency=Associated Press|publisher=Deseret News|date=March 8, 2006|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4188/is_20060308/ai_n16165463}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Article Four of the United States Constitution|Article IV]], Section 3 of the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] requires that any change in state boundaries be approved by the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] as well as by the Nevada and Utah legislatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Article IV|url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleiv#section3|work=U.S. Constitution|publisher=Cornell University Legal Information Institute|accessdate=March 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:School House--Chamber of Commerce.jpg|thumb|right|Fernley schoolhouse]]
Fernley was established in 1904 developed as primarily an [[agricultural]] and [[ranching]] community in proximity to Reno. Early in its history Fernley established its first schoolhouse. The one-room schoolhouse is still in use today as the home of the Fernley [[Chamber of Commerce]].

Much of the farmland in the Fernley area was developed through the Newlands Irrigation Project, which was a result of the [[Newlands Reclamation Act]] of 1902. The project established an [[irrigation]] system that delivers water to an area stretching from [[Derby Dam]], along the [[Truckee River]], to the [[Lake Lahontan (reservoir)|Lahontan Reservoir]] near [[Fallon, Nevada]]. Construction and expansion of the system took place from the inception through the 1960s. Many of the concrete irrigation headgates, still in use today, are embossed with the CCC ([[Civilian Conservation Corps]]) stamp and date of construction. In addition to the irrigation system in the Fernley area, a drainage system was also constructed to carry away excess water and mineral salts from the farmlands. This system consists of channels ({{convert|5|to|15|ft}} deep) dug adjacent to fields; it eventually terminates in the [[sink (geography)|sink]] northeast of Fernley. The irrigation system is administered and maintained through the [[Truckee–Carson Irrigation District]].

Until 1904, there was no place named &quot;Fernley&quot; in the area. It was not until the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] realigned its route through northwestern Nevada that the Fernley siding was created. Fernley first shows up as a station stop, but with no other services, on Southern Pacific employee timetables beginning with the September 18, 1904, edition (SP Salt Lake Division ETT No. 2). By September 3, 1905, Fernley is listed with a day and night [[telegraph]] office and [[wye (rail)|wye]] facilities. The descendants of the telegrapher James A. Galbraith, who arrived with his family in 1906, still reside in the region. 

In the meantime, a community emerged and took the name Fernley. The general area was part of the fledgling Truckee-Carson Reclamation Project created by Congress in 1902 and later named the Canal District because of the newly created Truckee Canal connecting the Truckee River to the Lahontan Reservoir. Workers and settlers found their way to the western edge of the first federal reclamation project. On June 9, 1904, the Lyon County Commissioners created the Canal Township and appointed a [[constable]], Robert A. Benson, and a [[justice of the peace]], Edgar I. Parker, both men filing for homesteads in late 1903, according to records housed at the National Archives. In 1907 more settlers arrived and established homesteads. 

On April 21, 1908, the Fernley post office opened. A public school also began operating in the 1908-1909 school year. According to the 1910 U.S. Census, 159 people lived in the Fernley area. Many of the town's residents were active in the [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist Party]]; some were appointed postmaster, and others elected to the school board, the office of the Justice of the Peace, and the State Assembly. 

The Southern Pacific Railroad completed the Fernley &amp; Lassen Railway in 1914, and a suitable depot was constructed in Fernley. Residents welcomed the completion of the transcontinental [[Lincoln Highway|Lincoln/Victory Highways]] through town in the 1920s. 

The town grew slowly at first. In 1960, only 654 people were enumerated in the U.S. Census. However, the population more than doubled by 1970 with the construction of [[Interstate 80]] and the Nevada Cement Company opening its operation in 1963. By 1980, the population had more than doubled again. By 1990, the population reached 5,164, and in 2000 the census counted 8,543 residents. The population more than doubled yet another time over the next decade, reaching 19,368 by the 2010 census.

===Name origin===

{{Original research|date=March 2013}}
The origin of Fernley's name remains obscure and shrouded in mystery.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://nsla.nevadaculture.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=761&amp;Itemid=418 Link to Story]&lt;/ref&gt; The answer probably is somewhere in the voluminous records of the Southern Pacific Railroad. Over the years, there has been much conjecture on for whom or for what Fernley was named. 

A letter to the editor published in the Sept./Oct. 1990 issue of ''Nevada Magazine'' claimed that a physician of [[Welsh people|Welsh]] origin by the name of Fernley opened a [[coal mine]] in the area and supplied coal to the railroad. &quot;The coal mining operation gave its name to the town of 'Fernley',&quot; wrote Al Riggle on behalf of the 95-year-old Mrs. Nettie Fernley of [[Tombstone, Arizona]]. &quot;In the early '30s a nephew of the doctor, Tom Fernley, moved there and set up a casino in Fernley.&quot; 

Nothing can be found that verifies Mrs. Nettie Fernley's claim. No coal mines were known to operate near Fernley; there is no record of a Dr. Fernley living or practicing anywhere in Nevada; and a Tom Fernley cannot be found operating a [[casino]] in Fernley in the 1930s. 

On the other hand, the Fernley family name has its origin in [[Wales]] and [[England]]. The ancient English town of [[Hereford]], near Wales, was once known as Fernley. St. Ethelbert ([[Æthelberht of Kent]]), King of the [[East Angles]], following his murder was finally buried at the church in the Heath of Fern circa 794. Today, there are no other communities in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, or the United Kingdom by the name of Fernley, according to on-line place names databases. Fernley, Nevada County, California, no longer exists. 

The source for Fernley, Nevada's, name may never be discovered. It is highly probable that the naming of the siding was random and concocted like nearby sidings labeled Bango, Benin, Ditho, Dodon, and Parran.

===Recent history===
In 1965, the Nevada [[Cement]] Company&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nevadacement.com/ Untitled Document&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; started operation in a new plant built on the north side of the city between Fernley and [[Wadsworth, Nevada|Wadsworth]]. This was the first significant non-agricultural/ranching business to come to Fernley, aside from the railroad. Primary employment in Fernley began a steady transition to an industrial and commuter base continuing to the present time. Beginning in the 1970s, parts of the formerly agricultural and ranching-based lands were transitioning to [[housing subdivision]]s to support the growing population, much of which was spilling over from rapid growth in the Reno-Sparks area. Close proximity to Interstate 80 and abundant land for housing made Fernley an attractive alternative to the increasingly congested and expensive [[Truckee Meadows]] housing market. Beginning near the established parts of the town, growth moved to the Fremont Street area in the mid to late 1970s, nearer farming areas in the 1980s, and has continued along the Farm District Road areas to the present. Numerous subdivisions now exist along the Farm District Road, including an 18-hole golf course and a new elementary school.

In 1999, [[Amazon.com]] opened a {{convert|750000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} order fulfillment center in the industrial park located in the northeast side of the city, following major initiatives and investments by investors from [[Seattle]]. Stanley Works had previously used the facility; Amazon.com redesigned the interior systems and greatly expanded the capacity in the years since. The investment has provided thousands of new jobs for the city and invigorated the economy in the metropolitan area. Since that time, more companies have opened facilities in the park, including Trex Inc., Allied Signal, UPS Worldwide Logistics (Honeywell), ARE Campers, Johns Manville, and Sherwin Williams Paint.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityoffernley.org/ Fernley, NV - Official Website&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 1, 2001, the city of Fernley was incorporated.

Fernley is home to Fernley High School,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fhs.lyon.k12.nv.us/ Welcome to Fernley High School&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; the Vaqueros. The school is currently located off U.S. 95 on the south side of town. Prior to 1980, the high school was located at the current Fernley Intermediate School on Hardie Lane. Founded in late 1950s, the original high school was demolished in the early 1960s and was located on the block now occupied by the In-Town Park near the old downtown area between U.S. 95 and Center Street.

On January 5, 2008, a [[levee]] along the Truckee Canal broke, forcing the rescue and evacuation of 3,500 people from the town as {{convert|3|to|6|ft}} of water filled houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,320496,00.html | work=Fox News | title=Nevada Levee Breaks; 3,500 Being Rescued | date=2008-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kolotv.com/home/headlines/13286002.html Hundreds Of Homes Flooded By Ruptured Levee&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Carson City''', officially the '''Consolidated Municipality of Carson City''', is an [[Independent city (United States)|independent city]] and the capital of the state of [[Nevada]], named for the Mountain man [[Kit Carson]]. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the population was 55,274.&lt;ref name=&quot;QF&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=State &amp; County QuickFacts|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/32/32510.html|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=September 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the population of the town lives in [[Eagle Valley (Nevada)|Eagle Valley]], on the eastern edge of the [[Carson Range]], a branch of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]]. Carson City is about {{convert|30|mi|-1}} south of [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]] and originated as a stopover for California bound emigrants, but developed into a city with the [[Comstock Lode]], a silver strike in the mountains to the northeast. The city has served as the capital of Nevada since statehood in 1864 and for much of its history was a hub for the [[Virginia and Truckee Railroad]], although the tracks were removed in the 1950s. Prior to 1969, Carson City was also the [[county seat]] of [[Ormsby County, Nevada|Ormsby County]]. In 1969, the county was abolished and Carson City and a few small surrounding settlements within the former county were merged into a newly formed independent city called Carson City Consolidated Municipality.&lt;ref name=consolidatedmunicipality&gt;{{cite web

==History==
[[Image:Abraham Curry.png|thumb|125px|left|Abraham Curry]]
[[Image:Carson City, 1877.jpg|thumb|Illustration of Carson City in 1877]]
The first European Americans to arrive in what is known as Eagle Valley were [[John C. Fremont]] and his exploration party in January 1843.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/travel/nevada/carson.htm|title=National Park Service: Three Historic Cities|publisher=Travel Nevada.com|accessdate=6=2-2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fremont named the river flowing through the valley [[Carson River]] in honor of [[Kit Carson|Christopher &quot;Kit&quot; Carson]], the [[mountain man]] and scout he had hired for his expedition. Prior to the Fremont expedition, the [[Washoe people]] inhabited the valley and surrounding areas. Settlers named the area Washoe in reference to the tribe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bayer|first=C.W.|title=Profits, plots &amp; lynching; the creation of Nevada Territory|year=1995|publisher=Purple Mountain Press|location=Carson, City NV|isbn=0-9628890-3-2|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1851 the [[Eagle Station]] ranch located along the Carson River served as a trading post and stopover for travelers on the [[California Trail]]'s [[Carson Branch]] which ran through [[Eagle Valley (Nevada)|Eagle Valley]]. The valley and trading post received their name from a [[bald eagle]] that was hunted and killed by one of the early settlers and was featured on a wall inside the post.

As the area was part of the [[Utah Territory]], it was governed from Salt Lake City, where the territorial government was headquartered. Early settlers bristled at the control exterted by Mormon-influenced officials and desired the creation of the Nevada territory. A vigilante group of influential settlers, headed by Abraham Curry, sought a site for a capital city for the envisioned territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Oldham|first=Willa|title=Carson City: Nevada’s Capital City|year=1991|publisher=Nevada State Museum|location=Carson City, NV|asin=B0006QSL8Q|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1858, [[Abraham Curry]] bought Eagle Station and thereafter renamed the settlement Carson City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitcarsoncity.com/history/|title=Carson City Living History|author=Carson City website|accessdate=2013-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As Curry and several other partners had Eagle Valley surveyed for development. Curry had decided for himself that Carson City would someday serve as the capital city and left a {{convert|10|acre|m2|adj=on}} plot open in the center of town for a future capitol building.

Following the discovery of gold and silver in 1859 on the nearby [[Comstock Lode]], Carson City's population began to rise. Curry built the Warm Springs Hotel a mile to the east of the center of town. As predicted, Carson City was selected as the territorial capital, besting [[Virginia City, Nevada|Virginia City]] and American Flat. Curry loaned the Warm Springs Hotel to the territorial Legislature as a meeting hall. The Legislature named Carson City to be the seat of [[Ormsby County, Nevada|Ormsby County]] and selected the hotel as the territorial prison with Curry serving as its first warden. Today the property still serves as part of the state prison.

When Nevada became a state in 1864 during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Carson City was confirmed as Nevada's permanent capital. Carson City's development was no longer dependent on the mining industry and instead became a thriving commercial center. The [[Virginia &amp; Truckee Railroad]] was built between Virginia City and Carson City. A [[Log Flume|wooden flume]] was also built from the Sierra Nevadas into Carson City. The current capitol building was constructed from 1870 to 1871. The [[United States Mint]] operated a [[Carson City Mint|branch mint]] in Carson City between the years 1870 and 1893, which struck gold and silver coins. People came from China during that time, many of them to work on the railroad. Some of them owned businesses and taught school. By 1880, almost a thousand Chinese people, &quot;one for every five Caucasians,&quot; lived in Carson City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nevadaappeal.com/article/20030925/OPINION/309250201/|title=Dedicated to Carson's Chinese history|author=Kelli Du Fresne|publisher=Nevada Appeal|accessdate=September 7, 2011}}{{dead link|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carson City's population and transportation traffic decreased when the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] built a line through [[Donner Pass]], too far to the north to benefit Carson City. The city was slightly revitalized with the mining booms in [[Tonopah, Nevada|Tonopah]] and [[Goldfield, Nevada|Goldfield]]. The US federal building (now renamed the [[Paul Laxalt]] Building) was completed in 1890 as was the [[Stewart Indian School]]. Carson City resigned itself to small city status, advertising itself as &quot;America's smallest capital.&quot;

===20th-century revitalization and growth===
The city slowly grew; by 1960 it had reached its 1880, boom-time population. In 1969, Ormsby County was officially dissolved and Carson City took over all municipal services with an [[Independent city (United States)|independent city]] status. With this consolidation, Carson City absorbed former town sites such as [[Empire City, Nevada|Empire City]], which had grown up in the 1860s as a milling center along the Carson River and current [[US 50 (NV)|US 50]]. Carson City could now advertise itself as one of America's largest state capitals with its {{convert|146|sqmi|km2}} of city limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carson.org/Index.aspx?page=140|title=Carson City: History|author=Carson City Government|accessdate=February 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, the city adopted a downtown master plan, specifying that no building within {{convert|500|ft|m|abbr=off}} of the capitol would surpass it in height. This plan prohibited future high-rise development in the center of downtown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/ci/?id=carsoncity-nv-usa|title=About Carson City|author=Staff Writer|publisher=Emporis|accessdate=February 6, 2010}}{{dead link|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Ormsby House]] is currently the tallest building in downtown Carson City, at a height of 117 feet. The structure was completed in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emporis.com/city/carsoncity-nv-usa/all-buildings/highrise |title=Carson City High Rise Buildings |publisher=Emporis.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government and politics==
Carson City is governed via the mayor-council system. The mayor is elected in a citywide vote to a four-year term. The city council is called the Board of Supervisors and has four members. Members are elected from single member wards. Nevada's capital is generally considered a Republican stronghold, often voting for Republicans by wide margins. In 2004, George Bush defeated John Kerry 57-40%. In 2008 however [[Barack Obama]] became the first Democrat since 1964 to win Ormsby County/Carson City, defeating [[John McCain]] 49% to 48%, by 204 votes, a margin of under 1%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carson.org/Index.aspx?page=95|title=Carson City Politics|page=95|publisher=carson.org|accessdate=2013-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carson City, being the state capital, is home to many political protests and demonstrations at any given time. Weekly protests have included Save the Virginia Range Horses,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nevadaappeal.com/article/20120915/NEWS/120919867&amp;parentprofile=search|newspaper=Nevada Appeal}}{{dead link|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; End the Wars in Iraq and Afghanistan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/military/world-war-ii-korea-veterans-join-anti-war-protests-carson-city|title=World War II, Korea veterans join anti-war protests in Carson City |newspaper=Las Vegas Review Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occupy Carson City &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mynews4.com/news/story/Occupy-Carson-City-Protest-on-Saturday/Rv-wGfkCnESciPUXjq2H1A.cspx|newspaper=KRNV}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and Nevada ANTI-Corruption Movement that features a 150-foot-long by 4-foot-tall Crime Scene banner in front of the Nevada Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto and Governor Brian Sandoval offices,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nevadaappeal.com/article/20120429/NEWS/120429789&amp;parentprofile=search|newspaper=Nevada Appeal}}{{dead link|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the State Legislative buildings and the Carson City courthouse. Other large protests include the Tea Party protest in 2009 and AFSCME local 4041 protests related to State employee collective bargaining efforts and other issues. Perhaps the biggest protest second to the 2009 Tea Party protest was the 2009 demonstration against education budget cuts by Governor Brian Sandoval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/nevada-legislature/protesters-carson-city-objecting-education-cuts?c=n|newspaper=Las Vegas Review Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an attempt to either make proposed spent nuclear fuel storage facility at [[Yucca Mountain]] too expensive (by raising property tax rates to the maximum allowed) or to allow the state to collect the potential federal payments of property taxes on the facility, the State of Nevada in 1987 created a new county with no residents called [[Bullfrog County, Nevada|Bullfrog County]], carved Yucca Mountain out of [[Nye County, Nevada|Nye County]], and made Carson City the county seat of Bullfrog County, even though it is not located in Bullfrog County and is more than 100 miles from Yucca Mountain.  A state judge found the process unconstitutional, Yucca Mountain was absorbed back into Nye County, and Bullfrog County was dissolved in 1989.

==Climate==
Carson City features a [[semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''BSk'')&lt;ref&gt;[[Media:North-America Koppen Map.png|Updated North American Map of the Köppen climate classification system.]]&lt;/ref&gt; with cool but not inordinately cold winters and hot summers. The city is situated in a high desert river valley approximately {{convert|4802|ft|m}} above sea level. There are four fairly distinct seasons, all of which are relatively mild compared to many parts of the country and to what one may expect given its elevation. Winters see typically light to moderate snowfall, with a median of {{convert|8.9|in|cm|0}}.&lt;ref name = NCDC /&gt; Most precipitation occurs in winter and spring, with summer and fall being fairly dry, drier than neighboring California. There are 37 days of {{convert|90|°F|0}}+ highs annually,&lt;ref name = NCDC /&gt; with {{convert|100|°F|0}}+ temperatures occurring in some years.

The Carson River flows from Douglas County through the southwestern edge of Carson City.

==Transportation==
[[Image:US395SouthofCarsonCity.jpg|thumb|left|Looking south on [[U.S. Route 395 in Nevada|US 395]], just south of [[U.S. Route 50 in Nevada|US 50]] near Carson City]]
There are two highways in the city [[US Route 395]] and [[US Route 50 in Nevada|US Route 50]].&lt;ref name=cvb&gt;{{cite web|title=Getting here|url=http://www.visitcarsoncity.com/aboutus/gettinghere.php|work=Carson City Convention and Visitors Bureau|accessdate=August 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Carson City is home to one under-construction freeway [[Interstate 580 (Nevada)|Interstate 580]]. Phase 1 of the Carson City Freeway Project from US 395, just north of the city, to US 50 was completed in February 2006 and Phase 2A, extending from Rt. 50 to Fairview Drive, was officially opened on September 24, 2009. Phase 2B, Fairview Drive to Rt. 50, awaits funding &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccfreeway.com|title=Carson City Freeway|author=Staff Writer|publisher=Carson City Freeway}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, according to Director Martinovich at NDOT, completion is anticipated for the fall of 2017&lt;ref&gt;Meeting w/Dir. Martinovich, 1:30pm on 4/19/12 at her NDOT office with Steve Waclo, Carson City.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to 2012, Carson City was one of only five state capitals not directly served by an Interstate highway; the city lost this distinction when I-580 was extended into the city limits.

Carson City's first modern bus system, Jump Around Carson, or JAC, opened to the public. JAC uses a smaller urban bus that is ideal for Carson City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carson.org/Index.aspx?page=1436|title=Jump Around Carson|author=Staff Writer|publisher=Jump Around Carson|accessdate=2013-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is virtually no ground public transportation to other destinations. Passenger trains haven't served Carson City since 1950, when the [[Virginia and Truckee Railroad]] was shut down. [[Greyhound Lines]] stopped their bus services to the town in 2006 and [[Amtrak]] discontinued their connecting thruway bus to [[Sacramento]] in 2008. There is now only a limited Monday – Friday RTC bus service&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rtcwashoe.com/Schedules/BusBook/INTERCITY.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Reno]] which is still served by both [[Greyhound]] and [[Amtrak]].

Carson City is also served by the [[Carson Airport]], which is a regional airport in the northern part of the city. [[Reno-Tahoe International Airport]], which is {{convert|28|mi|km}} away, handles domestic commercial flights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carsoncity-airport.com/Home.shtml|title=Carson City Airport|last=Staff Writer|publisher=Carson City Airport|accessdate=March 6, 2010}}{{dead link|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wells''' is a city in [[Elko County, Nevada|Elko County]], in northeast [[Nevada]] in the western [[United States]]. The population was 1,292 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. Wells is located at the junction of [[Interstate 80 in Nevada|Interstate 80]] and [[U.S. Route 93 in Nevada|U.S. Route 93]], approximately {{convert|50|mi|km}} east of [[Elko, Nevada|Elko]] and is part of the Elko [[Elko, Nevada micropolitan area|micropolitan area]].

==History==
The site of Wells began as a place called '''Humboldt Wells''' along the trail to California. It was subsequently founded as a railroad town along the original [[Transcontinental Railroad]], and was once a stopover for passenger trains. The [[Humboldt River]] has its source in springs and a swampy area just west of the city that today is called Humboldt Wells. In the late 19th century, Humboldt Wells was burning down, and in a frantic plea for help, a telegraph was sent that said, &quot;Wells is burning&quot;. After this the town was rebuilt and simply referred to as 'Wells'.

The Lone Star Motel located in Wells was used in the 2001 film ''[[Joy Ride (2001 film)|Joy Ride]]'' for a critical scene.

A [[Independence Valley fault system|magnitude 6.0 earthquake]] occurred near Wells at 6:16 A.M. on February 21, 2008. Because of its proximity of the [[epicenter]], Wells experienced significant damage. The earthquake originated 9&amp;nbsp;km below the surface, with its epicenter only {{convert|12|mi|km}} distant from Wells, at 41.077, 114.752.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eqinthenews/2008/us2008nsa9/|title=Wells Quake - USGS |publisher=Earthquake.usgs.gov|date=|accessdate=September 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This made Ely a mining town, suffering through the boom-and-bust cycles so common in the West. Originally, Ely was home to a number of copper mining companies, Kennecott being the most famous. With a crash in the copper market in the mid 1970s, Kennecott shut down and copper mining disappeared (temporarily).

With the advent of cyanide heap leaching—a method of extracting gold from what was previously considered very low-grade ore—the next boom was on. Many companies processed the massive piles of &quot;overburden&quot; that had been removed from copper mines, or expanded the existing open-pit mines to extract the gold ore. [[Gold]] mines as widespread as the Robinson project near [[Ruth, Nevada|Ruth]], and AmSelco's Alligator Ridge mine {{convert|65|mi|km}} from Ely, kept the town alive during the 1980s and 1990s, until the recent revival of copper mining.

As Kennecott's smelter was demolished, copper concentrate from the mine is now shipped by rail to [[Seattle]], where it is transported to [[Japan]] for smelting. The dramatic increase in demand for copper in 2005 has once again made Ely a copper boom town.

The now defunct [[BHP Nevada Railroad]] ran from the mining district south of Ruth through Ely to the junction with the Union Pacific at Shafter from 1996–99.

'''Reno''' is a city in the [[US]] state of [[Nevada]]. The city is situated in the northwestern part of the state and is the [[county seat]] of [[Washoe County, Nevada|Washoe County]]. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the city had a population of 225,221 making it the fourth most populous city in the state after [[Las Vegas]], [[Henderson, Nevada|Henderson]], and [[North Las Vegas, Nevada|North Las Vegas]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Census 2010&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml| title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (G001): Reno city, Nevada| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau, American Factfinder| accessdate=January 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reno is the most populous Nevada city outside of the [[Las Vegas metropolitan area]]. The city sits in a high desert valley at the foot of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]].

Known as &quot;The Biggest Little City in the World&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reno.gov/ |title=City of Reno : Home |publisher=Reno.gov |accessdate=2013-01-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reno is famous for its [[casino]]s and is the birthplace of [[Caesars Entertainment Corporation]]. In the 1980s, [[Indian gaming]] rules were relaxed, and starting in 2000 Californian Native casinos began to chip away at Reno's casino industry. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/15/us/with-gambling-in-decline-reno-struggles-to-reinvent-itself.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Reno–Sparks metropolitan area]] is informally called the [[Truckee Meadows]] and consists of nearly 500,000 residents.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reno CSA&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml| title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (DP-1): Reno-Sparks-Fernley, NV CSA| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau, American Factfinder| accessdate=January 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{See also|National Register of Historic Places listings in Nevada#Washoe County|l1=List of Registered Historic Places in Washoe County, Nevada|Timeline of Reno, Nevada history}}
Archaeological finds place the eastern border for the prehistoric [[Martis people]] in the Reno area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sagehen.ucnrs.org/CSFRS/petros.htm |title=North Fork petroglyphs |accessdate=August 15, 2008 |last=Brauman |first=Sharon K. |date=October 6, 2004 |publisher=ucnrs.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as the 1850s a few pioneers settled in the Truckee Meadows, a relatively fertile valley through which the [[Truckee River]] made its way from [[Lake Tahoe]] to [[Pyramid Lake (Nevada)|Pyramid Lake]]. In addition to [[subsistence farming]], these early residents could pick up business from travelers along the [[California Trail]], which followed the Truckee westward, before branching off towards [[Donner Lake]], where the formidable obstacle of the Sierra Nevada began.

[[Gold]] was discovered in the vicinity of [[Virginia City, Nevada|Virginia City]] in 1850, and a modest mining community developed, but the discovery of [[silver]] in 1859 at the [[Comstock Lode]] led to a [[silver rush|mining rush]].

To provide the necessary connection between Virginia City and the California Trail, Charles W. Fuller built a log toll bridge across the Truckee River in 1859. A small community that would service travelers soon grew up near the bridge. After two years, Fuller sold the bridge to [[Myron C. Lake]], who continued to develop the community with the addition of a grist mill, kiln, and livery stable to the hotel and eating house. He renamed it &quot;Lake's Crossing&quot;. In 1864, [[Washoe County, Nevada|Washoe County]] was consolidated with [[Roop County, Nevada|Roop County]], and Lake's Crossing became the largest town in the county. Lake had earned himself the title &quot;founder of Reno&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Guy Louis Rocha, &quot;Reno's First Robber Baron,&quot; ''Nevada Magazine'' 40,2(March–April 1980), p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

By January 1863, the [[Central Pacific Railroad]] (CPRR) had begun laying tracks east from [[Sacramento, California]], eventually connecting with the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] at [[Promontory, Utah]], to form the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]]. Lake deeded land to the CPRR in exchange for its promise to build a depot at Lake's Crossing. Once the railroad station was established, the town of Reno officially came into being on May 9, 1868.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} CPRR construction superintendent [[Charles Crocker]] named the community after Major General [[Jesse L. Reno|Jesse Lee Reno]], a Union officer killed in the [[American Civil War]] at the [[Battle of South Mountain]].

In 1871, Reno became the county seat of the newly expanded [[Washoe County, Nevada|Washoe County]], replacing the previous county seat, located in [[Washoe City, Nevada|Washoe City]]. However, political power in Nevada remained with the mining communities, first [[Virginia City, Nevada|Virginia City]] and later [[Tonopah, Nevada|Tonopah]] and [[Goldfield, Nevada|Goldfield]].{{cn|date = August 2013}}

The extension of the [[Virginia and Truckee Railroad]] to Reno in 1872 provided a boost to the new city's economy.  In the following decades, Reno continued to grow and prosper as a business and agricultural center and became the principal settlement on the transcontinental railroad between Sacramento and [[Salt Lake City]].{{cn|date = August 2013}}

As the mining boom waned early in the 20th century, Nevada's centers of political and business activity shifted to the non-mining communities, especially Reno and [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], and today the former mining metropolises stand as little more than ghost towns. Despite this, Nevada is still the third-largest gold producer in the world, after [[South Africa]] and [[Australia]]; the state yielded 6.9 percent of the world's supply in 2005 world gold production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John_O'Neill_100001295309124 |url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/gold-hits-record-high |title=ReviewJournal.com – News – Gold hits record high |publisher=Lvrj.com |date=January 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The &quot;[[Reno Arch]]&quot; was erected on Virginia Street in 1926 to promote the upcoming Transcontinental Highways Exposition of 1927. The arch included the words &quot;Nevada's Transcontinental Highways Exposition&quot; and the dates of the exposition. After the exposition, the Reno City Council decided to keep the arch as a permanent downtown gateway, and Mayor E.E. Roberts asked the citizens of Reno to suggest a slogan for the arch. No acceptable slogan was received until a $100 prize was offered, and G.A. Burns of Sacramento was declared the winner on March 14, 1929, with &quot;Reno, The Biggest Little City in the World&quot;.{{cn|date = August 2013}}

Reno took a leap when the state of Nevada legalized open-[[gambling]] in 1931, along with the passage of even more liberal [[divorce]] laws than places like [[Hot Springs, Arkansas]], offered. No other state offered what Nevada did in the 1930s, and [[casino]]s like the Bank Club and Palace were popular.{{cn|date = August 2013}}

Within a few years, the Bank Club, owned by [[George Wingfield]], Bill Graham, and Jim McKay, was the state's largest employer and the largest casino in the world. Wingfield owned most of the buildings in town that housed gaming and took a percentage of the profits, along with his rent.&lt;ref&gt;Moe, Al W. ''The Roots of Reno'', [http://www.amazon.com/Roots-Reno-Al-W-Moe/dp/143921199X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1322253439&amp;sr=1-1Booksurge], 2008, p.153&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ernie Pyle]] once wrote in one of his columns, &quot;All the people you saw on the streets in Reno were obviously there to get divorces.&quot; In [[Ayn Rand]]'s novel ''[[The Fountainhead]]'', published in 1943, the New York-based female protagonist tells a friend, &quot;I am going to Reno,&quot; which is taken as a different way of saying &quot;I am going to divorce my husband.&quot; Among others, the Belgian-French writer [[Georges Simenon]], at the time living in the U.S., came to Reno in 1950 in order to divorce his first wife.&lt;ref name=cultureamerica/&gt;

[[File:Downtown Reno 1955.ogv|thumb|left|Downtown Reno, 1955]]
The divorce business eventually died as the other states fell in line by passing their own laws easing the requirements for divorce, but gambling continued as a major Reno industry. While gaming pioneers like &quot;Pappy&quot; and Harold Smith of Harold's Club and Bill Harrah of the soon-to-dominate Harrah's casino set up shop in the 1930s, the war years of the 1940s cemented Reno as the place to play for two decades.&lt;ref&gt;Moe, Al W. ''Nevada's Golden Age of Gambling'', [http://www.amazon.com/Nevadas-Golden-Gambling-Revised-Expanded/dp/0971501904/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1322275959&amp;sr=1-1 Puget Sound Books], 2002, p.68&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 1950s, the need for economic diversification beyond gaming fueled a movement for more lenient business taxation.&lt;ref name=cultureamerica/&gt;

A disaster occurred on the afternoon of February 5, 1957, when an explosion ripped through the heart of downtown. At 1:03&amp;nbsp;pm, two explosions, caused by [[natural gas]] leaking into the maze of pipes and ditches under the city, and an ensuing fire destroyed five buildings in the vicinity of Sierra and First streets along the Truckee River. Forty-nine people were injured in the disaster, and two were killed. The first explosion hit under the block of shops on the west side of Sierra Street (now the site of the Century Riverside), the second, across Sierra Street, now the site of the Palladio.{{cn|date = August 2013}}

The presence of a main east-west rail line, the emerging interstate highway system, favorable state tax climate, and relatively inexpensive land created good conditions for warehousing and distribution of goods.{{cn|date = August 2013}}

Major new construction projects have been completed in the Reno and Sparks areas. A few new luxury communities were recently built in [[Truckee, California]], approximately {{convert|28|mi}} west of Reno on [[Interstate 80]]. Reno also is an outdoor recreation destination, due to its close proximity to the Sierra Nevada, [[Lake Tahoe]], and numerous [[ski resort]]s in the region.{{cn|date = August 2013}}

In more recent years, the city has gained some notoriety as the subject of the comedy series ''[[Reno 911!]]'' (which is not, however, filmed in the city).{{cn|date = August 2013}}

===Environmental factors===
&lt;!--40 miles outside of Reno, not appropriate for city article:[[File:Lakeviewlift.JPG|thumb|View of [[Lake Tahoe]] from a Diamond Peak ski lift]]--&gt;
[[Wetlands]] are an important part of the Reno/Tahoe area. They act as a natural filter for the solids that come out of the water treatment plant. Plant roots absorb nutrients from the water and naturally filter it. Wetlands are home for over 75% of the species in the [[Great Basin]]. However, the area's wetlands are at risk of being destroyed due to development around the city. While developers build on top of the wetlands they fill them with dirt destroying the habitat they create for the plants and animals. Washoe County has devised a plan that will help protect these ecosystems: mitigation. In the future, when developers try to build over a wetland, they will be responsible for creating another wetland near Washoe Lake.

The [[Truckee River]] serves as Reno's primary source of drinking water. It supplies Reno with {{convert|80|e6U.S.gal|lk=out}} of water a day during the summer, and {{convert|40|e6U.S.gal}} of water per day in the winter. Before the water goes to the homes around the Reno area, it must go to one of two [[water treatment]] plants, Chalk Bluff or Glendale Water Treatment Plant. As an attempt to save water, [[golf course]]s in Reno, like Arrow Creek Golf Course, have been using treated effluent water instead of treated water from one of Reno's water plants.

The Reno-Sparks [[Sewage treatment|wastewater treatment]] plant discharges tertiary treated [[effluent]] to the Truckee River. In the 1990s this capacity was increased from 20 to 30&amp;nbsp;million U.S. gallons (70 to 110&amp;nbsp;million liters) per day. While treated, the effluent contains suspended solids, [[nitrogen]], and [[phosphorus]], aggravating water quality concerns of the river and its receiving waters of [[Pyramid Lake (Nevada)|Pyramid Lake]]. Local agencies working with the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] have developed a number of watershed management strategies to accommodate this expanded effluent discharge; to accomplish this successful outcome, the [[DSSAM Model]] was developed and calibrated for the Truckee River in order to analyze the most cost-effective available management strategy set.&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan, Marc Papineau et al. 1987. ''Development of a dynamic water quality simulation model for the Truckee River'', Earth Metrics Inc., Environmental Protection Agency Technology Series, Washington D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;  The resulting management strategies included a package of measures such as [[land use]] controls in the Lake Tahoe basin, urban [[surface runoff|runoff]] controls in Reno and Sparks, and [[best management practice for water pollution|best management practice]]s for wastewater discharge.

The Reno area is frequently subject to [[wildfire]]s, causing property damage and sometimes loss of life. In August 1960, the Donner Ridge fire resulted in a loss of electricity to the city for four days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Weather and Climate of the Reno-Carson City-Lake Tahoe Region: Nevada Bureau of Mines and Geology Special Publication 34| url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-BWgg69xcGsC&amp;pg=PA53| year=2007| publisher=NV Bureau of Mines &amp; Geology| isbn=1-888035-11-0|page=53|accessdate=2013-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2011, arcing from powerlines caused a fire in Caughlin in southwest Reno that destroyed 26 homes and killed one older man, and only two months later in January 2012 another fire in Washoe Drive sparked by fireplace ashes destroyed 29 homes and killed one older woman. Around 10,000 residents were evacuated, and a state of emergency was declared. The fires came at the end of Reno's longest recorded dry spell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/weather/wildfires/story/2012-01-20/reno-nevada-fire/52688260/1| title='Remorseful' man admits he caused Reno blaze| last=Magerum| first=Liz| agency=Associated Press| date=January 20, 2012| work=USA Today| accessdate=February 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geology===
{{see also|Reno earthquakes of 2008}}
[[File:Dog Valley.jpg|thumb|left|Dog Valley, west of Reno, an area of active faulting]]
Reno is situated just east of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] on the western edge of the [[Great Basin]] at an elevation of about {{convert|4400|ft}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]]. Numerous [[fault (geology)|faults]] exist throughout the region. Most of these are [[Dip-slip faults|normal]] (vertical motion) faults associated with the uplift of the various mountain ranges, including the Sierra Nevada.

In February 2008, an [[earthquake swarm]] began to occur, with some quakes registering between 4 and 4.5 on the [[Richter magnitude scale|Richter scale]]. The earthquakes were centered around the Somersett community in western Reno near the areas of [[Mogul, Nevada|Mogul]] and [[Verdi, Nevada|Verdi]]. Many homes in these areas were damaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Swarm of earthquakes shakes Reno area| date=April 30, 2008| url=http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/2008/04/30/20080430renoquakes0430-ON.html| author=Ashley Powers| coauthors=Thomas H. Maugh II| work=Los Angeles Times| accessdate=August 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===
Reno sits in the [[rain shadow]] of the Sierra Nevada mountain range. Annual rainfall averages {{convert|7.48|in|mm|0}}. Despite this low amount of rainfall per year, Reno features a [[steppe climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''BSk'') due to its low [[evapotranspiration]]. Annual precipitation has ranged from {{convert|1.55|in|mm|1}} in 1947 to {{convert|13.23|in|mm|1}} in 1983. The most precipitation in one month was {{convert|5.25|in|mm|1}} in December 1955 and the most precipitation in 24 hours was {{convert|2.29|in|mm|1}} on January 21, 1943.  Winter has snowfall which is usually light to moderate but can be heavy some days, averaging {{convert|21.5|in|cm|0}} annually. Snowfall varies with the lowest amounts (roughly 19–23&amp;nbsp;inches annually) at the lowest part of the valley at and east of the [[Reno–Tahoe International Airport]] at {{convert|4404|ft}}, while the foothills of the [[Carson Range]] to the west ranging from {{convert|4700|to|5600|ft}} in elevation just a few miles west of downtown can receive up to two to three times as much annual snowfall. The mountains of the [[Virginia Range]] to the east can receive more summer thunderstorms and precipitation, and around twice as much annual snowfall above {{convert|5500|ft}}. However, Snowfall increases in the Virginia Range are less dramatic as elevation climbs than in the Carson Range to the west, because the Virginia Range is well within the rain shadow of the Sierra Nevada and Carson Range. The most snowfall in the city in one year was {{convert|63.8|in|cm|0}} in 1971, and the most snowfall in one month was {{convert|29.0|in|cm|0}} in March 1952.

Most [[precipitation (meteorology)|rainfall]] occurs in winter and spring.  The city has 300 days of sunshine per year. Summer thunderstorms can occur between April and October. The eastern side of town and the mountains east of Reno tend to be prone to thunderstorms more often, and these storms may be severe because an afternoon downslope west wind, called a &quot;Washoe Zephyr&quot;, can develop in the Sierra Nevada, causing air to be pulled down in the Sierra Nevada and Reno, destroying or preventing thunderstorms, but the same wind can push air upwards against the Virginia Range and other mountain ranges east of Reno, creating powerful thunderstorms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Reno, NV |url=http://www.visitrenotahoe.com/destination/reno %7CReno Tahoe Visitors website |accessdate=June 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=-BWgg69xcGsC&amp;pg=PA71&amp;dq=climate+of+reno+tahoe#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Google Books |publisher=Google Books|isbn=9781888035117|date=2007-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The monthly daily average temperature ranges from {{convert|35.3|°F|1}} in December to {{convert|74.9|°F|1}} in July, with the [[diurnal temperature variation]] reaching {{convert|35|F-change}} in summer, still lower than much of the high desert to the east. There are 3.9 days of {{convert|100|°F|0}}+ highs, 58 days of {{convert|90|°F|0}}+ highs, and 2.5 nights with sub-{{convert|10|°F|0}} lows annually;&lt;ref&gt;[ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/normals/1981-2010/products/station/USW00023185.normals.txt]&lt;/ref&gt; the temperature does not rise above freezing on only 5.1 days.&lt;ref name = NOAA/&gt; The all-time record high temperature is {{convert|108|°F|0}}, which occurred on July 10 and 11, 2002, and again on July 5, 2007. The all-time record low temperature is {{convert|-17|°F|0}}, which occurred on January 21, 1916.&lt;ref name = NOAA/&gt; In addition, the region is windy throughout the year; observers such as [[Mark Twain]] have commented about the &quot;[[Washoe Zephyr]]&quot;, northwestern Nevada's distinctive wind.

&lt;!-- do NOT include record temperatures from Weather.com. Its lowest temperature is {{convert|–16|°F|°C|abbr=on}}, which contradicts the text. --&gt;

==Government==
Reno has a democratic municipal government. The [[city council]] is the core of the government, with seven members. Five of these council people represent districts of Reno, and are vetted in the [[primary election|primary]] by the citizens of each district. In general, the top two vote earners in each ward make the ballot for the city-wide election. The other two council members are the at-large member, who represents the entire city, and the mayor, who is elected by the people of the city. The council has several duties, including setting priorities for the city, promoting communication with the public, planning development, and redevelopment.

There is an elected [[city attorney]] who is responsible for civil and criminal cases. The City Attorney represents the city government in court, and prosecutes misdemeanors.

The city's charter calls for a [[council-manager government|council-manager]] form of government, meaning that the council appoints only two positions, the [[city manager]], who implements and enforces the policies and programs the council approves, and the [[city clerk]]. The city manager is in charge of the budget and workforce for all city programs. The city clerk, who records the proceedings of the council, makes appointments for the council, and makes sure efficient copying and printing services are available.

In 2010, there was a ballot question asking whether the Reno city government and the Washoe County government should explore the idea of becoming one combined governmental body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Combining local governments is questioned on ballot issue |first=Susan |last=Voyles |date=October 24, 2010 |work=Reno Gazette-Journal |url=http://www.rgj.com/article/20101024/NEWS19/10240345/1321/news }}{{dead link|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 54% of voters approved of the ballot measure to make an inquiry into consolidating the governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Election Results: Nevada |work=The New York Times |accessdate=November 3, 2010 |url=http://elections.nytimes.com/2010/results/nevada }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fire Department===
The city of Reno and the community of Truckee Meadows is protected by the Reno Fire Department (RFD) manning 19 fire stations (14 are in Reno city proper).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reno.gov/index.aspx?page=189 |title=City of Reno : Fire Department |publisher=Reno.gov |date=2013-03-20 |accessdate=2013-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reno.gov/index.aspx?page=253 |title=City of Reno : Administration |publisher=Reno.gov |date=2013-03-20 |accessdate=2013-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The RFD operates a fire apparatus fleet of 20 engines, 5 trucks, 2 rescue units, 2 hazardous material units, various support units, 2 technical rescue support units, 15 brush units, 3 water tenders, and 3 water rescue entry vehicles. In 2008, the RFD responded to over 38,000 emergency calls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=UnionCentrics.com |url=http://www.iaff731.org/index.cfm?section=10&amp;pagenum=325 |title=Reno Fire Fighters Association, IAFF Local 731 - Our Department |publisher=Iaff731.org |date= |accessdate=2013-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the percentage of adults with a bachelor degree or higher is 28.5% in Reno compared with 21.8 for Nevada.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} This compares with 55.1% for Seattle and 51.2% for San Francisco.

===Universities and colleges===
[[File:Reno with mountains.gif|thumb|right|An older picture showing part of the [[University of Nevada, Reno]] campus in the foreground]]

* The [[University of Nevada, Reno]] is the oldest university in the state of Nevada and Nevada System of Higher Education. In 1886, the state university, previously only a college preparatory school, moved from [[Elko, Nevada|Elko]] in remote northeastern Nevada to a site north of downtown Reno, where it became a full-fledged state college. The university grew slowly over the decades, but has begun to expand rapidly along with the rest of the state and currently has an enrollment of 16,867,&lt;ref name=StateUniversity.com&gt;{{cite web| title=University of Nevada, Reno General Information| url=http://www.stateuniversity.com/universities/NV/University_of_Nevada_Reno.html| work=U.S. University Directory| accessdate=September 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with most students hailing from within Nevada.  Among its specialties are [[mining engineering]], agriculture, journalism, business, and one of only two [[Basque people|Basque]] Studies programs in the nation. It houses the [[National Judicial College]]. The university was named one of the top 200 colleges in the nation in the most recent ''U.S. News and World Report'' National Universities category index.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=College Name |url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/search |title=Best College &amp;#124; Search &amp;#124; US News |publisher=Colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Truckee Meadows Community College]] (TMCC) is a regionally accredited, two-year institution which is part of the Nevada System of Higher Education. The college has an enrollment of approximately 13,000 students attending classes at a primary campus and four satellite centers. The college offers a wide range of academic and university transfer programs, occupational training, career enhancement workshops, and classes just for fun. TMCC offers associate of arts, associate of science, associate of applied science or associate of general studies degrees, one-year certificates, or certificates of completion in more than 50 career fields, including architecture, auto/diesel mechanics, criminal justice, [[dental hygienist|dental hygiene]], graphic design, musical theatre, nursing, and welding.
* [[Career College of Northern Nevada]] (CCNN) is a nationally accredited trade school that trains students in technical fields that support fast growing industries.  The college is locally owned and operated.  Employer advisory boards direct the college in order to provide skill training that is relevant to industry needs.
* [[University of Phoenix]] – Northern Nevada Campus is located in south Reno. The university faculty is a collection business and academic professionals from the local Reno area.
* Morrison University is located in the south side of Reno.
* The [[Nevada School of Law at Old College]] in Reno was the first law school established in the state of Nevada.  Its doors were open from 1981–1988.

===Public schools===
Public education is provided by the [[Washoe County School District]].
* Reno has twelve public high schools: [[Damonte Ranch High School|Damonte Ranch]], [[Galena High School (Nevada)|Galena]], [[Hug High School|Hug]], North Valleys High School, [[Robert McQueen High School|McQueen]], Regional Technical Institute (RTI), [[Reno High School|Reno]], Truckee Meadows Community College High School,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.tmcc.edu/highschool/ |title=TMCC High School |publisher=Tmcc.edu }}{{dead link|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Washoe, and [[Earl Wooster High School|Wooster]].
* There are three public high schools in neighboring Sparks, attended by many students who live in Reno: [[Edward C. Reed High School|Reed]], Spanish Springs, and Sparks High School.
* Reno-Sparks has 13 middle schools: Billinghurst, Clayton, [[Cold Springs Middle School|Cold Springs]], Depoali, Dilworth, Mendive, O'Brien, Pine, Shaw,Sparks, Swope, Traner, and Vaughn.

Before the late 1950s, Reno was the gambling capital of the United States, but in the last twenty years Las Vegas' rapid growth, [[American Airlines]]' 2000 buyout of [[Reno Air]], and the growth of [[Native American gaming]] in [[California]] have reduced its business. Older casinos were either torn down (Mapes Hotel, Fitzgerald's Nevada Club, Primadonna, Horseshoe Club, Harold's Club, Palace Club), or smaller casinos like the Comstock, Sundowner, Golden Phoenix, Kings Inn, Money Tree, Virginian, and Riverboat were either closed or were converted into condos.

Because of its location, Reno has traditionally drawn the majority of its California tourists and gamblers from the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] and [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], while [[Las Vegas metropolitan area|Las Vegas]] has historically served more tourists from [[Southern California]] and the [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] area.

Several local large hotel casinos have shown significant growth and have moved gaming further away from the Virginia Street core. These larger hotel casinos are the [[Atlantis Casino Resort|Atlantis]], the [[Peppermill Hotel Casino|Peppermill]] and the [[Grand Sierra Resort]]. The Peppermill was chosen as the most outstanding Reno gaming/hotel property by ''Casino Player'' and ''Nevada'' magazines. In 2005, the Peppermill Hotel Casino began a $300&amp;nbsp;million [[Tuscany|Tuscan]]-themed expansion.

In an effort to bring more tourism to the area, Reno holds several events throughout the year, most of which have been extremely successful. They include [[Hot August Nights]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.hotaugustnights.net/ |title=Hot August Nights |publisher=Hot August Nights |accessdate=August 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; (a classic car convention), [[Street Vibrations]] (a motorcycle fan gathering and rally), [[The Great Reno Balloon Race]], a [[Cinco de Mayo]] celebration, [[bowling]] tournaments (held in the [[National Bowling Stadium]]), and the [[Reno Air Races]].

Several large commercial developments were constructed during the mid-2000s boom, such as [[The Summit (Reno, Nevada)|The Summit]] in 2007 and [[Outlets at Legends|Legends at Sparks Marina]] in 2008.

Reno is the location of the [[corporate headquarters]] for numerous companies, including [[Braeburn Capital]], [[Hamilton (company)|Hamilton]], [[EE Technologies]], [[Port of Subs]], [[PC-Doctor]], and [[International Game Technology]], which manufactures [[slot machine]]s. [[Bally Technologies]] and GameTech have development and manufacturing presence in Reno.

[[File:I80downtownreno.jpg|thumb|[[Interstate 80 in Nevada|I-80]] in Downtown Reno|alt=A 6-lane freeway passing under a series of underpasses]]

===Roads===
Reno was historically served by the [[Victory Highway]] and a branch of the [[Lincoln Highway]]. After the formation of the [[United States Numbered Highways|U.S. Numbered Highways]] system, [[U.S. Route 40]] was routed along 4th Street through downtown Reno, before being replaced by [[Interstate 80 in Nevada|Interstate 80]]. The primary north-south highway through Reno is [[U.S. Route 395 in Nevada|U.S. Route 395]]/[[Interstate 580 (Nevada)|Interstate 580]].

The [[Regional Transportation Commission of Washoe County]] (RTC) has a bus system that provides intracity buses, intercity buses to Carson City, and an on-demand shuttle service for disabled persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.rtcwashoe.com/public-transportation-5 |title=RTC Washoe |publisher=RTC Washoe |accessdate=August 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bus system has its main terminal on 4th Street in downtown Reno and secondary terminals in Sparks and at [[Meadowood Mall]] in south Reno.

Numerous shuttle and excursion services are offered connecting the [[Reno–Tahoe International Airport]] to various destinations:
*South Tahoe Express provides connecting shuttle service to [[South Lake Tahoe, California|South Lake Tahoe]] resorts.
*Eastern Sierra Transit Authority provides shuttles to destinations south along the US-395 corridor in California, such as [[Mammoth Mountain]] and [[Lancaster, California|Lancaster]]
*Modoc Sage Stage provides shuttles to [[Alturas, California|Alturas]] and [[Susanville, California]], along the northern US-395 corridor.

===Railroads===
Reno was historically a stopover along the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]]; the modern [[Overland Route (Union Pacific Railroad)|Overland Route]] continues to run through Reno. Reno was historically the southern terminus of the [[Nevada–California–Oregon Railway]] (NCO) and the northern terminus of the [[Virginia and Truckee Railroad]]. Using the NCO depot and right of way, the [[Western Pacific Railroad]] historically provided rail service to Reno. Downtown Reno has two historic train depots, the inactive [[Nevada-California-Oregon Railroad Depot]] and the still active [[Reno (Amtrak station)|Amtrak depot]], originally built by the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]].

[[Amtrak]] provides daily passenger service to Reno via the ''[[California Zephyr]]'' and multiple [[Amtrak Thruway Motorcoach]]es connecting to trains departing from [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]].

===Air===
The city is served by [[Reno–Tahoe International Airport]], with general aviation traffic handled by [[Reno Stead Airport]].

Reno was the hub and headquarters of the defunct airline [[Reno Air]].

==Utilities==
Potable water for the city of Reno is provided by the [[Truckee Meadows Water Authority]]. The [[Truckee River]] is the primary water source, with purification being done at two plants, Chalk Bluff and Glendale. The Chalk Bluff plant's main intakes are west of Reno in [[Verdi, Nevada|Verdi]], with the water flowing through a series of [[flume]]s and ditches to the plant itself. Alternative intakes are located below the plant along the banks of the Truckee River itself. The Glendale plant is sited alongside the river, and is fed by a rock and concrete rubble [[diversion dam]] a short distance upstream.&lt;ref name=&quot;tmwa&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://tmwa.com/| title=Truckee Meadows Water Authority}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sewage treatment for the majority of the Truckee Meadows region takes place at the Truckee Meadows Water Reclamation Facility at the eastern edge of the valley. Treated effluent returns to the Truckee River by way of Steamboat Creek.&lt;ref name=&quot;tmwrf&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://cityofsparks.us/departments/community-services/tmwrf| title=Truckee Meadows Water Reclamation Facility}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Electrical power and natural gas are provided by [[NV Energy]], formerly Sierra Pacific. Power comes from multiple sources, including [[Tracy-Clark Station]] to the east, and the [[Steamboat Springs, Nevada|Steamboat Springs]] [[binary cycle]] power plants at the southern end of town.

The [[Reno Barons]], an independent professional indoor football team, played at the [[Reno Events Center]] in 2011.

Reno is expected to be the future home of an [[ECHL]] ice hockey team, currently named the [[Reno Raiders]], but construction on a suitable arena has yet to begin as of the 2011–2012 season. The franchise has been dormant since 1998, when it was named the [[Reno Rage]], and earlier the [[Reno Renegades]], and played in the now-defunct [[West Coast Hockey League]] (WCHL).

The [[Reno–Tahoe Open]] is northern Nevada's only [[PGA Tour]] event, held at Montrêux Golf &amp; Country Club in Reno.

[[File:Reno River Festival at Reno Whitewater Park.jpg|thumb|Reno Whitewater Festival at the whitewater park in Reno]]

In 2004, the city completed a $1.5&amp;nbsp;million whitewater park on the Truckee River in downtown Reno which hosts [[whitewater]] events throughout the year. The course runs Class 2 and 3 rapids with year-round public access. The {{convert|1400|ft|m|sing=on}} north channel features more aggressive rapids, drop pools and &quot;holes&quot; for rodeo kayak-type maneuvers. The milder {{convert|1200|ft|abbr=on}} south channel is set up as a kayak slalom course and a beginner area.

Reno is home to two [[roller derby]] teams, the [[Battle Born Derby Demons]] and the Reno Roller Girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=There are two roller derby organizations in Reno—and don't ever make the mistake of confusing one for the other| author=Daniel Riggs| year= 2008| url=http://www.newsreview.com/reno/roll-with-the-punches/content?oid=871024| work=newsreview.com| accessdate=August 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Battle Born Derby Demons compete on flat tracks locally and nationally.

==Recreation==
[[File:Tahoe.JPG|right|thumb|Winter [[Ski]] slopes overlooking [[Lake Tahoe]]]]
Reno is home to a variety of recreation activities including both seasonal and year-round. In the summer, Reno locals can be found near three major bodies of water: [[Lake Tahoe]], the [[Truckee River]], and [[Pyramid Lake (Nevada)|Pyramid Lake]]. The Truckee River originates at Lake Tahoe and flows west to east through the center of downtown Reno before terminating at Pyramid Lake to the north. The river is a major part of [[Artown]], held in the summer at Wingfield Park. [[Washoe Lake]] is a popular kite and [[windsurfing]] location because of its high wind speeds during the summer.

Skiing and snowboarding are among the most popular winter sports and draw in many tourists. There are 18 ski resorts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About Reno-Sparks |url=http://www.reno-sparkschamber.org/visitation.htm |publisher=Reno Sparks Chamber of Commerce |accessdate=September 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (8 major resorts) located as close as {{convert|11|mi}} and as far as {{convert|98|mi}} from the Reno–Tahoe International Airport, including [[Northstar California]], [[Sierra-at-Tahoe]], [[Alpine Meadows, California|Alpine Meadows]], [[Squaw Valley Ski Resort|Squaw Valley]], [[Sugar Bowl Ski Resort|Sugar Bowl]], [[Diamond Peak (ski area)|Diamond Peak]], [[Heavenly Mountain Resort|Heavenly Mountain]], and [[Mount Rose Ski Tahoe|Mount Rose]].
