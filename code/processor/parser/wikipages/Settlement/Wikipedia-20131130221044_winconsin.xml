'''Ashland''' is a city in [[Ashland County, Wisconsin|Ashland]] and [[Bayfield County, Wisconsin|Bayfield]] counties in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Wisconsin]]. The city is a port on [[Lake Superior]], near the head of [[Chequamegon Bay]]. The population was 8,216 at the 2010 census. All of the population resided in the Ashland County portion of the city, which actually comprises 99.943% of its area. The tiny unpopulated Bayfield County portion is located in the city's southwest, bordered by the easternmost part of the Town of [[Eileen, Wisconsin|Eileen]].

The city is situated at the junction of [[U.S. Route 2]] and [[Wisconsin Highway 13]]. It is the home of [[Northland College (Wisconsin)|Northland College]] and the [[Sigurd Olson Environmental Institute]].

== History ==
&lt;!-- History that follows is taken from the Ashland Chamber of Commerce website at http://www.visitashland.com/overview/ and is USED WITH PERMISSION! --&gt;

=== Pre-settlement ===
Four flags have flown over the area around Ashland: [[Spain|Spanish]], [[France|French]], [[England|English]] and [[United States|American]]. Eight different [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] nations have lived on [[Chequamegon Bay]]. Later settlers included [[Europe]]an explorers, [[Missionary|missionaries]] and [[fur trade]]rs, and more recently, [[Yankee]]s who platted and developed the lands, railroaders, shippers, [[Logging|loggers]], [[entrepreneur]]s, and other [[settler]]s. The area was part of the [[Northwest Territory]] and was subsequently part of four successive territories before becoming part of the state of Wisconsin: [[Indiana Territory]], [[Michigan Territory]], [[Illinois Territory]], and [[Wisconsin Territory]].

About the time [[Christopher Columbus]] arrived in the [[New World]], the [[Ojibwe]] people came to the land they called Sha-ga-waun-il-ong. This term has been translated numerous ways: &quot;lowlands&quot;, the &quot;needle&quot;, &quot;the region of shallow water&quot;, and where &quot;there are large extended breakers&quot;. Each is descriptive and suitably accurate.

The Ojibwe stayed on Chequamegon Point for about a century before leaving, first to settle on [[Madeline Island]] and then to move to the Sault region.

French fur traders [[Pierre-Esprit Radisson|Pierre d'Esprit, le Sieur Radisson]] and [[Médard des Groseilliers|Medard Chouart, le Sieur des Groseillers]] were the first Europeans of record to visit Chequamegon Bay. They arrived in 1659 and built what has been called the first European dwelling place in Wisconsin. A historical marker is located at Maslowski Beach on [[U.S. Route 2]] on the west end of Ashland. The monument was erected in 1929 by the Old Settlers Club.

The Ojibwe heartily welcomed the Frenchmen. Five years later, Father [[Claude-Jean Allouez]] arrived. A [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] missionary, he brought the first word of [[Christianity]] to Wisconsin's shores. Allouez built a chapel not far from Radisson's and Groseillier's stockade and remained at the Bay until 1669.

=== Settlement ===
In 1854, [[Ohio]]ans Asaph Whittlesey and George Kilborn set out from [[La Pointe, Wisconsin|La Pointe]] to explore the head of Chequamegon Bay. Whittlesey built a {{convert|10|ft|m|abbr=on}} × {{convert|14|ft|m|abbr=on}} cabin in Ashland. His wife, Lucy, and daughter, Eugenia, joined him in August and prepared to winter in their new home. Signs of civilization quickly followed. The first community dance was held at their house. The Reverend L.H. Wheeler preached the first sermon on the first [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] that was observed there. It was the location of the first [[post office]] and polling place for county offices. [[Sunday school]] was also conducted on the premises.

Other dates of note:
* 1856 — First [[plat]] of Ashland registered
* 1870 — First Ashland [[brownstone]] quarried and shipped
* 1872 — First [[sawmill]] built by W.R. Sutherland
* 1877 — [[Wisconsin Central Railroad (1871-1899)|Wisconsin Central Railroad]] connected Ashland to [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]]
* 1877 — Chequamegon Hotel opened, one block from current hotel
* 1887 — State legislature incorporated the City of Ashland
* 1889 — Wisconsin Central Depot constructed
* 1892 — Northern Wisconsin Academy opened (now [[Northland College (Wisconsin)|Northland College]])
* 1894 — Post office built
* 1904 — Ashland High School opened
* 1929 — First airport opened
* 1940 — [[WATW]] radio went on the air
* 1963 — Dedication of the [[Apostle Islands National Lakeshore]]
* 1972 — Memorial Medical Center opened

'''Montreal''' is a city in [[Iron County, Wisconsin|Iron County]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States]]. The population was 807 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. The neighborhood of [[Montreal, Wisconsin#Gile|Gile]] is part of the city; however, it still has its own post office and ZIP code: 54525.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uszip.com/zip/54525&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Montreal was named for the Montreal Mining Company, which had several copper and iron ore mines in the area during the late 1800s. During the early 1900s, miners settled near the mine shaft and leased the land from the mining company.  However, in 1918, in order to retain workers, the company initiated a program that rented pre-fabricated homes to miners. The [[Montreal Company Location Historic District]], which includes several of these company town houses, was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1980 as a national example of industrial community planning.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com/WI/Iron/state.html&lt;/ref&gt; The ore deposits left from Montreal's mining days can still be seen from [[Wisconsin Highway 77]].

==Gile==
Gile is a neighborhood of Montreal which was once its own [[unincorporated community]]. The community originally developed as a [[sawmill]] village.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Around the shores of Lake Superior: a guide to historic sites |last=Bogue |first=Margaret |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2007 |publisher=[[University of Wisconsin]] Press |location= |isbn= |page=315 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though it is part of Montreal, Gile has its own [[post office]] with [[ZIP code]]: 54525.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zipinfo.com/cgi-local/zipsrch.exe?cnty=cnty&amp;zip=54525&amp;Go=Go ZIP Code Lookup]&lt;/ref&gt; Gile is located {{convert|.75|mi|km}} to the east-southeast of Montreal, along the Gile Flowage, a shallow lake formed by a dam on the West Fork of the [[Montreal River (Wisconsin–Michigan)|Montreal River]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lakelubbers.com/gile-flowage-486/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fountain City''' is a city in [[Buffalo County, Wisconsin|Buffalo County]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Wisconsin]]. The population was 859 at the [[United States Census, 2010|2010 census]].

==History==
Fountain City was originally called Holmes' Landing, after Thomas Holmes, who settled there in 1839.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buffalocounty.com/Brief%20History.htm Buffalo County History]&lt;/ref&gt;  Riverboats would stop at the landing to take on firewood, as well as water from springs not far from the river, leading to the name of Fountain City.

==Geography==
Fountain City is located at {{coord|44|7|28|N|91|42|34|W|type:city}} (44.124506, -91.709470),{{GR|1}} at the intersection of highways 35 and 95.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|5.57|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which, {{convert|4.29|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|1.28|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.&lt;ref name =&quot;Gazetteer files&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city is located on a bend in the Mississippi River, where the river flows right at the base of the bluffs on the east side of the valley. Because of this, at some points the city is only two houses wide; one on each side of [[Wisconsin Highway 35]]. Eagle Creek and Waumandee Creek flow into Fountain City Bay northwest of the city limits. Eagle Creek flows around the base of Eagle Bluff, one of the tallest bluffs along the Mississippi.

The steep bluffs are characteristic of the [[Driftless Area]] of [[Wisconsin]], [[Minnesota]], and [[Iowa]], a region that was not smoothed over by glacier like much of the rest of the midwest, but rather deeply cut by runoff from the rapidly melting glaciers.

[[Merrick State Park]] is located a short distance up Fountain City Bay, a slough of the river.

The [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] maintains a base on the north side of town. It was the long-time home of the dredge [[William A. Thompson]], which the Corps used to maintain the {{convert|9|ft|m|sing=on}} shipping depth of the Mississippi's Main Channel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mvp.usace.army.mil/docs/nav/dredge_wat.pdf USACE Document on William A. Thompson]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rails===
Montello was once the eastern terminus of a spur line of the Wisconsin Central Railroad, built in 1882 to service the granite quarry and other industries in Montello. This line split from the WC's Stevens Point-Portage line (the &quot;P&quot; Line) at Packwaukee, and ran along the north shore of Buffalo Lake to Montello. The P-Line was abandoned in 1946 along with the Montello spur, despite the fact that there was still almost daily service on it.

'''Hurley''' is a city in and the [[county seat]] of [[Iron County, Wisconsin|Iron County]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States]]. The population was 1,543 at the 2010 census. It is located directly across the Montreal River from [[Ironwood, Michigan]].

==History==
Hurley is located on the [[Montreal River (Wisconsin–Michigan)|Montreal River]], the border between Wisconsin and the [[Upper Peninsula]] of [[Michigan]]. It was founded to serve the interest of both lumbermen and miners. Hurley and adjacent Gile were lumber towns, while nearby mining towns included [[Montreal, Wisconsin|Montreal]], [[Ironwood, Michigan]], [[Bessemer, Michigan]] and [[Wakefield, Michigan]].

Hurley took its name from M. A. Hurley, a prominent attorney of [[Wausau, Wisconsin|Wausau]] who won a lawsuit for the Northern Chief Iron Company in 1884. The compensation for winning the suit was that he asked for no fee, but only requested that the town involved in the case be named after him. The full name &quot;Glen Hurley&quot; was used for one year, but in 1885, the first name was dropped and the community became known as Hurley.

Henry Meade was the first mayor of Hurley, Wisconsin. John Ankers opened Hurley’s first saloon, and served as Hurley’s first town clerk, first justice of the peace, and first fire chief.

The ''Gogebic Range Directory'' of 1888 states: &quot;During the past summer, Hurley was twice visited by terrible fires. The first occurred of June 28 and the second on July 9. These destroyed almost the entire business portion of the city, and at first it was thought that they would prove a crushing blow to its prosperity, but later events have proven that they were blessings in disguise. The wonderful pluck and energy of its businessmen were fully demonstrated when they at once began the erection of fine brick buildings in the place of the wooden ones destroyed. The result has been that the burned portion has been rebuilt with brick and stone, making them nearly fireproof. And Silver Street is one that a much larger city could well be proud of.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

Hurley was also the permanent home of Delia Zarzyski, where she lived the entirety of her 89 years with her husband Leonard Zarzyski. Living on Poplar Street their entire lives, they had three sons, one of whom was renowned [[Cowboy poetry|cowboy poet]] [[Paul Zarzyski]] who performs across the country and wrote hundreds of poems and multiple books.&lt;ref name=&quot;Delia Zarzyski's Obituary&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.paulzarzyski.com/newflashes/nf_deezarzyski.html |title=Delia Zarzyski's Obituary |publisher=Dailyglobe.com |date=August 26, 2010 |location=Ironwood, Michigan|accessdate=March 11, 2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historic locations===
[[File:2009-0617-OldIronCtyCourthouse-Hurley.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The Old Iron County Courthouse (now the Iron County Historical Museum), is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.[http://www.nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com/WI/Iron/state.html]]]
The Iron Exchange Bank of Hurley, was the oldest [[bank]] of the [[Gogebic Range]]. It was organized November 26, 1885. Dr. J.C. Reynolds, the bank’s first president, and his brother, W. S. Reynolds, the bank’s first cashier, were the prime movers in the organization of the institution. Associated with them in the organization were John E. Burton, Alvin E. Tyler, Edward Ryan, Nathaniel J. Moore, James A. Wood, and Shepherd Homans, all men prominent in the mining industry in the area in the early days. By 1925, when it celebrated its 40th anniversary, it had withstood all financial depressions.

The first meat market in Hurley was kept by Ilsey and Knox and was opened in 1885.

The first newspaper in Hurley was the Montreal River Miner which was first published on October 8, 1885. After absorbing the Iron County News in 1950 the two papers names were merged to form the Iron County Miner which is still published as a weekly.&lt;ref&gt;Guide to Wisconsin  Newspapers-1833-1957; compiled by Donald E. Oehlerts&lt;/ref&gt;

The first hotel was located at the corner of Second Avenue and Silver Street in a log building, with James Guest as the first landlord. It was far from a pretentious affair but answered the purpose and furnished food and shelter for many a pioneer and miner in its day.

The [[Burton House (Hurley, Wisconsin)|Burton House]] was an immense four-story frame hostelry, which was a famous gathering place in the latter part of the 19th century. John E. Burton erected the building in 1865. A mining speculator, his original wealth came from the iron range. Later he established offices in New York City and bought up other vast mining interests in Mexico and South America. The Burton Hotel contained 100 rooms, a ballroom, dining room, café, and clubrooms, all highly decorated and furnished with the best of the wood workers’ art of the time, and equipped with the best furniture. The Burton Hotel cost $35,000 to construct, and the furniture cost Burton $10,000. Many noteworthy people stayed at the Burton House. [[Grover Cleveland]] registered at the Burton House Saturday, October 5, 1889. By that time he had already served one term as president of the United States. In 1889 when he was in Hurley, he was a New York lawyer. He was elected to the presidency again in 1892.

All of it was in the Racine County portion of the city.

==History==
Prior to the arrival of [[European ethnic groups|Europeans]] in the area, [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[mound]]s were constructed in what is now Burlington. Although around 1830 a small [[Potawatomi]] village stood in what is now the [[Burlington (town), Wisconsin|Town of Burlington]],&lt;ref name=&quot;pg1&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Burlington, Wisconsin: The First 150+ Years |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; there was no Native American settlement in the area encompassed by the present city.

The earliest certain European presence in what is now Burlington was in the fall of 1799, when a group of [[France|French]] [[explorer]]s and [[missionary|missionaries]], led by [[Francis Morgan de Vereceones]], made a [[portage]] from the [[Root River (Wisconsin)|Root River]] to the [[Fox River (Illinois River tributary)|Fox River]], reaching the Fox at about Burlington's present location.&lt;ref name=&quot;firsteuropean&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title=Probable That First White Man Passed Through What is Now City of Burlington in Fall of 1799 |work=The Standard Democrat |date=November 16, 1923 |location=Burlington, Wisconsin |url=http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/wlhba/articleView.asp?pg=1&amp;id=6497 |accessdate=2008-06-06 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest European settlers in Burlington were four men: Moses and Lemuel Smith, the sons of a [[American Revolution|Revolutionary War]] veteran, Benjamin Perce, and William Whiting, all of whom arrived on December 27 or December 28, 1835&lt;ref name=&quot;pg3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Burlington, Wisconsin: The First 150+ Years |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and built a cabin;&lt;ref name=&quot;earlyhistory1&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title=Early History of City of Burlington |last=McCumber |work=The Racine Daily Journal |date=November 9, 1923 |location=[[Racine, Wisconsin]] |url=http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/wlhba/articleView.asp?pg=1&amp;id=6498 |accessdate=2008-06-06 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moses Smith and Whiting had been in the area previously, making a so-called &quot;jackknife claim&quot; (carving their names and the date on trees in the vicinity), on December 15, 1835.&lt;ref name=&quot;pg3&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;earlydays&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.burlingtonhistory.org/History.htm |title=Synopsis of Early Days of Burlington, Wisconsin |accessdate=2008-05-20 |date=2008-03-30 |publisher=Burlington Historical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other settlers arrived in the spring and summer of 1836, mostly from [[New England]];&lt;ref name=&quot;pg4&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Burlington, Wisconsin: The First 150+ Years |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; they named their settlement Foxville.&lt;ref name=&quot;earlydays&quot; /&gt; In 1836, the residents of what was then known as Foxville unanimously decided to change their settlement's name to &quot;Burlington&quot;, after [[Burlington, Vermont]];&lt;ref name=&quot;pg5&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Burlington, Wisconsin: The First 150+ Years |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foxville continued to be used, however, until the name was officially changed on July 15, 1839.&lt;ref name=&quot;earlydays&quot; /&gt;

Until that time, Foxville had been in [[Michigan Territory]]; on July 3, 1836, however, the act of [[United States Congress|Congress]] organizing the [[Wisconsin Territory]] went into effect. When counties were created, Foxville fell within the borders of Milwaukee County, which at that time included, the present-day county of [[Racine County, Wisconsin|Racine]]. On December 7, 1836, Racine County, containing Foxville, was separated from the rest of Milwaukee County.  Foxville became the official name of the settlement on March 21, 1837, when the first [[post office]] was created, with Moses Smith as the first [[postmaster]]. In May 1837, a [[sawmill]], the first [[framing (construction)|frame]] building in the settlement, and a [[dam]] on the [[Fox River (Illinois River tributary)|Fox River]] were completed.&lt;ref name=&quot;pg6&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Burlington, Wisconsin: The First 150+ Years |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 2, 1838, [[Rochester (town), Wisconsin|Rochester township]], which included Foxville, as well as all of Racine County west of [[Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin|Mount Pleasant]] was established. On March 9, 1839, [[Burlington (town), Wisconsin|Burlington township]], including at the time what is now the [[Dover, Racine County, Wisconsin|Town of Dover]] and much of [[Brighton, Kenosha County, Wisconsin|Brighton]], was separated from Rochester.&lt;ref name=&quot;pg6&quot; /&gt;

From 1844 to 1850, the town of [[Voree, Wisconsin|Voree]], just to the west of Burlington, was the headquarters of the [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite)]], one of many sects founded during the [[Succession crisis (Latter Day Saints)|succession crisis]] following the death of Mormon founder [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]].  Although Strang's group relocated to [[Beaver Island (Lake Michigan)|Beaver Island]], [[Michigan]] in 1850, his parents remained in Voree.  After Strang was shot by two disgruntled members in 1856, he was taken to Voree where he died.  He is buried in a cemetery in Burlington.  Strang's church still maintains a congregation in Voree, and the local historical society has erected a monument to the Mormon settlement there.

Burlington was incorporated as a [[village]] in 1886; in 1900 it became a city.&lt;ref name=&quot;earlydays&quot; /&gt;

==Law and government==
[[File:Burlington Wisconsin City Hall.jpg|thumb|right|City hall]]
Burlington has a [[mayor-council government|mayor-council]] form of government, with a [[city manager|city administrator]].&lt;ref name=&quot;econprofile&quot; /&gt;  The [[mayor]] is the city's [[chief executive]], responsible for seeing that [[state law]] and [[city ordinance]]s are enforced.&lt;ref name=&quot;mayor&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=City of Burlington Mayor |url=http://www.burlington-wi.gov/Departments/City_Hall/mayor_Miller.htm |publisher=City of Burlington |year=2008 |accessdate=2008-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mayors are elected to two-year terms;&lt;ref name=&quot;pg121&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Burlington, Wisconsin: The First 150+ Years |page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; the current mayor is Bob Miller.&lt;ref name=&quot;mayor&quot; /&gt;

The [[city council|Common Council]] is composed of eight [[alderman|aldermen]], two in each of Burlington's four districts.&lt;ref name=&quot;council&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Aldermanic Representatives  |url=http://www.burlington-wi.gov/Departments/City_Hall/council.htm |publisher=City of Burlington |year=2008 |accessdate=2008-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In every year's spring election, one alderman is elected from each district.  Aldermen serve two-year terms.

The city administrator is appointed by the Common Council to oversee the routine operations of the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;administrator&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=City of Burlington City Administrator |url=http://www.burlington-wi.gov/Departments/City_Hall/city_administrator.htm |publisher=City of Burlington |year=2008 |accessdate=2008-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2004}}, the Burlington Police Department employed 32 full-time personnel; the Fire Department employed four full-time personnel and 50 volunteer firefighters.&lt;ref name=&quot;econprofile&quot; /&gt;

==Education==
The first school classes in Burlington were taught in 1838. One of the first teachers was [[William P. Lyon]], later a [[List of Wisconsin Supreme Court Justices|Justice of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin]]. The settlement's first [[school]]house was built in 1839, and classes were taught there irregularly for the next 15 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;pg10&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Burlington, Wisconsin: The First 150+ Years |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; An act of the [[Wisconsin Legislature]] in 1857 incorporated the Burlington Union School District of Racine County. In 1858 and 1859, a schoolhouse was built for the district's use.&lt;ref name=&quot;pg26&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Burlington, Wisconsin: The First 150+ Years |page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Now called [[Lincoln School (Burlington, Wisconsin)]], the building is now used as the headquarters for the Burlington Area School District. Early quarrels about the management and costs of the school led to the creation of two rival [[school board]]s, each claiming to be legal; a new board gained control in 1861, and lasting stability came to the system in 1872.&lt;ref name=&quot;pg26.27&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Burlington, Wisconsin: The First 150+ Years |pages=26−27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Private and parochial schools===
Burlington's first [[private school]], the Burlington Academy, was founded in 1844 as a result of dissatisfaction with the other schools operating at the time. One of its early teachers was [[John F. Potter]], later a [[United States Congressional Delegations from Wisconsin|Congressman from Wisconsin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pg25.26&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Burlington, Wisconsin: The First 150+ Years |pages=25−26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Burlington Academy no longer operates.

==Media==
[[File:Burlington Standard Press Building Wisconsin.jpg|thumb|left|Burlington Free Press building]]
The first [[newspaper]] in the Burlington area was the ''Voree Herald'', published in [[Voree, Wisconsin|Voree]] in January 1846 by [[James Strang]], the leader of the [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite)]]. Its primary purpose was to inform his congregation about events in the wider [[Latter Day Saint movement]]. The paper was renamed the ''Gospel Herald'' in September 1847, and continued to be published until 1850, when most of the church relocated to [[Beaver Island (Lake Michigan)|Beaver Island]] in [[Lake Michigan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pg37&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Burlington, Wisconsin: The First 150+ Years |page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first newspaper published in Burlington intended for a general audience was the ''Weekly Burlington Gazette'', first published on April 8, 1858. The newspaper was strongly [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]&lt;ref name=&quot;pg25&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Burlington, Wisconsin: The First 150+ Years |page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continued until December 11, 1860, when its owner moved to [[Houston, Texas]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pg25&quot; /&gt;

From 1860 until 1863, no newspaper was published in Burlington.&lt;ref name=&quot;pg25&quot; /&gt;  On October 14, 1863, the ''Burlington Standard'', another Republican newspaper, was founded.&lt;ref name=&quot;pg37&quot; /&gt; In 1881, the paper became largely nonpartisan,&lt;ref name=&quot;pg37&quot; /&gt; but in April 1886, with a new owner, the paper was renamed the ''Standard Democrat'' and became strongly pro-[[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pg38&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Burlington, Wisconsin: The First 150+ Years |page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1896 to 1911, the ''Standard Democrat'' was also published in [[German language|German]] under the name ''Der Standard Demokrat''.&lt;ref name=&quot;pg38&quot; /&gt;

The ''Burlington Democrat'', a newspaper with Democratic leanings, was first published in 1880 as a counter to the Republican ''Burlington Standard''. Its name was soon changed to the ''Burlington Free Press'', and its leanings changed to Republican at about the same time the ''Standard'' became the ''Standard Democrat''.&lt;ref name=&quot;pg38&quot; /&gt;

The [[weekly newspaper|weekly]] ''[[Burlington Standard Press]]''  is currently published in Burlington;&lt;ref name=&quot;econprofile&quot; /&gt; the [[daily newspaper|daily]] ''[[Racine Journal-Times]]''&lt;ref name=&quot;econprofile&quot; /&gt; and ''[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]'' are also available in the area.

===Railroads===
[[File:Burlington Wisconsin Train Station.jpg|thumb|right|Train station]]
The first [[railroad]] to pass through Burlington was built in 1855 by the  Racine, Janesville and Mississippi Railroad Company.  Its construction nearly bankrupted [[Racine, Wisconsin|Racine]]. The line was later reorganized as the Western Union Railroad and eventually incorporated into the [[Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad|Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad Company]], .&lt;ref name=&quot;pg21&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Burlington, Wisconsin: The First 150+ Years |page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; (better known as the Milwaukee Road)  On the [[Milwaukee Road]], this line was referred to as the &quot;Racine &amp; Southwestern&quot; Division and is often referred to as the &quot;Southwestern&quot; Line.

In 1856, Burlington invested in the [[Fox River Valley Railroad of Wisconsin]], a planned railroad that would have started in [[Milwaukee]], connected to the railroad already in Burlington, and continued on to the [[Fox River Valley Railroad of Illinois]].  The roadbed was built, but because of the failure of the company, rails were never laid.&lt;ref name=&quot;pg21&quot; /&gt;

The railroad currently operating through Burlington was constructed in 1885-1886 by the [[Wisconsin Central Railroad (1871-1899)|Wisconsin Central Railroad]]. The Wisconsin Central was acquired by the Minneapolis St. Paul &amp; Sault Ste. Marie Railway in 1908, and later merged with the [[Duluth, South Shore and Atlantic Railway]] in 1961 to create the [[Soo Line Railroad]].

The Milwaukee Road operated its last train west of Burlington in 1982.  In 1985 the Soo Line purchased what remained of the Milwaukee Road, and reorganized their existing line through Burlington as a part of a new subsidiary known as Lakes States Transportation Division in 1986.  Lakes States did not achieve the cost savings that the Soo Line had envisioned and was sold to the new [[Wisconsin Central Transportation]], which commenced operations on October 11, 1987.  The Wisconsin Central Limited was acquired by the [[Canadian National Railway]] in 2001. The [[Canadian National Railway]] remains the operator of the rail line through Burlington.

'''Tomahawk''' is a city in [[Lincoln County, Wisconsin|Lincoln County]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States]]. The population was 3,346 at the 2010 census. The city is located to the northeast of the [[Tomahawk (town), Wisconsin|Town of Tomahawk]] and is not contiguous with it.

==History==
Before 1837, the land where Tomahawk is now situated belonged to the [[Ojibwe]], who traded actively with fur traders such as the [[American Fur Company]] and the [[Northwest Company]].  After the [[Treaty of St. Peters|1837 cession]], the practical situation changed only slightly: the federal survey teams had not arrived yet, logging activity was still light, and Ojibwe continued to actively occupy the general area.  There was a village just north of the modern Tomahawk, in the vicinity of modern [[Bradley (community), Lincoln County, Wisconsin|Bradley]], and a village on Skanawan Creek.&lt;ref&gt;{{coord|45|25|40|N|89|41|34|W|display=inline}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Jones, George O. ''et al'' [http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm/ref/collection/wch/id/65825 ''History of Lincoln, Oneida and Vilas Counties, Wisconsin''] (Minneapolis: H.C. Cooper, Jr., &amp; Co., 1924), p. 9.
&lt;/ref&gt;
The 1854 [[Treaty of La Pointe]] created the reservations at [[Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa|Lac du Flambeau]], [[Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians|Lac Courte Oreilles]] and [[Bad River Chippewa Band|Bad River]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news | author=Danziger, Edmund J | title=They Would Not Be Moved: The Chippewa Treaty of 1854 | work=Minnesota History, Spring 1973 | pages=173–185 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Yet even after this treaty, access to the general area remained unrestricted, being not yet sold to private entities by the federal government, and since some Ojibwe received their annuity payments in [[Wausau, Wisconsin|Wausau]] they continued to occupy these local villages to some extent until the annuities ran out in 1874.&lt;ref&gt;
Marchetti, Louis [http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm/ref/collection/wch/id/61858 ''History of Marathon County, Wisconsin and Representative Citizens''] (Chicago: Richmond-Arnold Pub. Co., 1913), p. 98.
&lt;/ref&gt;
By that time most Ojibwe became permanently established on the reservations.

Logging activity from the Tomahawk River upstream began about 1860 and surged after the [[Civil War]].  By 1880 several families were living close to Tomahawk-Wisconsin river confluence, including owning property within the present city limits of Tomahawk.&lt;ref&gt;
The 1880 census lists two families named Bouchard, one named King, and one named Faufau, who all pre-empted property inside the present-day city limits.  In addition, Gilbert Vallier had a station at Skanawan Creek and owned a 40 acre hay field on the eastern edge of the present city limits.
&lt;/ref&gt;
The location was variously known as Bouchard's Station&lt;ref&gt;
Warner, Hans B., Editor [http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/WI.WIBlueBk1880 ''The blue book of the state of Wisconsin (1880)''] The map on the frontispiece shows &quot;Boucharels Station,&quot; an obvious misspelling of &quot;Bouchard.&quot;
&lt;/ref&gt; or The Forks,&lt;ref&gt;
Jones ''et al'', p. 68.
&lt;/ref&gt;
short for Forks of the Wisconsin.&lt;ref&gt;
Calkins, Hiram &quot;Indian Nomenclature, and the Chippewas,&quot; ''Wisconsin Historical Collections, Volume I'' (Madison: State Historical Society of Wisconsin, 1854), p. 120.  Many early maps gave the Tomahawk River the name Little Wisconsin River.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Tomahawk traditionally traces its founding to the establishment of the construction camps for a dam and the railroad in 1886.  The company leading the effort was the Tomahawk Land and Boom Company, headed by [[William H. Bradley (Wisconsin businessman)|William H. Bradley]], who is thus considered to be the principal founder of Tomahawk.  The town site was platted in 1887, with lots sold in Milwaukee that summer.  The city was incorporated in 1891.  In the 10 years after the first construction camps were built, Tomahawk grew rapidly, boasting many stores, a three-story hotel, many saw mills, a paper mill, and service via three railroads.&lt;ref&gt;Jones ''et al'', pp. 68-84.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the events highlighting Tomahawk's history since that time are:
*'''1897:''' The first high school class graduates.  Among the graduates is Margaret McBride, who achieves prominence as a vocalist in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;Jones ''et al'', p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''1906:''' William T. Bradley, future mayor and adopted son of the city's founder, brings the first automobile to the town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Cindy Johnson - American Local History Network - Wisconsin |url=http://www.wlhn.org/counties/histtom3.html |title=Tomahawk, Wisconsin - American Local History Network - Wisconsin |publisher=Wlhn.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''1914:''' The first airplane lands on north Tomahawk Avenue, there being no other runway yet.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}
*'''1917:''' Tomahawk men enlist and form Company A, 119th Machine Gun Battalion, which is deployed to Europe via [[Waco, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;Jones ''et al'', p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''1929:''' The iconic Mitchell Hotel burns down, nearly taking the entire downtown with it.  A new pump brought in from the [[Phillips, Wisconsin|Phillips]] fire department is the only thing that saves the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Brian Morren @ Wilderness Web Studio |url=http://www.tomahawkfd.org/mitchell_hotel_fire.htm |title=Tomahawk Fire Department |publisher=Tomahawkfd.org |date=1929-03-06 |accessdate=2013-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''1936:''' Tomahawk celebrates its 50th anniversary.  The activities include a visit by Governor [[Philip La Follette]].&lt;ref&gt;''Tomahawk Leader'' July 2, 1936&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''1941:''' The United States declares war on Japan, and many Tomahawk young men and women enlist in military and other service.
*'''1951:''' [[Einar Ingman]] is awarded the Medal of Honor for valor in Korea.

'''New Holstein''' is a city in [[Calumet County, Wisconsin|Calumet County]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Wisconsin]]. The population was 3,236 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. The city is located within the [[New Holstein, Calumet County, Wisconsin|Town of New Holstein]].

==History==
New Holstein is named after the [[Schleswig]]-[[Holstein]] region in [[Germany]] from which many early settlers emigrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4196/is_20041121/ai_n11002961/pg_2 }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1848, 70 people from [[Hamburg]], Germany emigrated to the New Holstein area,&lt;ref name=NHHS169&gt;Pioneer's Corner, p 169&lt;/ref&gt; forming the basis of what would become the present city. Many settlers were intellectuals who feared an impending war as a result of competing claims to the territory.&lt;ref&gt;Pioneer's Corner, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; Settlers originally named the community Altona after [[Altona, Hamburg]], Germany.&lt;ref name=NHHS57&gt;Pioneer's Corner, p. 57-58&lt;/ref&gt; As the amount of mail received in Altona increased, the United States Post Office wanted Altona to be renamed because the community's name was too close to [[Altoona, Wisconsin|Altoona]] in western Wisconsin.&lt;ref name=NHHS57 /&gt;

In the early years, settlers traveled for supplies to [[Calumetville, Wisconsin]], a larger neighboring community.&lt;ref name=NHHS6&gt;{{cite book | title=Pioneer's Corner | author= New Holstein Historical Society | page = 6 |accessdate = February 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wild game, such as [[passenger pigeon]]s, was available for food.&lt;ref name=NHHS6 /&gt;

The first settlers in the city were Charles Greening and two of his companions.&lt;ref name=ChiltonTimesJournal12272007&gt;{{cite news |title=Looking Back/Calumet County History - 1881 |work=[[Chilton Times-Journal]] |date=2007-12-27 |accessdate=2008-01-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Charles Bock arrived shortly afterwards. The first [[postmaster]] was [[Monsignor]] Puchner, a [[Roman Catholic]] priest. In 1849 the town was organized, with the first chairman being Greening,&lt;ref name=ChiltonTimesJournal12272007 /&gt; who was named county judge in 1855. Settlers continued arriving from Germany throughout the mid-nineteenth century. A drama troupe was organized in 1851.&lt;ref name=ChiltonTimesJournal12272007 /&gt;

Railroad service was planned at meetings in 1871. A depot was built and the railroad arrived in 1872.&lt;ref&gt;Pioneer's Corner, pp. 12-13&lt;/ref&gt; The railroad named the station &quot;New Holstein&quot; after the town.&lt;ref name=NHHS57 /&gt; Mail then came to the community on trains instead of via the [[Pony Express]]. The first post office was built shortly after rail service started.&lt;ref name=NHHS57 /&gt;

By 1881, the community comprised about 400 residents, all of whom were either Germans or of German descent.&lt;ref name=ChiltonTimesJournal12272007 /&gt; The village covered over one square mile.&lt;ref name=ChiltonTimesJournal12272007 /&gt; That year it had two public halls, three hotels, a fire insurance company, and a cemetery. New Holstein's principal business was a flour mill.&lt;ref name=ChiltonTimesJournal12272007 /&gt; Near the train [[train station|depot]] was a grain elevator owned by [[Herman C. Timm House|Herman Timm]].

In 1900 the census reported a population of 569.&lt;ref name=NHHS169 /&gt; New Holstein was incorporated as a village the following year. The first lights were installed in the city in 1912.&lt;ref name=NHHS169 /&gt;

New Holstein became a city in April 1926.&lt;ref name=NHHS10&gt;Pioneer's Corner, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; The first city council was: Mayor Edward Funke, City Clerk Harvey C. Hansen, City Council President Peter Hass, Aldermen Gilbert Hipke, Robert Schilling, Louie Schaar, Edgar Lange, W. W. Lauson, Henry Schmidt, and Harry C. Hass, Superintendent of Water Works Henry Aggen, Fire Chief Walter Mathes, Assessor Arthur Roehl,and City Attorney George M. Goggins.&lt;ref name=NHHS10 /&gt;

==Education==
Markesan School District consists of Markesan Elementary, Middle and High Schools. The Middle and High Schools are joined, while the Elementary School is located approximately half a mile to the south. The school district once consisted of a central high school, central middle/elementary school, and two satellite locations housing half of the grades 1 through 4 in [[Mackford, Wisconsin|Mackford]] Prairie and [[Manchester, Green Lake County, Wisconsin|Manchester]]. In 1999 a new high school building was constructed adjacent the existing high school building. When the new high school opened, the middle school was moved to the old high school building and the elementary schools were consolidated into the former elementary/middle school building. Until the late 1970s, satellite locations in [[Dalton, Wisconsin|Dalton]], [[Marquette, Wisconsin|Marquette]], [[Kingston, Wisconsin|Kingston]], and [[Fairwater, Wisconsin|Fairwater]] also existed.
The school mascot is the hornet and the school song is the Notre Dame Victory March.  The school colors are navy and gold.

Author unknown. &quot;[http://www.clark-cty-wi.org/clarkhistory.htm The Heart of Wisconsin]&quot;, 1900 (estimated).&lt;/ref&gt;

The first settlers of European descent in the area were [[James O'Neill (Wisconsin settler)|James O'Neill]] and his party, who arrived around 1845, looking for a location to build a [[sawmill]] along the [[Black River (Wisconsin)|Black River]]. The city was named in honor of O'Neill, as was O'Neill Creek, which runs through the center of the city and drains into the Black River.

In 1854, O’Neill’s Mill, as Neillsville was originally called, was selected as the county seat of [[Clark County, Wisconsin|Clark County]].&lt;ref&gt;MacBridge, R. J. &quot;[http://wvls.lib.wi.us/ClarkCounty/clark/history/1909History/3.htm The History of Clark County]&quot;, Thorp Courier, 1909-06-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Neillsville was [[plat]]ted on April 14, 1855 and [[Municipal corporation|incorporated]] in April 1882.&lt;ref&gt;Clark County, WI Internet Library Project. &quot;[http://wvls.lib.wi.us/ClarkCounty/pinevalley/index.htm Pine Valley Township, Clark County, Wisconsin]&quot;. Retrieved on 2007-10-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Neillsville is where noted architect [[William L. Steele]] died. Poor health had forced Steele to retire from architecture in late 1946, leaving his eldest son William L. Steele, Jr. and partner Josiah D. Sandham in charge of the practice. Steele had come to Neillsville to live with one of his daughters, Sallie (Mrs. Thomas S. Noble, Jr.), and died at her house on March 4, 1949.&lt;ref name=&quot;Steele Obituary&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usgennet.org/usa/wi/county/clark/clark/data/2/bbs50/50275.htm |title=Obituary William LaBarthe Steele (1875 – 1949) |date=March 10, 1949 |work=Clark County Press |location=Neillsville, Clark County, Wisconsin }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Withey 1956 p569&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Withey |first1=Henry F |authorlink1= |last2=Withey |first2=Elsie Rathburn |authorlink2= |title=Biographical Dictionary of American Architects (Deceased) |year=1956 |publisher=New Age Publishing Co |location=Los Angeles |page=569 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neillsville is featured in 1995 comedy movie ''[[Tommy Boy]]'' featuring [[Chris Farley]] and [[David Spade]]. When Paul (Rob Lowe), Tommy's Stepbrother, changes the orders in the shipping computer he changes the order for Nelson Automotive located in Neillsville, Wisconsin. He changes the order from overnight delivery to 2 week delivery. This eventually leads to the downfall of the family owned Callahan auto business which forces Tommy Callahan III (Chris Farley) to take drastic measures. It is also rumored that Neillsville pops up in the deleted scenes of the movie.

==History==
Elroy was for many years an important railroad hub in the area. The Baraboo Air Line reached Elroy in the 1870s. The Air Line was later acquired by the [[Chicago and North Western Railway]] and the line was pushed on to [[Sparta, Wisconsin]]. It eventually became the main line of the CNW between [[Chicago, Illinois]] and [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]]. The [[Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis and Omaha Railway]] also became a presence in Elroy when its line was built south from [[Camp Douglas, Wisconsin]]. Both railroad companies kept roundhouses and other operations in Elroy.  Rail traffic on the Elroy portion of the CNW eventually declined, due to the construction of better mainline trackage further to the north (via [[Adams, Wisconsin|Adams]], [[Necedah, Wisconsin|Necedah]], and [[Wyeville, Wisconsin|Wyeville]]). The rails on this portion were taken up in the mid-1960s and the right-of-way was converted into the Elroy-Sparta Bike Trail, as it remains today. The CNW tracks from Elroy southeast to [[Reedsburg, Wisconsin]], along with those of the north-south Omaha line, were taken up in the 1990s, and these rights-of-way are now known as the &quot;400&quot; State Trail, and the Omaha Trail, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elroywi.com/history.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brodhead''' is a city in [[Green County, Wisconsin|Green]] and [[Rock County, Wisconsin|Rock]] counties in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Wisconsin]]. The population was 3,293 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. Of this, 3,203 were in Green County, and only 90 were in Rock County. In February 2000, the city annexed a portion of land from the [[Spring Valley (town), Wisconsin|Town of Spring Valley]] in [[Rock County, Wisconsin|Rock County]].

==History==
Just south of town is a historic marker for the Half-Way Tree, a [[bur oak]] supposedly identified by Native Americans as the halfway point on a foot trail between [[Lake Michigan]] and the [[Mississippi River]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=212640 JS Online: Don't look too closely at Half-Way Tree's roots&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The railroad track that runs east and west thru town features a small museum with a train and army tank on display, adjacent to the park and bandstand pavilion. The museum curator said that the railroad was being wooed by two different towns and decided to split the difference and created Brodhead.  A nearby branch of the Sugar River was diverted along a canal to a small hydroelectric generator supplied by a small holding pond. This supposedly gave Brodhead the distinction of having electrical service before other larger cities such as Chicago, and perhaps the first electrical service in Wisconsin.&lt;ref&gt;Contact the Brodhead Museum and Historical Society for details and verification.&lt;/ref&gt;

The area is popular for fishermen and boaters, since it provides several public docks allowing access to the Mississippi River, which widens to roughly three miles when it reaches Buffalo City.  There are a large number of sandy islands in the river that allow people to camp without permits.

In the winter months, snowmobiling and ice fishing are popular activities with local residents.

'''Cumberland''' is a city in [[Barron County, Wisconsin|Barron County]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Wisconsin]]. The population was 2,170 at the 2010 census. The city is located partially within the [[Cumberland, Barron County, Wisconsin|Town of Cumberland]]. It was incorporated in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;http:////www.city-data.com/city/Cumberland-Wisconsin.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Cumberland is often called the “Island City” and the main part of the city, including the original settlement, is located on land surrounded by Beaver Dam Lake, originally settled by Chippewa Indian Tribe.  Beaver Dam Lake was referred to as Che-wa-cum-ma-towangok or “Lake Made by the Beavers,” by the local tribe. The Chief of the Chippewa Tribe was Pon-gee Rau-gen, or “Little Pipe”. He continued to live in the area even after it was settled by European settlers and drowned in a canoe on Beaver Dam Lake in 1895.  In 1874, A. Ritan and R. H. Clothier explored the area with the intention of settling in there. While exploring, the came across surveyors that informed them of the upcoming railroad line that the North Wisconsin Railway Company planned to lay in the area. A. Ritan, who lived near what is today [[Turtle Lake, Wisconsin|Turtle Lake]] and the Dahlby Family, originally of Norwegian decent, from the town of [[New Richmond, Wisconsin|New Richmond]], both filed a homestead near the proposed railroad and built two log cabins, 300 feet north of the present high school location. In 1878, the North Wisconsin Railroad Company extended the rail lines through the area. Prior to the railroad, settlers were required to get provisions in [[Rice Lake (town), Wisconsin|Rice Lake]], [[Barron (town), Wisconsin|Barron]] or [[Clayton (town), Wisconsin|Clayton]]. In 1880, the Dahlby Family sold their cabin and moved to Chandler (now known as [[Spooner (town), Wisconsin|Spooner]]) and open a store. A. Ritan, also originally from Norway, lived in Cumberland for many years and helped develop the city before moving to [[Portland, Oregon]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pub1922&quot;&gt;Newton S. Gordon and Franklyn Curtiss-Wedge. ''History of Barron County, Wisconsin''. Minneapolis, Minn.: H.C. Cooper, 1922, pp. 1087-1101.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
R. H. Clothier also took a homestead and built a farm in 1875. On December 30, 1875 the town of Lakeside was organized, encompassing what is now Lakeland Township, Almena Township, Crystal Lake Township and Maple Plain Township. During the winter of 1876 a bridge, called Bonett Bridge, was built off the island and soon after a school was located on the mainland area near the bridge with Miss Ida Schofield as the original teacher.  She was soon replaced by Miss Carrie Fay, who arrived from nearby [[Prairie Farm]]. On January 1, 1880, the name was changed to Cumberland at the request of John Humbird, who arrived in the area from [[Cumberland, Maryland]]. Almena Township joined with the Turtle Lake Township a couple of months later and on November 12, 1902 Crystal Lake became their own Township. In early 1876 a post office, originally called Lakeland, was established three miles east of the city with L.I. Gunderson being named postmaster. On September 10, 1876, Mae Jenet Hodgkin became the first white person born on the island. The first grocery store was opened by David Ingle and Elmer Wisner of Clear Lake opened the first blacksmith shop in 1878. In the winter of 1879 the name was changed to Cumberland. In July of 1880, Dr. William Hopkins arrived from Maine and set up a practice. At the time, it was the only practice between Clear Lake, Wisconsin and Lake Superior. Also, around this time, a steam sawmill was set up in northern Cumberland, in what is now the “Mill Hill” area and operated for a few years until it was destroyed by fire on August 15, 1884. The Lakeside Cemetery was established in 1880. In 1881, the first newspaper, the ''Cumberland Herald'' (later the ''Cumberland Advocate'') began printing. The first bank, the Bank of Cumberland, began operation on October 8, 1883. After the railroad begin to operate, settlers quickly arrived in the area and by 1884 there were 24 saloons located in the area. In 1885 a jail and fire department, with N. D. Richards named the Fire Chief, were established and by the late 1880’s the first hotel was kept by Jack Collingwood, followed by several other hotels. Soon the Elm Street Bridge was completed and the Fire Department moved from their Lake Street location to their present location. In February of 1893, the state board of health sent a representative to set up a quarantine on the Italian settlement due to unsanitary conditions.  On August 1, 1884 the city borrowed $5,900 via bond issue to establish a system of waterworks which was constructed by [[Fairbanks, Morse and Company]] in February of 1895. In April of the same year, telephone lines were also erected in the city limits. On September 14, 1895, the newly built water tank burst and damaged several nearby properties. On November 20, 1897 the city approved a resolution to for street lighting of all public grounds by electricity. In 1903 the Uecke’s Opera House was opened and still remains today as an apartment complex.  The same year, a large school was constructed on the island on the present location of the Cumberland Elementary School. On March 15, 1905 a $10,000 donation from [[Andrew Carnegie]] established a Carnegie Library in Cumberland. In 1914 the Island City Hospital was created by Dr. George Grinde and included a 20 bed hospital and X-ray facilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;pub1922&quot;/&gt;

==History==
The city was founded at the intersection of the [[Minneapolis, St. Paul and Sault Ste. Marie Railroad]] (Soo&amp;nbsp;Line) with the [[Flambeau River]] in 1885, as &quot;Flambeau Falls&quot; after the [[Ojibwa]] name for the area ''Gakaabikijiwanan'' (&quot;of cliffed rapids&quot;).  Robert Corbett, a logging and lumbering entrepreneur, held the dominant influence on city in its early years, first renamed as &quot;Corbett&quot;, then to &quot;Warner&quot; in 1891, and then to the present name on July&amp;nbsp;1, 1900, after the bride of Charles R. Smith, head of the Menasha Wooden Ware Co.

===2002 tornado===
On September 2, 2002, a [[tornado]] rated at [[Fujita scale|F3 strength]] destroyed much of Ladysmith's downtown area. The tornado touched down approximately at 4:20&amp;nbsp;pm CDT about one and one half miles (2&amp;nbsp;km) west southwest of downtown Ladysmith. The tornado was initially ranked an F0, but strengthened to an F2 at the intersection of highways 8 and 27 on the west side of town. The tornado further intensified to F3 just east of the railroad tracks near the Baptist church, and proceeded to tear up the downtown business area. The tornado remained at F3&amp;nbsp;strength for about a mile, before weakening to a F1 as it exited the east side of town. 

The tornado remained on the ground for about 15 miles (25&amp;nbsp;km) and moved at about {{convert|30|mph|-1|abbr=on}}. The tornado was one quarter of a mile wide (400&amp;nbsp;m) at its widest point. It finally lifted off around 4:50&amp;nbsp;pm CDT, about two miles south of the [[Ingram, Wisconsin|village of Ingram]]. Overall damage was estimated at $20&amp;nbsp;million (USD), but there were no fatalities.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.usatoday.com/weather/news/2002/2002-09-03-wisconsintornado_x.htm USA Today] &lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Ladysmith is the former home of [[Mount Senario College]], which closed in 2002 due to significant debt. In the 2006-2007 school year, part of the former campus was operated as Concordia Preparatory School, a private Christian high school. That institution also faced financial problems and closed. [[Silver Lake College]] of [[Manitowoc, Wisconsin]] began offering courses at Mount Senario, renamed &quot;Mount Senario Education Center&quot;, beginning September, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mountsenario.com/ Silver Lake College: Mount Senario Education Center's website]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flambeau Mine===
The Flambeau Copper Mine was operated by [[Kennecott (mining company)|Kennecott]] from 1993 to 1997. This was a very rich [[volcanogenic massive sulfide ore deposit]], so rich that the ore was shipped directly to the [[smelter]].

Mining in Wisconsin was very controversial. Several nearby deposits were discovered, but remain unexploited. Flambeau has since been permanently closed and the site reclaimed.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.mindat.org/loc-4496.html Flambeau Mine] at [[Mindat.org]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The population was 4,258 at the 2010 census, making it the second-largest city in the county after [[River Falls, Wisconsin|River Falls]], and the largest entirely within Pierce County.

Prescott was home to the mother house of the [[Franciscan Servants of Jesus]]. The town was first settled by (and named for) [[Philander Prescott]], who opened a trading post there in 1839.

==Geography==
Prescott is located at {{coord|44|45|6|N|92|47|35|W|type:city}} (44.751567, -92.793141).{{GR|1}} It is the westernmost incorporated community in Wisconsin, although rural portions of [[Burnett County, WI|Burnett]] and [[Polk County, WI|Polk]] counties are further west. Prescott, along with the rest of Pierce County, is officially a part of the [[Minneapolis-St. Paul|Minneapolis-St Paul-Bloomington MN-WI]] [[Metropolitan Statistical Area]].

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|2.96|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which, {{convert|2.59|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.37|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.&lt;ref name =&quot;Gazetteer files&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Darlington''' is a [[city]] in and the [[county seat]] of [[Lafayette County, Wisconsin|Lafayette County]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Wisconsin]]. The population was 2,451 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].{{GR|8}} The city is surrounded by the [[Darlington (town), Wisconsin|Town of Darlington]].

==History==
The first white man’s residence within the city limits of Darlington was a log house owned by Jamison Hamilton in 1836. He laid out the village of Avon, or Centre, in 1847.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref6&quot;&gt;Western Historical Company. History of Lafayette County. Chicago: Windmill Publications, 1881.&lt;/ref&gt; Darlington was first organized in 1849, but was known for a long time as the town of Centre. The first town meeting was held on April 3, 1849, with 82 votes being cast.

The first store was built in 1848. Two more were started in 1851, a millinery shop run by Miss Graham and a store run by Mr. Driver. The first hardware store was opened in 1852 by the Willett Brothers, and the first drug store was opened by J. Collins and Dr. Blair, who was the first resident physician in the city. The first school was opened in the winter of 1850, with 15 students.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref4&quot;&gt;Darlington History. Wisconsin Historical Society. 6 Oct. 2008. &lt;http://www.wisconsinhistory.org&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  The first religious services were held some time in 1851 in the barn of Jamison Hamilton. The Mineral Point Railroad reached the town in the fall of 1856, and the citizens were very pleased that their dream of expanding their “village” was finally coming true.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref6&quot;/&gt;

In 1857, the county seat was moved from [[Shullsburg, Wisconsin|Shullsburg]] to Darlington, and the courthouse was built using county funds. The courthouse was also moved to Darlington in 1861, and in 1869 the town of Centre became known as Darlington.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref7&quot;&gt;Lafayette County Bicentennial Committee. ''The Lafayette County Bicentennial Book''. Madison: Straus Printing and Publishing, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; The name was changed because Joshua Darling purchased the land in 1850 with the help of J.M. Keep and J.B. Lynde.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref6&quot;/&gt; The survey of the original streets and blocks of the community took place in June 1850 by Josiah Richardson and H. H. Gray, assisted by an Indian named January.

The streets of the town were named after the wives of the planners and prominent men of the town, such as Minerva, Mary, Harriet, Lucy, Louisa, and Cornelia. “Minerva was the wife of James G. Knight, the first president of the village, and Mary was the wife of Josepheus Driver, one of the first businessmen of Darlington. Harriet was the wife of Hamilton Gray, and Lucy was the wife of William K. Jackman. Louisa was the wife of Isaah Stockwell, and Cornelia was the wife of James M. Keep, one of the original founders of the community.” He also aided Joshua Darling in the purchase of the land.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref7&quot;/&gt;

===The Ringling Brothers Circus and Darlington===
Alfred T. Ringling established himself in Darlington, Wisconsin at the age of 20, working as a harness maker in his own shop. He gave little shows for the students in schools and citizens of Darlington and the surrounding towns, with an act that included having four strong farmers lift up a plow, with Alfred lying beneath it. They positioned the plow so Alfred could balance it on his chin. It was a major crowd pleaser.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref11&quot;&gt;&quot;Ringling Show Had Start in Darlington.&quot; ''Milwaukee Journal'', 13 Dec. 1925.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Parson Brothers, Joe and Alfred E. &quot;Butch&quot; Parson, from Darlington were also interested in the circus. Joe Parson, the older of the two, worked in a lumber camp in the winter months in the 1870s. It was said that he bought a bison that he saw grazing in a field one spring when he was returning from the lumber camp. He made a deal with the farmer that owned it, and Joe gave the farmer his horse in exchange for the bison. Joe started showing his bison at carnivals and festivals, and he purchased a few more animals to form a show he called &quot;The Great Palace Show&quot;.  Alfred Ringling, or Al, worked in the Parson Brother’s show as a ropewalker in 1881 and most likely 1882.  He also worked in Parson’s “Great Grecian Show” in 1883.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref12&quot;&gt;Parson, Frank. Candy Stand Book, Ringling Bros.Show, Season of 1906. (Taken from the book ''Managing Two Big Shows: 1908-1909''.).&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Ringling Brothers (Alfred T., John, Charles, and Otto) were planning their own circus, they invited the Parson Brothers to join them in 1884.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref12&quot;&gt;Parson, Frank. Candy Stand Book, Ringling Bros.Show, Season of 1906. (Taken from the book ''Managing Two Big Shows: 1908-1909''.)&lt;/ref&gt; The Ringlings had their own band, with Al playing the bass drum, John the cornet, and Charles and Otto the trombone and tuba. John was the leader of their band.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref11&quot;/&gt; The Parsons joined the Ringlings in 1887. Joe Parson did horseback-riding stunts and also performed on the high wire. Butch Parson ran the concession wagon, selling items such as pink lemonade, peanuts, popcorn, Cracker Jacks, cigars, and paper fans. Butch managed the stand and paid a monthly sum to the Ringlings, hired his own help. The Ringlings stored and took care of his concession wagon for him.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref12&quot;/&gt;

Both sets of brothers worked well with each other for a time until the Ringling Brothers felt that the Parson Brothers were making more than them with the concession wagon. In 1906, the Parsons cleared around $30,000, for a 44% profit. The Ringlings wanted to run the concessions by themselves so they could clear more of a profit. Through a series of letters, Otto Ringling tried to sever the ties to the Parsons in December 1907. At first, the letters were formal, requesting that the Parsons allow the Ringlings to run the stand. By November 1908, Otto Ringling wrote to Butch Parson completely ending the relationship between the two families. In the letter, he said that the Ringlings could no longer store the concession wagon because of lack of space. Although their relationship with the Ringlings ended, the Parsons had become very wealthy from the concession wagon.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref12&quot;&gt;Parson, Frank. Candy Stand Book, Ringling Bros.Show, Season of 1906. (Taken from the book ''Managing Two Big Shows: 1908-1909''.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The settlement  Ahnapee which eventually became known as Algoma was founded in 1834 by Joseph McCormick of [[Manitowoc, Wisconsin|Manitowoc]]. In 1851, [[Ireland|Irish]] and [[England|English]] pioneers moved to the area and called the place ''Wolf River''. This was a loose translation from the Indian word An-Ne-Pe, meaning &quot;land of the great gray wolf.&quot;  The wolf was a legendary animal in stories told by the local [[Potawatomi]] Indians. (This animal eventually became the mascot of the Algoma High School [[Algoma School District]].)

In the mid-19th century, immigrants from Germany, [[Bohemia]], [[Scandinavia]], and [[Belgium]] settled in the community. The earliest businesses consisted of a sawmill, a general store, and churches. In 1859, the name of the town was changed from Wolf to ''Ahnapee.''&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Ahnapee, Town of.&quot; ''Dictionary of Wisconsin History'', http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&amp;term_id=6581&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ahnapee, Wisconsin|The town which surrounds Algoma]] still bears this name.

In 1871, the town survived the [[Peshtigo Fire]] that swept from [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]] and destroyed thousands of acres of land. Local residents were prepared to escape from the fire, but torrential rains extinguished it just before it reached Ahnapee.

Growth and development in Ahnapee was greatly advanced in 1892 with the arrival of the [[Ahnapee and Western Railway]], which connected the coastal town with the [[Kewaunee, Green Bay and Western Railroad|Kewaunee Green Bay and Western Railroad]] at [[Casco Junction, Wisconsin|Casco Junction]]. The railroad would connect Algoma with the rest of the nation's rail system for the 94 years. Several factories were built in Ahnapee as a result of the railroad's arrival, including the Ahnapee Seating &amp; Veneer Company. This industry would change owners and names through the years, but still operates in town as Algoma Hardwoods, Incorporated.

Ahnapee incorporated as a city on February 23, 1879.&lt;ref&gt;Laws of Wisconsin of 1879, Chapter 120&lt;/ref&gt; In 1897, the city was renamed ''Algoma'', a name which may have come from an Indian term for &quot;park of flowers.&quot; (See also [[Algoma (word)]])&lt;ref&gt;1929 Wisconsin Blue Book p. 629, http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/WI.WIBlueBk1929. The name was changed by action of the Wisconsin state legislature. As a result, the local newspaper also changed its name from the ''Ahnapee Record'' to the ''Algoma Record''.  [http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84024885 Library of Congress] Some sources have the name change taking place in 1879. (See, e.g., [http://www.algoma.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=12&amp;Itemid=27 The Algoma Chamber of Commerce])&lt;/ref&gt; At that time the commercial fishing fleet located in Algoma was the largest on Lake Michigan. Sport fishing is still a major tourist attraction today.

==Culture==
'''Shanty Days''' is an annual celebration held the second weekend of August. There are ethnic foods, [[music]], and [[beer]]. Features also include an arts and crafts show, a used-book sale, a [[parade]], a 5k run/walk, wine tasting, fireworks and a street fair.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.algoma.org/shanty-days/index.html Shanty days at Algoma.org&lt;/ref&gt;

The Concerts in the Park Series begins Wednesday evenings, following the Fourth of July and ends the Wednesday after Shanty Days.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.algoma.org/calendar/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; These concerts are sponsored by the city of Algoma and various local businesses. The performances are located at Heritage Park, next to the Algoma Marina.

==In popular culture==
*In &quot;[[Buried (Prison Break episode)|Buried]]&quot;, an episode of the television series ''[[Prison Break]]'', fugitive [[Haywire (Prison Break character)|Haywire]] enters a shop in Algoma and steals supplies from a crippled shopkeeper. The shopkeeper's dog, a [[border collie]], chases Haywire until he reaches the shore of Lake Michigan. There, he tells the dog that he will build a raft and sail across the water to get to [[Holland, MI|Holland]].
*In &quot;[[The Message (Prison Break episode)|The Message]]&quot;, an episode of the television series ''[[Prison Break]],'' [[Haywire (Prison Break character)|Haywire]] buys beer for two locals.

==Transportation==

===Roads===
Four lane [[Wisconsin Highway 23|Highway 23]] is the primary east-west route into the city. It lies just north of the city. [[Interstate 43]], located less than five miles east of Sheboygan Falls, is the primary north-south transportation route into the area. [[Wisconsin Highway 28|Highway 28]] is another primary east-west route into the city, and forms part of the south edge of the city. [[Wisconsin Highway 32|Highway 32]] is the primary north-south route into the city, and it routes through downtown Sheboygan Falls. Secondary county highways include Counties PP to the east and C to the west.

===Airport===
Sheboygan Falls is served by the [[Sheboygan County Memorial Airport]], which is located several miles from the city.

===Water===
The [[Sheboygan River]] snakes through Sheboygan Falls, and it's confluence with the [[Mullet River]] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mullet_River Onion River] occurs within the city limits. Rapids and the dam, which once supplied hydroelectric energy, prohibit most water transportation through the city.

===Rail===
A single-track railroad branch line between Plymouth and Sheboygan runs through the city. The track was originally built by the Chicago &amp; North Western (C&amp;NW) Railroad and paralleled the electric interurban Wisconsin Power &amp; Light &lt;ref&gt;&quot;Badger Traction,&quot; page 91 in particular and the chapter on the electric railroad operations of the WP&amp;L; Published by Central Electric Railfans' Association, 1969&lt;/ref&gt;line which terminated at Elkhart Lake.  In later years it was primarily a freight line served by the [[Chicago and North Western Transportation Company]], and later, [[Union Pacific Railroad|Union Pacific]] after UP acquired the C&amp;NW in 1995. In 2006, citing low demand and degraded infrastructure, Union Pacific announced plans to abandon the line west of the [[Kohler Company]] factory in [[Kohler, Wisconsin|Kohler]], thus terminating all service to Sheboygan Falls. In May 2009, the State of Wisconsin [[Wisconsin Department of Transportation|Department of Transportation]] finalized the purchase of the Plymouth-Sheboygan Falls portion of the line from Union Pacific, with the intent of repairing the long dormant line to allow the Wisconsin &amp; Southern Railroad to provide restored service to Sheboygan Falls.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sheboygan Press&quot;&gt;&quot;State: Rail line connecting Falls, Plymouth to go back in service&quot;, Sheboygan Press, May 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The track through downtown Sheboygan Falls has been of interest to [[railfan]]s because of a number of interesting features, including an iron trestle over the Sheboygan River, a small section of [[street running]] where the line runs at grade along city streets, and antiquated [[Wigwag (railroad)|&quot;wig-wag&quot;]] signals at several crossings. Many of these features have been threatened because of the Union Pacific's abandonment of the line; the trestle has been barricaded and parts of the tracks leading to it have been removed,&lt;ref name=&quot;WTMJ&quot;&gt;[http://www.todaystmj4.com/news/local/45624042.html Family Wants Barricades on Railroad Trestle], WTMJ-4 TV (Milwaukee), May 21, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and plans to restore the line for the resumption of service will require crossing signals to be upgraded. Wig wag signals have already been removed.

== History ==
In 1827, [[Henry Dodge]], his family, and about 40 miners began what would become the city of Dodgeville.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wlhn.org/wisconsonian/oct99/DodgevilleHistory.html|title=Dodgeville History|last=Johnson|first=Cindy|date=August 18, 1999|work=Wisconsin Local History Network|accessdate=2009-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dodge made a pact with the local [[Ho-Chunk|Winnebago]] Indian leaders so he could build a cabin and smelter. The original community was made up of three separate settlements: &quot;Dodgeville&quot;, &quot;Dirty Hollow&quot; and &quot;Minersville&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson&quot;/&gt;

Dodgeville, which was named after Henry Dodge, grew slowly during its early years. It became a village in the 1840s. Later a small &quot;war&quot; was fought with [[Mineral Point, Wisconsin|Mineral Point]] over which community would become the county seat of Iowa County. At the time, Mineral Point was the seat, but Dodgeville residents felt they should have it. Rumor has it that a few people from Mineral Point actually fired a cannon towards Dodgeville over the issue of the county seat.  Dodgeville eventually won the &quot;war&quot; and currently hosts the Iowa County seat in what is Wisconsin's oldest courthouse. Dodgeville then saw a population boom, and it became a powerhouse for mining. Miners from England flooded the city, and the area flourished. British and Cornish architecture is still visible in the city today. Dodgeville became the largest city in Wisconsin at the time as well as most of the Midwest north or St. Louis, and west of Cincinnati. The city's boom didn't last long though, and with the decline of mining the city was passed by rapidly growing cities like Chicago and Milwaukee.
Several factors led to the decline in importance of mining, including the [[Black Hawk War]], the [[California Gold Rush of 1849]], the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], and the emergence of farming, leading to Dodgeville's development as a business and agricultural center. Today the city is most commonly known for being the International Headquarters for the apparel company Lands' End. It also reels in tourists for its historical sites, festivals, and geographical location.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson&quot;/&gt;

=== Historical sites ===

The [http://www.iowacountyhistoricalsociety.org/ Iowa County Historical Society] restored the cabin and moved it to its present location on Fountain Street. It is one of Wisconsin's oldest structures and may be the last extant mining camp cabin from the days of the &quot;Lead Rush&quot; of 1827-1830.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

== Recreation ==

=== Military Ridge Trail ===

A daily or seasonal pass must be purchased by users.

=== Governor Dodge State Park ===
One of the largest state parks in Wisconsin, [[Governor Dodge State Park]] is located on Highway 23, about {{convert|3|mi|km}} north of Dodgeville. The park was named after [[Henry Dodge]], the first governor of the [[Wisconsin Territory|Territory of Wisconsin]]. The Military Ridge Trail leads directly into Governor Dodge Park. Set deep in the [[Driftless Area]] of Wisconsin, the park offers many scenic bluffs, steep hills, and wildlife. When it was donated to the state in 1948, the park contained only {{convert|160|acre|km2}}. It quickly grew to {{convert|5270|acre|km2}}.  Two lakes with beach and camping areas are located in Governor Dodge Park: Twin Valley Lake and Cox Hollow.

=== Events ===
Every summer Dodgeville holds a &quot;Farmer Appreciation Day&quot; featuring a parade down Dodgeville's Iowa Street and a festival in Harris Park. The event takes place the third weekend of July (n place of the Blues Fest) and serves as a way for the people of Dodgeville to show appreciation for the farmers who are the backbone of the economy. The parade features farming implements, fire trucks and ambulances, and more tractors and fire trucks from local departments, some more fire trucks and ambulances (along with some more farming equipment) and floats constructed by area churches and businesses. The festival features cold BBQ sandwiches, music, rides, tractor pulls, and fireworks.

The town at one time hosted an annual Blues Fest every July, in which local and national blues acts entertained. However it was decided in 2010 that due to the smugness of locals, that Blues Fest would not be held. But, it was announced in 2011 that the festival will continue. It is held in the back parking lot of the Iowa County Courthouse, located downtown. Blues Fest brings in hundreds of tourists each year, and contributes to the reason Dodgeville remains a touristy city.  However, in 2013, the Blues Fest was once again cancelled.  

Every August, Lands' End hosts a four-day clearance sale in the Harris Park pavilion, drawing visitors from far and wide in search of bargains on Lands' End products.

== The Dodgeville kangaroo incident ==
In the winter of 2005, a kangaroo mysteriously appeared hopping around in the snow on farmland just west of Dodgeville. The story was carried in news outlets throughout the country, including the ''Chicago Tribune'' and MSNBC. No one knew where the kangaroo had come from. A few days after the kangaroo first appeared, it was captured in a barn west of town and taken to the [[Henry Vilas Zoo]] in [[Madison, Wisconsin]]. Attempts to find the owner of the kangaroo were unsuccessful, and to this day no one has any idea who owned the kangaroo and how it turned up in the snows of southwestern Wisconsin. The kangaroo still resides at the Henry Vilas Zoo.

== Health ==
Located in the very south of the city of Dodgeville is Upland Hills Health Center,  Before the Center was created, the city had two main hospitals, St. Joseph's Hospital, and Dodgeville General Hospital. In 1974, those two hospitals merged to form Memorial Hospital and located where Upland Hills Health Center currently is. Subsequently, in 2001, Memorial Hospital changed its name to Upland Hills Health Center. After Upland Hills Health Center was established, other structures were added to the hospital, which were eventually demolished to build the much larger existing Upland Hills Health Center. The Center now comprises a clinic, rehabilitation center, nursing home, and large hospital, and is the largest hospital in southwestern Wisconsin, serving all of Iowa county.

== Transportation ==
[[Dodgeville Municipal Airport]] The Dodgeville Municipal airport was built between May–December 1967. It was originally known as the Governor Dodge Quinn airport but renamed to Dodgeville Airport. It was depicted as a public use airport. It was closed in 1989 for unknown reasons, but was reopened as a private airport.

'''Blair''' is a city in [[Trempealeau County, Wisconsin|Trempealeau County]], [[Wisconsin]], along the [[Trempealeau River]]. The population was 1,366 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].

Blair is on the former [[Green Bay and Western Railroad]], which ran down the Trempealeau River valley to [[Winona, Minnesota]].

==History==
The city was first settled during the 1850s. The majority of the city's population are descended from [[Norwegian people|Norwegian]] settlers, with a smaller group descended from [[Germans|German]] settlers. The city's Norwegian heritage is represented by annual [[lefse]] and [[lutefisk]] suppers at the churches and a love of [[Polka|polka music]]. A lefse company is located in Blair.&lt;ref&gt;[http://trempealeau.wigenweb.org/histories/1881norwis/blair.htm ''Blair History &amp; Biographical Sketches of Blair Residents'' (History of Northern Wisconsin, 1881)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The city's name was changed from Porterville in 1873 when the [[Green Bay and Western Railroad]] was routed through the city. The new name of Blair came from one of the railroad's chief investors, [[John Insley Blair]]. At one time, during the heyday of [[railroad]]s, a [[branch line]] connected the GB&amp;W with the nearby city of [[Ettrick, Wisconsin|Ettrick]] (although it was later abandoned). The railroad continues to operate, although under a different name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blairsociety.org/blplace.html#WISCONSIN '' A Place Called Blair'' (published in the &quot;Blair Family Magazine&quot; Spring 1993)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The city has avoided the fate of some small towns in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] which slowly lost population due to young people leaving for jobs elsewhere. The population of Blair nearly doubled in the years between 1950 and 2000. During the 1950s and earlier annual floods during the snow melt were often experienced, but better farming techniques now make flooding rare. More recently, a number of Amish farming families have settled in the area and their horse-drawn carriages are sometimes seen on the roads.

==Geography==
Blair is located at {{coord|44|17|42|N|91|13|48|W|type:city}} (44.294967, -91.230080).{{GR|1}} According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|1.24|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which, {{convert|1.15|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.09|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.&lt;ref name =&quot;Gazetteer files&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two highways connect to the city: Highway 53, a north-south route, and Highway 95, an east-west route. The closest large cities are [[Eau Claire, Wisconsin|Eau Claire]] to the north and [[La Crosse, Wisconsin|La Crosse]] to the south. [[Whitehall, Wisconsin|Whitehall]], the county seat, is seven miles away. The rural area surrounding Blair is in the Town of Preston. Nearby communities include [[Taylor, Wisconsin|Taylor]], [[Arcadia, Wisconsin|Arcadia]], [[Independence, Wisconsin|Independence]], [[Hixton, Wisconsin|Hixton]], and [[Galesville, Wisconsin|Galesville]].

The [[Trempealeau River]] near Blair was dammed to create Lake Henry, named after one of the first settlers.

Blair is in the [[Driftless Area]], which was undisturbed by the last great glacial flow over North America. The area is also known as the Coulee Region, characterized by rolling hills. The forested hills are favored by deer hunters. Pheasants and grouse are also hunted. Local streams are fished for [[trout]], which are stocked.

'''Viroqua''' is the [[county seat]] of [[Vernon County, Wisconsin|Vernon County]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States]]. The population was 5,079 at the 2010 census. The city is located within the [[Viroqua (town), Wisconsin|Town of Viroqua]].

==History==
The Native American [[Ho-Chunk]] inhabited the area now known as Vernon County and the area of Viroqua. The Ho-Chunk, formerly known as the Winnebago, are a [[Siouan]]-speaking people and lived in the western Great Lakes region for thousands of years. The Ho-Chunk were removed westward beginning in the 1820s.&lt;ref&gt;Loew, Patty. Indian Nations of Wisconsin: Histories of Endurance and Renewal. Madison: Wisconsin Historical Society press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a sharp rivalry between Viroqua and [[Springville, Vernon County, Wisconsin|Springville]] to be named the county seat of Vernon County. A deed for {{convert|40|acre|m2}} of land was promised by pioneer Moses Decker, on condition that Viroqua be chosen as the county seat. The land constituted what became known as the County Addition to the city of Viroqua.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.viroqua-wisconsin.com/about/history.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

Decker was one of the early settlers in the area. He arrived in 1847 and laid out the village of Viroqua. He died in 1860.&lt;ref&gt;History of Vernon County, Wisconsin. Springfield, IL: Union Publishing Company, 1884.&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier settlers arrived in 1844 and built lumber mills on the Kickapoo River. Farmers began arriving in 1846, some of whom were John Graham, T.J. Defreese and William C. McMichael.&lt;ref&gt;Bierce, B.C. &quot;Industry of Bad Ax County&quot; in Transactions of the Wisconsin State Agricultural Society, volume VI. Madison, WI: Smith &amp; Cullaton. 1860.&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1851, the act authorizing the organization of Bad Axe, now Vernon County, was approved by Governor [[Nelson Dewey]]. Viroqua was awarded the county seat, pending a permanent location to be determined by a vote. In May 1852, residents voted in favor of Viroqua.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&amp;term_id=35&amp;keyword=bad+axe&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 28, 1865, Viroqua was [[1865 Viroqua, Wisconsin tornado|hit by a deadly tornado]] that left 22 dead.

== Economy and revitalization ==
Viroqua was dubbed &quot;The Town That Beat [[Walmart]]&quot; by ''[[Smithsonian Magazine]]'' in 1992 because it fostered businesses that co-exist with the retail giant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/news/specials/walmart/|title=Wal-Mart's Social and Economic Impact|author=NPR|accessdate=2009-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city promoted small business development through several state and federal programs.

Viroqua is a Wisconsin Main Street City and its downtown is listed on the Wisconsin and [[National Register of Historic Places]].

The Temple Theatre is an example of the town's resurgence.  The US$1.6 million restoration of the 1922 [[classical revival]] style [[vaudeville]] and movie theater was driven by volunteers.  The building now serves as an arts and cultural center for the surrounding counties.

== Transportation ==
Viroqua is located at the intersection of [[U.S. Route 14|U.S. Highway 14]], [[U.S. Route 61|U.S. Highway 61]], [[Wisconsin Highway 27]], [[Wisconsin Highway 56]], and [[Wisconsin Highway 82]].

Recently, the highways and major streets in Viroqua were redone.  Highways 14, 61, and 27 had lanes added to them to become four lanes, except for the four block section of downtown. That was kept two lanes to allow for parallel parking on the side of the road.

Viroqua was on the new airways route between [[La Crosse, Wisconsin|La Crosse]], Wisconsin, and [[Rockford, Illinois|Rockford]], [[Illinois]], when it was established in June 1932.  The beacon light had about fifteen large {{convert|36|in|mm|adj=on}} revolving beacons of 2,000,000 [[candle power]] when it was installed on the Mahlon Lepley farm, four miles (6&amp;nbsp;km) northeast of Viroqua.

'''Delavan''' is a city in [[Walworth County, Wisconsin|Walworth County]], Wisconsin, United States. The population was 8,463 at the 2010 census. The city is located partially within the [[Delavan (town), Wisconsin|Town of Delavan]] but the two entities are politically independent.

==History==
Delavan sits in the middle of what was at one time an inland sea. During the [[last glacial maximum|last Ice Age]], many glaciers, the last of which was known as the Michigan tongue, covered this area. The Michigan tongue descended what is now known as Lake Michigan. A large section of this glacier broke off, pushing southwest into the area now known as Walworth County. Geologists have called this section of the glacier &quot;the Delavan lobe&quot;.

The first humans known to inhabit the Delavan area were Native Americans around the era of 1000 BC. Later, between 500-1000 AD, Mound Builders lived in what is now the Delavan Lake area. Mound Builders were of the Woodland culture. The effigy mounds they erected along the shores of Delavan Lake numbered well over 200, according to an archeological survey done in the late 19th century by Beloit College. Many were along the north shore of the lake where Lake Lawn Resort now stands. The Potawotomi Indians also settled around the lake in the late 18th century, although there were only an estimated 240 in the county. Some of their burial mounds are preserved in what is now Assembly Park. 

From the mid-17th century through the mid-18th century, this area was of what was known as &quot;[[New France]]&quot; and was under the French flag. It came under British rule and a part of the Province of Quebec following the [[French and Indian War]]. In accordance with the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]], it was turned over to the United States and a part of the newly established [[Northwest Territory]]. 

Between the years of 1800 and 1836, the Delavan area was part of the [[Indiana Territory]], followed by the [[Illinois Territory]], finally becoming part of the [[Wisconsin Territory]] in 1836. Statehood was granted to Wisconsin in 1848. 

Delavan's first white settlers arrived in 1836, finding the area to be dense forests with prairies on both the east and west sides with plenty of game available for hunting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ci.delavan.wi.us/history.cfm History]&lt;/ref&gt; It was named after [[Edward C. Delevan]], [[temperance movement|temperance]] leader in [[Albany, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epodunk.com/cgi-bin/genInfo.php?locIndex=23926|title=Profile for Delavan, Wisconsin|publisher=[[ePodunk]]|accessdate=2010-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1847 and 1894, Delavan was home to 26 circus companies.&lt;ref&gt;Ginny Hall, &quot;[http://walworthcountytoday.com/weblogs/mystery-place/2012/mar/26/delavan-once-home-26-different-circus-families/ Delavan once home to 26 different circus families],&quot; ''Walworth County Today.&lt;/ref&gt; The Mabie Brothers U.S. Olympic Circus, then the largest in America, arrived in 1847, to become the first circus to quarter in the territory of Wisconsin. Its famous rogue elephant, &quot;Romeo&quot;, stood 19½ feet high, and weighed 10,500 pounds. The original [[Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus|P. T. Barnum Circus]] was organized here in 1871 by [[William Cameron Coup|William C. Coup]] and Dan Costello. Over 130 members of Delavan's 19th century circus colony are buried in Spring Grove and St. Andrew cemeteries.

On July 21, 1948, Delavan was the site of Wisconsin’s Circus Centennial as part of the state's celebration of 100 years of statehood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ruth-Marsicano|first=Patricia|title=Delavan|year=2004|publisher=Arcadia|location=Charleston, SC|isbn=9780738533117|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0Z04celqJVoC&amp;pg=PA71#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On May 2, 1966, Delavan was selected by the U.S. Post Office to issue on a first day cover basis, the five-cent American Circus commemorative postage stamp.

==History==
[[File:Elkhorn Wisconsin Downtown Looking East WIS11.jpg|thumb|right|Southern town square]]
In the early 19th century, Colonel Samuel Phoenix spotted a rack of elk antlers in a tree and proclaimed the area as &quot;Elk Horn.&quot;

The area's beauty and fertile soil lead Daniel Bradley, his brother Milo, and LeGrand Rockwell to create a community in the area. Its growth to a population of 539 led to the first town meeting in 1846. Elkhorn was designated county seat that same year because of its location in Walworth County.

In 1851, Elkhorn became the location of the Walworth County Fair, which is now hosted annually at the [[Walworth County Fairgrounds]]. The Walworth County Fair is the largest in Wisconsin after the Wisconsin State Fair,

Because the city places Christmas decorations around its center, Elkhorn has been called the &quot;Christmas Card Town&quot; since before World War II. This tradition is celebrated every year by an annual oil painting by local artist Jan Castle Reed. These watercolor paintings are turned into Christmas cards.&lt;ref&gt;http://cityofelkhorn.org/Community/History.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transportation ==
Elkhorn was a stop on the Racine &amp; Southwestern branch line of the [[Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad]], better known as the Milwaukee Road. In its 1980 bankruptcy, the Milwaukee Road disposed of the Southwestern Line. The Wisconsin &amp; Southern continues to service Elkhorn from a connection at Bardwell to the west.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glenviewcreek.com/elkhorn.html Elkhorn Railroad History and Photos]&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, the lines were absorbed by the [[Chicago &amp; North Western Railroad]]. Passenger service ended in the early 1960s under the CNW ownership. In 1992, the [[Wisconsin Great Northern Railroad]] was incorporated, to serve as a freight hauler from Spooner to [[Trego, Wisconsin|Trego]], a nearby town, with a connection to the CNW. Although the freight idea didn't work out, they began operating successful passenger excursion trains in 1997 (following the example of the nearby [[Duluth &amp; Northern Minnesota Railroad]] which began passenger excursions in Duluth only a few years before), and were an instant success. The passenger trains were very successful, and after the 1995 takeover of the CNW by the Union Pacific, UP in 1998 announced intentions to abandon the line from Hayward Junction where it connected to the [[Wisconsin Central Ltd.|Wisconsin Central]] {{convert|13|mi|km}} to the north through Spooner all of the way down to [[Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin|Chippewa Falls]]. The company bought the portion of the line between Spooner and Hayward Jct in 1999, which greatly expanded passenger operations. To this day they run very popular robbery, western style, cowboy, and buffet style as well as more formal dinner trains. More recently, the Great Pumpkin train nearly sold out and now runs annually around the time of [[Halloween]].&lt;ref&gt;http://spoonertrainride.com/PPages/The_Story_PPage.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://spoonertrainride.com/PPages/history_of_the_line_ppage.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://spoonertrainride.com/&lt;/ref&gt; The old CNW Spooner Railroad Depot now serves as the town's Railroad Memories Museum.

'''Berlin''' is a city in [[Green Lake County, Wisconsin|Green Lake]] and [[Waushara County, Wisconsin|Waushara]] counties in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Wisconsin]]. The population was 5,524 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. Of this, 5,435 were in Green Lake County, and only 89 were in Waushara County. The city is located mostly within the [[Berlin, Green Lake County, Wisconsin|Town of Berlin]] in Green Lake County, with a small portion extending into the [[Aurora, Waushara County, Wisconsin|Town of Aurora]] in Waushara County.

==History==
In 1845, Nathan H. Strong became the first resident of what is today Berlin. He was joined by Hugh G. Martin, Hiram Barnes, and William Dickey. Their settlement was known as Strong's Landing. In 1848 a post office was established. It was named [[Berlin]] after the capital of Prussia, now the capital of [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/wlhba/articleView.asp?pg=1&amp;orderby=&amp;id=5067&amp;pn=1&amp;adv=yes&amp;hdl=&amp;np=&amp;ln=&amp;fn=&amp;q=&amp;y1=&amp;y2=&amp;ci=berlin&amp;co=&amp;mhd=&amp;shd= &quot;Early History&quot;], ''Berlin'' (Wis.) ''Courant'', January 26, 1905.&lt;/ref&gt; The first school house was built in 1850 and the first church in 1851. Berlin was incorporated as a city in 1857.

===Pronunciation===
Area residents put the accent on the first syllable of Berlin {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɜr|l|ɪ|n}} rather than on the second. It has been said that this was in reaction to the [[anti-German sentiment]] that swept across the United States during [[World War I]], and that the accent was previously on the second syllable.&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell, Brandt. 2006.

==History==
Monona was originally part of the Town of Blooming Grove.  It was incorporated as a Village on August 29, 1938.  Prior to 1938, the area mainly consisted of farmland and summer homes.  However, by 1938, permanent homes and small businesses became much more common in the area.

During the 1950s, the Village of Monona grew from 2,544 to 8,178.  This population increase was the largest percentage increase (231%) of any other community in the State of Wisconsin during the decade.

Due to the population increase, the Monona facilities and services was greatly expanded.  In 1963, Monona built a community center and adjacent swimming pool.  In 1967, a public library was built.  In 1969, Monona changed to city status and built a City Hall  across from the library.  This building ended up housing all City operations (including the fire and police departments).

During the 1960s, commercial development significantly increased, especially along Monona Drive.
 
In the 1960s and 1970s, many properties were annexed by the city for residential, commercial and industrial purposes and is now surrounded by the City of Madison and by bodies of water.&lt;ref name=&quot;city-monona_about&quot;&gt;[http://www.mymonona.com/pages/about/history/ City of Monona: About Monona &gt; History&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indian mound discovery==

During the 1940s, a mound was unintentionally cut into during street construction and skeletons were uncovered.  This Indian burial mound was thought to have been built around 1,500 years ago by the Hopewell Indians. At the time the find was declared by the State Historical Society to be one of the most important archaeological discoveries ever made in southern Wisconsin. A State of Wisconsin historical marker was placed at this site in 1998, inscribed with the following:

The [[Outlet Mound]]

“The largest of 19 conical, oval and linear mounds once located in this vicinity, the Outlet Mound was built by Woodland Indians about 2,000 years ago. Constructed as a burial place, the mound was saved from destruction by the Wisconsin Archeological Society and local citizens in 1944 and donated to the City of Monona.”

The area where the mound was discovered became known as Indian Mounds Park.  It is located at the corner of Midwood and Ridgewood Avenues.&lt;ref name=&quot;city-monona_IndianMoundsPark&quot;&gt;[http://www.mymonona.com/pages/parks_recreation/parks_open_space/details.php/49/parks_open_space/indian%2Bmounds%2Bpark City of Monona: Parks &amp; Recreation &gt; Parks &amp; Open Spaces &gt; Indian Mounds Park&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://landmarkhunter.com/180235-outlet-mound/ LandmarkHunter.com | Outlet Mound&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oak Creek''' is a city in [[Milwaukee County, Wisconsin|Milwaukee County]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States]].

==History==
On January 2, 1838, the [[Wisconsin Territory|territorial legislature]] divided Milwaukee County into two [[civil township]]s: the [[Milwaukee (town), Wisconsin|Town of Milwaukee]], encompassing everything north of the present Greenfield Avenue, and the [[Lake, Milwaukee County, Wisconsin|Town of Lake]] encompassing everything south of the present Greenfield Avenue; &quot;and the polls of election shall be opened at the house of Elisha Higgins, in said town.&quot; On March 8, 1839, a new Town of Kinnikennick was created, encompassing the western part of Lake (later the Towns of [[Greenfield, Wisconsin|Greenfield]] and [[Franklin, Milwaukee County, Wisconsin|Franklin]]); and on August 13, 1840, the south portion of the Town of Lake was split off to form the town of Oak Creek. As of the 1840 [[United States Census|census]], the population of the Town of Lake (then including Oak Creek) was 418.&lt;ref&gt;Watrous, Jerome Anthony.

In 1955, the Town of Oak Creek, then still semi-rural with a population of 4807 in the 1950 census, was incorporated as a city under the terms of Wisconsin statute 66.0215, also known as &quot;The Oak Creek Law.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nxt.legis.state.wi.us/nxt/gateway.dll?f=templates&amp;fn=default.htm&amp;vid=WI:Default&amp;d=stats&amp;jd=66.0215 Wisconsin Legislature Data&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The Oak Creek Law was crafted by [[city attorney|Town Attorney]] Tony Basile to prevent Oak Creek's annexation by the City of [[Milwaukee]], which by annexations (including the 1954 annexation of the remainder of the Town of Lake) was now bordering Oak Creek and had already annexed one small portion of the town; and was shepherded through the legislature with the help of [[Wisconsin Democratic Party|state Democratic party legislative joint committee]] chairman [[Leland McParland]], who was the [[Wisconsin State Senate|state senator]] for Oak Creek.&lt;ref&gt;Cech, Jim.

==History==
In 1671 French Jesuit explorer Père [[Claude-Jean Allouez]] founded the [[St. Francis Xavier Mission]] at the last set of rapids on the [[Fox River (Wisconsin)|Fox River]] before entering [[Lake Michigan]]. The site was known as Rapides Des Pères (rapids of the fathers) which became modern day De Pere. 

Originally De Pere consisted of only the community on the east side of the river; however, in 1890 the City of West De Pere, on the west side of the river, consolidated with the city of De Pere to form one community.

[[St. Norbert College]], which abuts the banks of the Fox River on the city's west side near the [[Claude Allouez Bridge]], was founded by [[Norbertine]] Abbot Pennings in 1898.

'''Onalaska''' is a city in [[La Crosse County, Wisconsin]]. The population was 17,736 at the 2010 census.

Onalaska is built on a slightly elevated ridge above the Black River.  Natural areas include both river bottom land and high, heavily wooded, scenic [[Hill|bluffs]]. A man-made reservoir at the city's western edge is known as [[Lake Onalaska]]. Onalaska is known as &quot;The Sunfish Capital of the World.&quot;

== History ==
The original village (now city) was platted by Thomas G. Rowe (New York) and John C. Laird (Pennsylvania) in 1851. In its early days, lumbering and related industries served as a basis for its economy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyofonalaska.com/early_history.html circle alaska hotel tour airline at historyofonalaska.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The name for the city comes from the poem, &quot;The Pleasures of Hope&quot;, by the Scottish poet [[Thomas Campbell (poet)|Thomas Campbell]]. The original spelling of the name in Campbell's poem was &quot;Oonalaska&quot; (an Aleutian island and fishing village).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/the-pleasures-of-hope-excerpt |title=The Pleasures of Hope (excerpt) by Thomas Campbell |publisher=Poemhunter.com |date=2004-01-01 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other places named Onalaska are in [[Arkansas]] (now defunct), [[Onalaska, Texas|Texas]] and [[Onalaska, Washington|Washington]]; they are historically linked to one another through the lumber industry. In [[Alaska]], the modern day city of [[Unalaska, Alaska|Unalaska]] and [[Unalaska Island]] are linked to the Onalaskas through Thomas Campbell's poem. Unalaska is the original Oonalaska or Onalaska or &quot;Ounalashka&quot; (Russian spelling) immortalized by Campbell.

==Geography==
[[Image:Lake Onalaska, WI.jpg|thumb|right|Lake Onalaska]]
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|10.73|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which, {{convert|10.13|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.60|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.&lt;ref name =&quot;Gazetteer files&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Onalaska lies immediately north of [[La Crosse, Wisconsin]], on the Black River. It is the second largest city in [[La Crosse County]].

Named streams within the current corporate limits of the city include the [[Black River (Mississippi River)|Black River]], the [[La Crosse River]] and Sand Lake Coulee Creek. In the 1930s, the construction of [[Lake Onalaska]] resulted in the flooding and eventual disappearance of a shallow, natural body of water, Rice Lake, and several smaller ponds in the Black River bottoms area.

[[Brice Prairie]] is an urban reserve area within the City of Onalaska, located below the ridge on which most of the city is situated. It lies to the northwest of the city's current northern border, and is directly on Lake Onalaska.

'''Richland Center''' is a city in [[Richland County, Wisconsin|Richland County]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States]], which also serves as the [[county seat]]. The population was 5,184 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Richland Center was founded in 1851 by [[Ira Sherwin Hazeltine]], a native of [[Andover, Vermont]]. Hazeltine was drawn to the site because of its abundant water power, fertile prairies, and its proximity to the geographical center of Richland County. Haseltine offered to donate land to the county if Richland Center was voted the county seat.&lt;ref&gt;Butterfield, C. W. (1884). ''History of Crawford and Richland Counties, Wisconsin''. Springfield, Illinois: Union Publishing Company. pp. 1150-1151.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1852 the Wisconsin Legislature formally declared Richland Center as the seat of justice for Richland County.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;An Act to Declare the County Seat of Richland County,&quot; Wisconsin Statutes 1852, c. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; The present Richland County courthouse was built at Richland Center in 1889.

In 1876, a [[Narrow gauge railway | narrow gauge]] railroad branch opened to connect Richland Center with the [[Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul Railroad]] at [[Lone Rock, Wisconsin]], providing an outlet for the town's commerce. The line was originally constructed with maple rails, but it was rebuilt as a standard gauge iron railway in 1880.&lt;ref&gt;Butterfield (1884). pp. 948-950.&lt;/ref&gt; On October 8, 1882, the town's railway depot was destroyed when an early morning fire ignited two kegs of gunpowder stored inside, causing an explosion that tore the roof from the building and scorched several nearby rail cars.&lt;ref&gt;Butterfield (1884). p. 1164&lt;/ref&gt; Another passenger depot built in 1909 still stands in Richland Center, and it today serves as a visitor center for the community.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.richlandchamber.com/vcenter.html Richland Center Visitor Center].&quot; Richland Chamber &amp; Development Alliance. Retrieved 2011-11-03.&lt;/ref&gt;

Richland Center became an important location for the [[women's suffrage]] movement in Wisconsin after Laura Briggs James, Julia Bowen, and other residents founded the Richland Center Woman's Club in early 1882. The club quickly became the largest suffrage group in the state and was influential in organizing the movement throughout Wisconsin.&lt;ref&gt;McBridge, Genevieve, G. (1993). ''On Wisconsin women: working for their rights from settlement to suffrage''. Madison, Wisconsin: University of Wisconsin Press. pp. 101-102.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Susan B. Anthony]] visited Richland Center in 1886. Later, Laura James' daughter [[Ada James]] became influential in the movement, helping to found the Political Equality League in 1909 and advocating for women's rights, pacifism, birth control, and prohibition.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&amp;term_id=1485 James, Ada Lois].&quot; ''Wisconsin Dictionary of History.'' [[Wisconsin Historical Society]]. Retrieved 2011-11-03..&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frank Lloyd Wright]] was born at Richland Center in 1867. The [[A. D. German Warehouse]], completed in 1921, is the only building designed by Wright in the city and is an early example of his [[Mayan Revival]] style.

==GTE==
GTE's heritage can be traced to 1918, when three Wisconsin public utility accountants (John F. O'Connell, Sigurd L. Odegard, and John A. Pratt) pooled $33,500 to purchase the Richland Center Telephone Company, serving 1,466 telephones in the dairy belt of southern Wisconsin. In 1920 the three accountants formed a corporation, Commonwealth Telephone Company,[citation needed] with Odegard as president, Pratt as vice-president, and O'Connell as secretary. Richland Center Telephone became part of Commonwealth Telephone, which quickly purchased telephone companies in three nearby communities. In 1922 Pratt resigned as vice-president and was replaced by Clarence R. Brown, a former Bell System employee.

'''Lake Geneva''' is a city in [[Walworth County, Wisconsin]], USA. The population was 7651 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. A [[resort town|resort city]] located on [[Geneva Lake]], it is popular with tourists from [[metropolitan Chicago]] and [[Milwaukee]].

==History==
Originally called &quot;Muck-Suck&quot; (''Big Foot'') for a [[Potawatomi]] chief,&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Wisconsin'', 1990, {{Listed Invalid ISBN|0-403-09907-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; the city was later named Geneva after the town of [[Geneva, New York]], located on [[Seneca Lake (New York)|Seneca Lake]], to which early settler John Brink saw a resemblance. Geneva, to avoid confusion with the nearby town of [[Geneva, Illinois]], was renamed ''Lake Geneva''; later the lake was renamed ''Geneva Lake''.

Railroad access from Chicago made the area a popular summer retreat for the barons of wealth in lumber, cattle, oil, steel, cement, manufacturing, and durable goods (e.g., [[Morton Salt]], [[Wrigley's Spearmint|Wrigley Chewing Gum]]), with mansions and large homes such as Stone Manor and [[Black Point (estate)|Black Point]] built on the lake from the 1850's, through the heyday of the [[Roaring Twenties|Roaring 20s]], and up to the present day. The city was then known as &quot;The [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]] of the West.&quot; In the early automobile era, the city hosted the first modern drive-in motel designed by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], and later during [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] smaller lake towns around the area became a haven for [[Al Capone]] and other mobsters.{{cn|date=September 2013}}

In 1954, Lake Geneva was one of the three finalists for the location of the new [[United States Air Force Academy]], but ultimately lost to [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Simon&quot;&gt;Steven A. Simon, &quot;A Half-Century of History&quot;, ''Fifty Years of Excellence: Building Leaders of Character for the Nation,'' 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hugh Hefner]] built his first Playboy resort in Lake Geneva.{{when|date=September 2013}} The club closed in 1981 and was converted into the Americana Resort, and later to the present Grand Geneva Resort.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/15808339/guns_n_roses_outta_control_the_rolling_stone_cover_story/3&lt;/ref&gt;

Lake Geneva was the home of ''[[Dungeons and Dragons]]'' creator [[Gary Gygax]] until his death in 2008.

Royal Records (formerly Shade Tree Studios) was a Lake Geneva music recording studio where artists such as [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]], [[Cheap Trick]], [[Queensryche]], [[Crash Test Dummies]], [[Iron Maiden]], and [[Skid Row (American band),|Skidrow]] have recorded albums.

The city was named for an old beaver dam located in a stream flowing into [[Beaver Dam River]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Beaver Dam [brief history&quot;, in ''Dictionary of Wisconsin History'' http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&amp;term_id=15129&lt;/ref&gt;  The area had also been known as ''Okwaanim'', [[Chippewa language|Chippewa]] for beaver dam.&lt;ref&gt;Virgil J.

Neenah was named by Governor [[James Duane Doty]] for the Winnebago word for &quot;water&quot; or &quot;running water&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&amp;term_id=3870&amp; Neenah [origin of place name&amp;#93;&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  It was the site of a [[Ho-Chunk]] village in the late 18th-century.  

The area was first designated an industrial and agricultural mission to the [[Menominee Indians]] in 1835, and early settlement by Americans of European descent began a few years later, stimulated in large part by the proximity of the area to the Fox River.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ci.neenah.wi.us/heritage.html City of Neenah, Wisconsin - Heritage&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Altoona''' is a city in [[Eau Claire County, Wisconsin|Eau Claire County]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States]]. The population was 6,789 as of July 1, 2011. The city is a railroad terminal on the [[Union Pacific Railroad]].

==History==
The settlement of Altoona began in 1881 when the [[Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis and Omaha Railway]] selected the site for a new terminal to replace the overcrowded existing terminal in [[Eau Claire, Wisconsin|Eau Claire]]. The railroad had originally planned to put the new terminal in [[Fall Creek, Wisconsin|Fall Creek]], but the city of Eau Claire lobbied for a site closer to the existing one, and representatives from Eau Claire and the railroad walked the tracks from Fall Creek to Eau Claire to determine a suitable site. When the location of present-day Altoona - approximately three miles east of the existing Eau Claire terminal - was found to have sufficient flat land and access to water (via the [[Eau Claire River (Chippewa River)|Eau Claire River]]), the railroad began construction of the new terminal and the community of &quot;East Eau Claire&quot; was platted in October.

Residents began moving into the community in early 1882 and the railroad terminal became operational in May of that year. However, confusion between the &quot;Eau Claire&quot; and &quot;East Eau Claire&quot; stations quickly caused the railroad to rename the new terminal &quot;Altoona&quot; on October 14, 1882. Altoona was incorporated as a city on April 5, 1887.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hagen, Gerald A.|year=1987|title=A History of Altoona|publisher=Altoona Printing, Inc., Altoona, WI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Continued growth in both Altoona and Eau Claire over the past century has left the two cities adjacent to one another, with Fairfax St. and [[Business route|Bus]]. [[U.S. Highway 53|53]] providing a general boundary between the two, although the actual border is irregular. Altoona is bounded on the north by [[Lake Altoona (Wisconsin)|Lake Altoona]] and the Eau Claire River. To the south, the city limits generally follow [[U.S. Highway 12]] and [[Otter Creek (Eau Claire River)|Otter Creek]].

==Geography==
Altoona is located at {{coord|44|48|15|N|91|26|32|W|type:city}} (44.804110, -91.442183).{{GR|1}}

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|4.86|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which, {{convert|4.65|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.21|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.&lt;ref name =&quot;Gazetteer files&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Altoona is situated near [[Lake Altoona (Wisconsin)|Lake Altoona]], a man-made lake, with water provided by the Eau Claire River.

'''Kaukauna''' {{IPAc-en|audio=kaukauna.ogg|k|ə|ˈ|k|ɔː|n|ə}} is a [[Political subdivisions of Wisconsin#City|city]] in [[Outagamie County, Wisconsin|Outagamie County]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States]]. It is situated on the [[Fox River (Wisconsin)|Fox River]], approximately 100 miles (161&amp;nbsp;km) north of [[Milwaukee]]. The population was 15,462 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. It is a part of the [[Appleton, Wisconsin]] [[Metropolitan Statistical Area]].

==History==
Prior to 1880, and shortly afterwards, Kaukauna was known as &quot;The Lion on the Fox.&quot; This nickname was changed to &quot;The Electric City&quot; upon the completion of the [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric plant]]. When the city was incorporated in 1885, it was separated from the adjacent rural parts of [[Kaukauna (town), Wisconsin|the town]].  The first recorded land deed in Wisconsin was assigned to Dominique Ducharme in 1793.  He obtained 1,281 acres from the Menominee indians for 2 barrels of rum and other gifts. These acres are the original site of the town of Kaukauna. The property was purchased by Charles A. Grignon (and recorded Dec. 18, 1828), who built a mansion on the river on Kaukauna's north side. The home, which bears Grignon's name, is operated as a museum by the Outagamie County Historical Society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxvalleyhistory.org/mansion.html http://www.foxvalleyhistory.org/mansion.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|8.06|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which, {{convert|7.66|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.40|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.&lt;ref name =&quot;Gazetteer files&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city is divided into the North Side and South Side by the [[Fox River (Wisconsin)|Fox River]], which is spanned by five bridges.

==Transportation==
Kaukauna is located at the intersections of several major roads.  [[US 41]], which forms the backbone of the [[Fox Cities]]' transit network, runs along the northern edge of the city and intersects [[Wisconsin Highway 55]], [[Wisconsin Highway 96]], and two county roads that serve as major thoroughfares in the city. [[U.S. Route 10|US 10]] is just to the south of Kaukauna, and [[Wisconsin Highway 441]] is just to the west.

Kaukauna is a member of [[Valley Transit]], which provides [[bus]] service.

==Economics==
The city has diverse industrial and manufacturing businesses, including the Oscar Thilmany Paper Mill, constructed in 1883.  The name dropped off the mill when it was purchased by HammerMill in 1969, which was in turn bought by [[International Paper]] in 1986.  In 2005, [[New York City|New York]]-based [[Ownership equity|equity firm]] [[Kohlberg &amp; Company]] bought the mill, changed the name back to [[Thilmany]], and created a company of the same name. Kaukauna cheese, once made in the city, is now manufactured by the [[Fromageries Bel|Bel/Kaukauna]] corporation in the neighboring [[Political subdivisions of Wisconsin#Village|village]] of [[Little Chute, Wisconsin|Little Chute]].

==Education==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Ghost.GIF|thumb|left|The Kaukauna High School [[mascot]], the Galloping Ghost.]] --&gt;
Kaukauna is served by the Kaukauna Area School District, whose enrollment totals almost 4,000 students between kindergarten and 12th grade.  The city has four elementary schools and one middle school. Two [[Parochial school|parochial]] schools for children through the eighth grade exist in Kaukauna. Kaukauna's Catholic parishes have created the Kaukauna Catholic School System, and Trinity Lutheran School is operated by Trinity Lutheran Church.

Kaukauna has one public high school, named for the city, with an enrollment of approximately 1,350.  The current school was constructed in 1999 to replace the first Kaukauna High School, which the district had outgrown despite expanding the building twice after its construction in the late 19th century.  The school's mascot is the Galloping Ghost, supposedly named after a football game in the early days of the school.  On a foggy night, the announcer was heard to describe the running back as a Galloping Ghost - possibly a reference to [[Red Grange]], a professional football player whose nickname was &quot;The Galloping Ghost&quot;.

Kaukauna athletics participate in the [[Fox Valley Association]] Conference with nine other [[Fox Valley (Wisconsin)|Fox Valley]] schools. Rivals include the neighboring [[Kimberly, Wisconsin|Kimberly]] Papermakers.

==Religion==
Kaukauna has two Lutheran churches: Bethany Lutheran Church (Missouri Synod) and Trinity Lutheran Church (Wisconsin Synod), and two Roman Catholic churches: Holy Cross and St. Katharine Drexel.

}} '''Merrill''' is a city in [[Lincoln County, Wisconsin|Lincoln County]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States]]. It is located to the south of and adjacent to the [[Merrill (town), Wisconsin|Town of Merrill]]. The population was 9,661, according to the [[2010 United States Census |2010 census]].&lt;ref&gt;http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/55/5551250.html&lt;/ref&gt; Merrill is part of the [[United States Census Bureau]]'s Merrill [[Micropolitan Statistical Area|MSA]], which includes all of [[Lincoln County, Wisconsin|Lincoln County]]. Together with the [[Wausau, Wisconsin|Wausau]] [[United States metropolitan area|MSA]], which includes all of [[Marathon County, Wisconsin|Marathon County]], it forms the Wausau-Merrill [[Combined Statistical Area|CSA]].

==History==
Merrill was first inhabited by the Chippewa Native Americans. The first settlement there was a logging town named Jenny Bull Falls. By 1843 a trading post was constructed near the town; John Faely was the first settler. Within four years a dam, started by Andrew Warren, was constructed over the [[Wisconsin River]]. Warren then established the first mill powered by the dam, and other saw mills in the area. In 1870, T.B. Scott succeeded Warren, and the mill soon became increasingly successful. In 1899 the mill burned down. During that time the name of the community was changed to Merrill,&lt;ref&gt;http://merrillchamber.com/merrill_commerce/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=50&amp;Itemid=59&lt;/ref&gt; in honor of S.S. Merrill, the general manager of the [[Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul, and Pacific Railroad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.merrill.wi.us/general/history_frame.html|title=The Merrill Story|publisher=City of Merrill|accessdate=2009-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1880s and 1890s, a number of significant events occurred. In 1881, the Wisconsin Telephone company began operation, with 20 phones in service. In 1883 the first City Council met and T.B. Scott was named the first mayor. By 1885 the population had risen to 7,000, approximately 3,000 less than Merrill's population today.&lt;ref&gt;http://merrillchamber.com/merrill_commerce/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=50&amp;Itemid=59&lt;/ref&gt; The railroad and passenger depot was a hub of social activity through the lumber industry's boom years and after. It later became a community youth center, but has since been razed. By 1900, the timber industry was in decline and the community was compelled to diversify its economy.

'''Stanley''' is a [[city]] in [[Chippewa County, Wisconsin|Chippewa]] and [[Clark County, Wisconsin|Clark]] counties in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Wisconsin]]. The population was 3,608 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. Of this, 3,602 were in Chippewa County, and only 6 in Clark County.

== History ==
Stanley was settled and platted in 1881 when the [[Wisconsin Central Railway (1897–1954)|Wisconsin Central Railway]] built its line through the area.  The main early businesses were a small steam sawmill and some [[charcoal]] [[kiln]]s built by the York Iron Company in 1887.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Forrester|first=George|title=Historical and Biographical Album of the Chippewa Valley Wisconsin|year=1891-2|publisher=A. Warner|location=Chicago, Ill|pages=61|url=http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/wch&amp;CISOPTR=14519&amp;REC=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1891 the Northwestern Lumber Company from Eau Claire started a big lumber mill at Stanley and spawned the Stanley, Merrill and Phillips Railway to haul logs out of the country to the north and south where it held timber lands.  (The railway never reached Merrill or Phillips; its furthest reach was Wallrath, to the north of [[Jump River (CDP), Wisconsin|Jump River]].)  The mill in Stanley sawed wood until 1920, when Northwestern's timber holdings in the area were largely exhausted.  Over that period, the mill is estimated to have sawed 850 million board feet of lumber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nagel|first=Paul|title=S.M.&amp;P. Ry. - The Stanley, Merrill and Phillips Railway|year=1979|publisher=Print-it Press Company|location=Chippewa Falls, Wisc.|pages=6–10, 44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stanley became a village in 1895 and a city in 1898.

On May 18, 1906 a fire started in one of the Northwest Lumber Company buildings east of the current Chapman Lake in what is now Fandry Park.  The fire quickly spread to other businesses and into the residential area to the east.  It ended up destroying a number of business buildings, two churches, and about seventy homes.  But neighbors helped neighbors, businesses rebuilt (some with fireproof brick), and the city moved on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hoffman|first=Arnie|title=Stanley fire among most damaging|url=http://www.usgennet.org/usa/wi/county/eauclaire/history/ourstory/vol5/stanley.html|accessdate=2011-11-11|newspaper=Our Story 1776-1976 - insert in Eau Claire Leader Telegram|year=1976|author2=Jean Anderson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Northwestern Lumber Company had started a [[brickyard]] around 1900, digging its clay north of Chapman Park's location.  After the fire in 1906, production increased greatly to rebuild Stanley and buildings as far off as Eau Claire and Auburndale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Brickmaking once Booming Business|url=http://www.usgennet.org/usa/wi/county/eauclaire/history/ourstory/vol3/brickmaking.html|accessdate=2011-11-11|newspaper=Our Story 1776-1976 - insert in Eau Claire Leader Telegram|year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the decline of logging, agriculture became important - particularly dairy farming.

On May 20, 2002, the city annexed a portion of land in the [[Thorp, Clark County, Wisconsin|Town of Thorp]] in [[Clark County, Wisconsin|Clark County]].

==''Syttende Mai'' festival==
[[Image:Westby Norseman.jpg|right|thumb|180px|The Westby Norseman]]
Westby's most popular event is the Syttende Mai festival, an annual three-day event held in mid-May. The festival stems from Westby's [[Norway|Norwegian]] roots, [[Syttende Mai]] being a Norwegian holiday (&quot;Syttende Mai&quot; translates to &quot;Seventeenth of May&quot;) celebrating Norway's independence and the signing of the Norwegian Constitution.

The festival's main attractions are the cultural shops, where many Norwegian products are sold; the food stands; and the troll hunt. At the start of the weekend, a small troll, standing several inches tall, is hidden somewhere within the city limits. A clue is posted downtown on each of the three days until someone finds the troll. The prize for retrieving the troll is $50.

Westby has one of the largest ski jumps in the United States, where the [[Snowflake ski jump|Snowflake Ski Club]] hosts an annual ski jump event at the end of January and the beginning of February. The event includes a parade to introduce all of the participating countries, a competition for &quot;Snowflake&quot; royalty, and opportunities for local businesses to sell their wares. The event attracts competitors from all over the ski jumping world.

Tomah was founded by Robert E.

==History==
[[File:2009-0620-ChippewaFalls-Spring.jpg|thumb|right|The original Spring House.]]
Chippewa Falls was originally a [[lumber]] town that became a [[railroad]] town, even though the main railroad line of the 1870s went through [[Eau Claire, WI|Eau Claire]], about 10 miles to the south. In 1870, the [[West Wisconsin Railway]] built a line from [[St. Paul, Minnesota]], to [[Milwaukee, WI|Milwaukee]] through the area at Eau Claire. Following this, the [[Eau Claire and Chippewa Falls Railway]] established a line running from Eau Claire to Chippewa Falls. In 1880, the CF&amp;W was joined by the [[Wisconsin and Minnesota Railway]] pushing its way west from [[Abbotsford, WI|Abbotsford]]. This was followed in 1881 by the [[Chippewa Falls &amp; Northern Railroad]], which built a line north from Chippewa Falls to [[Bloomer, WI|Bloomer]], eventually being extended to [[Superior, WI|Superior]].

Around 1700, French explorer [[Pierre-Charles Le Sueur]] discovered the Chippewa Spring near the river. Politician [[Thaddeus C. Pound]] founded the Chippewa Springs Health Club in 1887 and at one point oversaw the company that bottled the water for sale. A Spring House was built over the original spring in 1893 and remains today, across from the modern water bottling plant on Park Ave.&lt;ref name=CF15&gt;[http://www.chippewacounty.com/visit/HistoricalMarkers-15.asp Chippewa Springs], Chippewa County Tourism Council, Accessed July 19, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
[[File:2009-0620-ChippewaFalls-Heyde.jpg|thumb|right|The original McDonell High School is now a public arts center.]]
The Chippewa Falls Area School District (CFSD) serves the city of Chippewa Falls. It has two high schools: [[Chippewa Falls High School|Chippewa Falls Senior High]] and Chippewa Falls Alternate High School; two middle schools: Chippewa Falls Middle School, and Chippewa Falls Alternate Middle School; and six elementary schools: Parkview, Hillcrest, Southview, Stillson, Halmstad, and Jim Falls Elementary.

In addition there are several parochial schools: [[McDonell Central Catholic High School]], Notre Dame Middle School, Holy Ghost, St. Charles, and St. Peter Elementary Schools, all of which are part of the Chippewa Area Catholic Schools (CACS).

The original McDonell High School building, sitting at a prominent location above downtown Chippewa Falls, is listed on the State and [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Wisconsin#Chippewa County|National Register of Historic Places]]. The structure was built in 1907 and, after the school moved to a more suburban location, it sat abandoned for a number of years until it was taken over by the Chippewa Valley Cultural Association and converted into the Heyde Center for the Arts in 2000.

==In popular culture==
Chippewa Falls is the birthplace and hometown of the fictional characters [[Grand Slam (G.I. Joe)|Grand Slam]] of [[G.I. Joe]], [[Jack Dawson (Titanic)|Jack Dawson]] in the movie ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'', [[Jennifer Keller|Dr. Jennifer Keller]] in the science fiction series ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]'', [[Dorothy McGuire]]'s character in the movie ''[[Till the End of Time (film)|Till the End of Time]]'' and the title character of ''[[Annie Hall]].''

'''Fort Atkinson''' is a city in [[Jefferson County, Wisconsin|Jefferson County]], [[Wisconsin]],  [[United States]]. It is located on the [[Rock River (Illinois)|Rock River]], a few miles upstream from [[Lake Koshkonong]]. The population was 12,368 at the 2010 census.

== History ==
Fort Atkinson was named after General [[Henry Atkinson (soldier)|Henry Atkinson]], the commander of U.S. forces in the area during the [[Black Hawk War]] (1832) against a mixed band of [[Sauk people|Sauk]], [[Meskwaki]] and [[Kickapoo people|Kickapoo]] peoples. The city developed at the site of [[Fort Koshkonong]], which was used during that war.  A replica of the original 1832 stockade has been built just outside of town, although not at the original site.  The fort was located to control the [[confluence]] of the Rock and [[Bark River (Rock River)|Bark]] rivers.

The settlement grew rapidly in the mid-nineteenth century, after migration of United States pioneers from the East, especially from New York State and the northern tier. They were among the many migrants carrying the New England Yankee culture west across the northern tier of states.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Hackett Fischer]], ''[[Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America]]''. 1989).&lt;/ref&gt;

The history and natural history of Fort Atkinson and the surrounding area are presented at the [[Hoard Historical Museum]] and [[National Dairy Shrine]] Museum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hoardmuseum.org Hoard Museum information]&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Dempster Hoard]] founded the nationally distributed [[dairy]] [[farm]] magazine, ''[[Hoard's Dairyman]]'', in Fort Atkinson in 1885. The museums include the Frank and Luella Hoard House, the Dwight and Almira Foster House, and the Knox Research Library and Archive. The Dairy Shrine portion of the complex portrays the past, present, and future of the dairy industry.

The oldest man-made features near Fort Atkinson are a cluster of [[prehistoric]] earthworks [[Native Americans in the United States|indigenous]] mounds located just south of town. In a curious honor, settlers named them the General Atkinson Mound Group.  Thes mounds are a remnant of the Woodland Period within present-day Wisconsin. They are effigy and geometric mounds, different from the platform mounds at nearby [[Aztalan State Park]], built by peoples of the Mississippian culture, which reached its peak about 1300 CE, had settlements throughout the Mississippi Valley and its tributaries, extending from central Illinois northward to the Great Lakes and also to the Southeastern United States.  Materials were traded within the culture from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico.    A {{convert|125|ft|m|sing=on}} long panther [[intaglio (burial mound)|intaglio]] appears on an mound west of town, the last remaining intaglio in the state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wisconsinstories.org/2001season/native/nj_journey.html  &quot;Indian Mounds&quot;], Wisconsin Stories website&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Fort Atkinson's 19th- and early 20th-century building history is preserved in the [[Main Street Historic District (Fort Atkinson)|Main Street]] and [[Merchants Avenue Historic District|Merchants Avenue]] historic districts. Other [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Jefferson County, Wisconsin|Registered Historic Places]] include the [[Fort Atkinson Water Tower]], [[Panther Intaglio Effigy Mound]], [[David W. and Jane Curtis House]], [[Hoard's Dairyman Farm]] and [[Jones Dairy Farm]].

==Geography and climate==
[[File:Rock river flood FtAtkinson.jpg|left|thumb|Rock River floods downtown area, 2004]]
Fort Atkinson is located at {{Coord|42|55|38|N|88|50|26|W|type:city}} (42.927091, &amp;minus;88.840446).{{GR|1}}

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|5.82|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which, {{convert|5.67|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.15|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.&lt;ref name =&quot;Gazetteer files&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city developed along the river, which provided the earliest transportation pathways for trade and travel.  Occasionally the downtown area is flooded when the Rock River exceeds its banks. Just east of the city, the Bark River enters the Rock and can add considerable volume in certain seasons.  The Rock River is a tributary of the Mississippi River, which it joins at [[Rock Island, Illinois]].

'''Mineral Point''' is a city in [[Iowa County, Wisconsin|Iowa County]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States]]. The city is located within the [[Mineral Point (town), Wisconsin|Town of Mineral Point]]. Mineral Point is part of the [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]] [[Madison, Wisconsin metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]]. Wisconsin's third oldest city,&lt;ref&gt;[http://dnr.wi.gov/wnrmag/html/travel/1999/apr99.htm &quot;Get to the point&quot;], ''Wisconsin Natural Resources Magazine'', April, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Randy Curwen, [http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2008-09-07/travel/0809050580_1_wisconsin-river-badger-state-mississippi-river &quot;Southwest Wisconsin: The Badger State's beginnings&quot;], ''Chicago Tribune'', September 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Preserve America, [http://www.preserveamerica.gov/PAcommunity_closeups_mineralpointWI.html &quot;Preserve America Community Close-ups: Mineral Point, Wisconsin&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt; Mineral Point was settled in 1827, becoming a [[lead]] and [[zinc]] mining center during the 19th and early 20th centuries. Today the city's historical character has made it a regional tourist destination. The population was 2,487 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].

== History ==
The first European settlement at Mineral Point began in 1827. One of the first settlers to the area was [[Henry Dodge]] and his family who settled a few miles away from Mineral Point.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refFiedler1973|Fideler 1973]], p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; During the following year, large quantities of [[galena]], or [[lead]] ore, were discovered around the settlement in shallow deposits. Lead had many uses at the time, and settlers began to flock to the region hoping to make a living by extracting the easily accessible mineral. Lead deposits extended throughout an area that also included [[Dubuque, Iowa]] and [[Galena, Illinois]], but Mineral Point became the center of lead mining operations within the bounds of present day Wisconsin (then part of [[Michigan Territory]]). By 1829, the region's growing population led to the creation of [[Iowa County, Wisconsin|Iowa County]], which included all of the lead mining lands within the borders of Michigan Territory at the time. Mineral Point was established as the [[county seat]] later that year. During the [[Black Hawk War]] of 1832, residents of Mineral Point built [[Fort Jackson (Wisconsin)|Fort Jackson]] to protect the town from a possible attack.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refFiedler1973|Fiedler 1973]], p.36.&lt;/ref&gt; The young settlement's importance was further confirmed in 1834 when it was selected as the site of one of two federal land offices responsible for distributing [[Public domain (land)|public land]] to settlers within the area that now encompasses Wisconsin.

When [[Wisconsin Territory]] was created in 1836, Mineral Point hosted the [[inauguration]] of the first territorial governor, [[Henry Dodge]], and the territorial secretary, [[John S. Horner]]. During the ceremony, a design by Horner was officially recognized as the Great Seal of Wisconsin Territory. It displayed an arm holding a [[pickaxe]] over a pile of lead ore, demonstrating the importance of Mineral Point's early mining economy to the new territory. A census conducted in the months after the inauguration showed that Iowa County had  5,234 inhabitants, making it the most populous county in the Wisconsin Territory east of the Mississippi River.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refThwaites1895|Thwaites 1895]], p.249.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mineral Point remained an important lead mining center during the 1840s. Although the most easily accessible lead deposits on the surface were being exhausted by this time, new immigrants began to arrive with more refined techniques for extracting ore. The largest group came from [[Cornwall]], which had been a mining center for centuries. Experienced [[Cornish people|Cornish]] miners were attracted to the lead mining opportunities in Mineral Point, and by 1845 roughly half of the town's population had [[Cornish American|Cornish ancestry]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refNesbit1989|Nesbit 1989]], p.114.&lt;/ref&gt; The original dwellings of some of these early [[Cornish American|Cornish]] immigrants have been restored at the [[Pendarvis]] Historic Site in Mineral Point. Lead continued to be produced in abundant quantities by the [[Cornish American|Cornish]] miners, and in 1847, the ''Mineral Point Tribune'' reported that the town's furnaces were producing 43,800 pounds (19,900&amp;nbsp;kg) of lead each day.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refFiedler1973|Fiedler 1973]], p.84.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mining activity in Mineral Point began to decline in the following years. In 1848, the same year that Wisconsin achieved statehood, [[gold]] was discovered in [[California]]. Many experienced miners left Mineral Point to look for gold, and in all, the town lost 700 people during the [[California Gold Rush]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refFiedler1973|Fiedler 1973]], p.95.&lt;/ref&gt; While the lead industry in Mineral Point continued into the 1860s, the town never recovered its former importance. A further blow was struck in 1861 when the county seat of Iowa County was relocated to nearby [[Dodgeville, Wisconsin]], where it remains today. Afterwards there was an intense rivalry between the two cities, during which{{When|date=June 2010}} Mineral Point fired a cannon towards Dodgeville's direction.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

As lead mining declined in Mineral Point, [[zinc]] mining and [[smelting]] became important new industries. Zinc ore was discovered with increasing frequency near the bottoms of old lead mines. The Mineral Point Zinc Company was founded in 1882, and by 1891 it was operating the largest [[zinc oxide]] works in the United States at Mineral Point.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refFiedler1973|Fiedler 1973]], p.147.&lt;/ref&gt; Zinc mining and processing continued on a large scale until the 1920s.

[[Image:RiponWisconsinSign.jpg|thumb|right|Welcome sign]]
'''Ripon''' [ɹɪpɘn] is a city in [[Fond du Lac County, Wisconsin|Fond du Lac County]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States]]. The population was 7,733 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. The City of Ripon's official website claims the city's current population to be 7,701. The city is surrounded by the [[Ripon (town), Wisconsin|Town of Ripon]].

==History==

===Founding===
Ripon, named for the [[England|English]] cathedral city of [[Ripon]], [[North Yorkshire]], was founded in 1849 by [[David P. Mapes]], a former New York steamboat captain. [[John S. Horner]] was the one who named the town, and most of the streets (his house is still standing today). Within two years the city had absorbed the nearby commune of Ceresco, established in 1844 by the Wisconsin Phalanx, a group of settlers inspired by the utopian socialist philosophy of [[Charles Fourier]]. Mapes also initiated the formation of [[Ripon College (Wisconsin)|Ripon College]], originally incorporated as Brockway College in 1851.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.riponmainst.com/riponmainst/hist.html History of Ripon, Wisconsin]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Birthplace of the Republican Party===
[[File:Little White Schoolhouse Ripon Wisconsin Feb 2012.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Little White Schoolhouse]] of Ripon, listed on the [[List of Registered Historic Places in Wisconsin|List of Registered Historic Places]]]]
Meeting at a [[Little White Schoolhouse|school house]] in Ripon on February 28, 1854, some thirty opponents of the [[Kansas-Nebraska Act]] called for the organization of a new political party and suggested that Republican would be the most appropriate name (to link their cause with the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]). The group also took a leading role in the creation of the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] in many northern states during the summer of 1854. While conservatives and many moderates were content merely to call for the restoration of the [[Missouri Compromise]] or a prohibition of slavery extension, the group insisted that no further political compromise with slavery was possible.

The February 1854 meeting was the first political meeting of the group that would become the Republican Party. The modern [[Ripon Society]], a Republican think tank, takes its name from Ripon, Wisconsin.

'''Independence''' is a city in [[Trempealeau County, Wisconsin|Trempealeau County]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States]]. The population was 1,336 at the 2010 census. It is located at the confluence of Elk Creek and the [[Trempealeau River]].

==History==
Unless otherwise noted, the history below is taken from Gamroth (1976).

Independence is in the Town of Burnside, which corresponds with one of the [[Township (U.S.)|townships]] created under the [[Land Ordinance of 1785]]. Shortly after the naming of Burnside in 1863, settlers from [[Europe]] and the eastern U.S. began arriving in significant numbers.

The city of Independence owes its existence to a railroad and a man named David M. Kelly. Running almost parallel to the Trempealeau River is the [[Green Bay and Western Railroad]], which is part of a line originally intended to run from [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]] to [[Wabasha, Minnesota]]. Kelly was an enthusiastic promoter of building a depot for the new line in Burnside.

After much disagreement and dispute over its location, Green Bay and Lake Pepin (as the company was then known) agreed to build a depot if $5,000 could be raised by the residents to finance construction. The money was raised, and Kelly bought the land for the depot in 1876. He founded a village on the land and named it Independence in honor of the nation’s centennial of independence. The village was incorporated in 1885 and became a city in 1942.

Independence has outlived the depot that was once at its heart. The line began at Green Bay but eventually reached [[Winona, Minnesota]] instead of Wabasha. Passenger service was never very profitable. Under the inexorable pressure of the automobile, passenger service ended in 1949, but freight trains still use the line today.

==Geography==
Independence is located at {{coord|44|21|30|N|91|25|20|W|type:city}} (44.358425, -91.422217).{{GR|1}}

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|1.31|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which, {{convert|1.27|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.04|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.&lt;ref name =&quot;Gazetteer files&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is within the [[Driftless Zone]] of the [[Midwest]].

Just upstream from the intersection between Elk Creek and the Trempealeau is the dam impounding Bugle Lake. The present dam was built in 1935 as part of the [[Works Progress Administration]]. It replaced an earlier dam that had been built by a resident named W.S. Newton (Gamroth 1976, p.&amp;nbsp;35).  It later broke and flooded all of Arcadia, Wisconsin in 2011. Bugle Lake has peaceful canoeing, and a small park covers the island in the lake.

'''Wauwatosa''' is a city in [[Milwaukee County, Wisconsin|Milwaukee County]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States]]. The population was 46,396 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. Wauwatosa is located immediately west of [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], and is a part of the [[Milwaukee metropolitan area]]. It is named after the [[Potawatomi]] word for [[firefly]].&lt;ref&gt;Milwaukee Journal, April 12, 1957&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The lush [[Menomonee Valley]] of the Wauwatosa area provided a key overland gateway between the rich glacial farmland of southeastern Wisconsin and the Port of Milwaukee. In 1835, Charles Hart became the first permanent white settler, followed that year by 17 other families. The following year a United States Road was built from Milwaukee through Wauwatosa, eventually reaching [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]]. Charles Hart built a mill in 1845 on the Menomonee River which gave the settlement its original name of &quot;Hart's Mill&quot;. The mill was torn down in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Milwaukee Journal, July 12, 1914&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[civil township|Town]] of Wau-wau-too-sa was created by act of the Wisconsin Territorial Legislature on April 30, 1840. As of the 1840 [[United States Census|census]], the population of the Town of Wau-wau-too-sa or Wauwatosa was 342.&lt;ref&gt;Watrous, Jerome Anthony. ''Memoirs of Milwaukee County: from the earliest historical times down to the present, including a genealogical and biographical record of representative families in Milwaukee County'', Chicago: Western Historical Association, 1909; Volume 1, pp. 69-70.&lt;/ref&gt; The town government was organized in 1842. The town's borders originally extended from the present-day Greenfield Avenue in the south to Hampton Avenue in the north, and from 27th Street in the east to the [[Waukesha County, Wisconsin|Waukesha County]] line in the west, encompassing sections of present-day Milwaukee and [[West Allis, Wisconsin|West Allis]]. Most of the town was farmland through the remainder of the 19th century.

[[File:WI-Wauwatosa-1892.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Wauwatosa in 1892]]
In 1849 the [[Watertown, Wisconsin|Watertown]] [[plank road|Plank Road]] was constructed through Wauwatosa, mainly following the old Madison territorial road. In 1851 Wisconsin's first railroad (later [[The Milwaukee Road]]) established Wauwatosa as its western terminus. The Village of Wauwatosa was incorporated from the central part of the Town of Wauwatosa in 1892, and was rechartered as the City of Wauwatosa on May 27, 1897.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://192.159.83.40/SOS/pdf/THEOSOS_014/images/00008816.pdf |title=City of Wauiwatosa Incorporated May 27, 1897 Under General Law, Recorded Misc. Rec. Vol. 5, PG. 397; Boundary Description |accessdate=2007-04-08 |author=Village of Wauwatosa |publisher=Office of the Secretary of State of Wisconsin |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070704221400/http://192.159.83.40/SOS/pdf/THEOSOS_014/images/00008816.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s, the City of Wauwatosa more than doubled its size by [[annexation|annexing]] 8.5 square miles (22&amp;nbsp;km²) of land west of the [[Menomonee River]] from the Town of Wauwatosa, which became the home to several large cold storage and regional food distribution terminals. Industrial plants owned by firms including [[Harley-Davidson]] and [[Briggs &amp; Stratton]] were also constructed.

In the past 40 years, western Wauwatosa has become an [[edge city]] with an important commercial and retail district built up along Milwaukee's beltline [[Highway 100 (Wisconsin)|Highway 100]] and anchored by the [[Mayfair Mall]].

Wauwatosa received some national attention in 1992 when the Wauwatosa Common Council, threatened with a lawsuit, decided to remove a [[Christian cross]] from the City's seal adopted in 1957. The cross was replaced with the text, &quot;In God We Trust.&quot; The seal itself was designed by 9-year old Suzanne Vallier as an entry in a contest among Wauwatosa schoolchildren. The quadrants of the logo's shield represent, from top left going clockwise; an arrowhead representing the Indians who were the original inhabitants of the city, the mill representing Hart's Mill which was the original name of the city, the cross representing the &quot;city of churches&quot;, and the symbol used on street signs representing the &quot;city of homes.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Milwaukee Journal'', April 12, 1957.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|13.25|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, all land.&lt;ref name =&quot;Gazetteer files&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eastern Wauwatosa is also known for its homes and residential streets, at one time just a short streetcar ride away from downtown Milwaukee. Prior to the arrival of [[Dutch elm disease]], many of Wauwatosa's older residential streets had large gothic colonnades of [[American Elm]] trees. In Wauwatosa, the Menomonee Valley made it easier to quarry portions of the [[Niagara Escarpment]], which provided the necessary materials for sturdy, [[Cream City brick|cream-colored bricks]] and stout, limestone foundations used in many homes and public buildings throughout the region.

'''Lodi''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|oʊ|d|aɪ}} {{respell|LOH|dy}} is a city in [[Columbia County, Wisconsin|Columbia County]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States]]. The population was 3,050 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. Lodi is part of the [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]] [[Madison, Wisconsin metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]].

==Geography==
Lodi, is located at {{coord|43|18|51|N|89|31|51|W|region:US_type:city}} (43.314296, −89.530994).{{GR|1}}

Spring Creek, which runs from the Lodi marsh through downtown Lodi and empties into Lake Wisconsin, is a local spring-fed brown trout stream. Portions of the creek do not freeze over the winter and thus serve as host to brown trout and waterfowl, particularly mallards. Lodi has adopted this Spring Creek resident, which the residents have named &quot;Susie the Duck&quot;, as a mascot.

==History==
Isaac Palmer founded the village of Lodi in 1846 in what was then the Pleasant Valley Precinct of the [[Wisconsin Territory]]. Palmer chose this glaciated valley as the location for the Village of Lodi because of its water power potential. Spring Creek powered a sawmill that year and a grist mill followed in 1850.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scls.lib.wi.us/por/jones/images/00000019.pdf History]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Susie the Duck==
Lodi's nickname is ''Home of Susie the Duck'', and Susie has been the town's official mascot since 1948. Where Spring Creek crosses Main Street ([[Wisconsin Highway 113|Wis. Hwy 113]]) in downtown Lodi, there is a small creekside park where visitors can buy dried corn from [[vending machine]]s to feed the often present wild ducks. In this area is a small stone basket, inscribed with the name of former Lodi resident Engle Knerzer, and every year, invariably, a duck builds a nest there. When the first mallard settled in that location in 1948, it was nicknamed &quot;Susie&quot; by Jean Kasuboski (nee:  Breunig) the granddaughter of the police chief William Breunig.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Susie, Friends Enjoy Life In Duck Utopia at Lodi,&quot; The Capital Times, 17 April, 1965, Page 9. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Every year there is a &quot;Susie the Duck Day&quot; celebration, the highlight of which is the rubber duck race. Participants pay $5 for a small rubber duck. The thousands of ducks are then dumped into the creek where they &quot;race&quot; toward a finish line and prizes are awarded based on order of finish. This day is also an important parade day with many activities in [[Goeres Park]], brat stands on Main Street and in Goeres Park, and a [[beer garden]] in the park.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lodiwisconsin.com/chamber/susie/susie.php Lodi Chamber of Commerce&amp;nbsp;– Lodi, Wisconsin&amp;nbsp;– Susie the Duck&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lodi Agricultural Fair==
Lodi is one of three cities in the state of Wisconsin to have its own fair. This free fair, which has been running for 142 years, begins on the first Thursday of July and runs through Sunday. Exhibits include livestock judging, school artwork, baking contests, and local organization display booths. There are carnival rides and games. Attractions include tractor pulls and the hugely popular demolition derby. There is also a live music beer garden.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lodiagfair.com Lodi Agricultural Fair&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ice Age Trail==
A 1,000 mile plus hiking trail, the [[Ice Age Trail|Ice Age National Scenic Trail]], follows along the [[terminal moraine]] formed in the last ice age, which ended about 10,000 years ago. A portion of this trail runs through Lodi. The trail begins in [[Potawatomi State Park]] in [[Door County, Wisconsin|Door County]]. It then winds south through the state to [[Janesville, Wisconsin|Janesville]], then back north through Lodi, ending at the [[Dalles of the St. Croix River]] in [[Polk County, Wisconsin|Polk County]]. Geologic features along the route include [[drumlins]], [[kame]]s, lakes, ice-walled [[lake plains]], [[tunnel channels]], [[outwash plains]] and [[eskers]].

The Ice Age National Scenic Trail is administered by the [[National Park Service]], with assistance from non-profit volunteer organizations. Lodi's chapter  of the Ice Age Park and Trail Foundation maintains an office in downtown Lodi, with access to the trail several hundred yards away. The longest section of the trail in the area is about 6.2 miles. It begins at the Robertson Trailhead, south of Lodi on Lodi-Springfield Road off of [[Wisconsin Highway 60|Hwy. 60 West]].

Several other segments of the trail are located in or near Lodi, including a 1.3-mile segment on the corner of Lovering and Highway J and a 21-mile section north of the [[Merrimac Ferry|Colsac III Ferry]] on [[Lake Wisconsin]].

==Notable residents==

'''Platteville''' is the largest city in [[Grant County, Wisconsin|Grant County]] in southwestern [[Wisconsin]]. The population was 11,224 at the 2010 census, growing 12% since the 2000 Census.  Much of this growth is likely due to the enrollment increase of the [[University of Wisconsin–Platteville]]. It is the principal city of the Platteville Micropolitan Statistical area which has an estimated population of 49,681.

==Geography==
Platteville is located at {{coord|42.73707|-90.477501|type:city_region:US|format=dms|display=inline}} (42.73707, -90.477501).{{GR|1}} It is in the Hollow Region, as named by early southern miners, in the rolling hills of southwestern Wisconsin.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|5.45|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, all of it land.&lt;ref name =&quot;Gazetteer files&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Platteville is serviced by [[Wisconsin Highway 80|Wisconsin State Highways 80]] and [[Wisconsin Highway 81|81]], as well as [[U.S. Highway 151]]. Originally, U.S. 151 went through the valley that made up the southern border of the city limits, but with the completion of the four-lane limited-access superhighway, traffic has been rerouted and now loops south of the city.

The minerals in the area consist of [[galena]], a sulfide of [[lead]] (lead 86.6, sulfur 13.4).  Sphalerite or [[zinc]] sulfide is also, common in the region. Zinc and lead mining were in heavy production through the 1820s - 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Fatzinger, Dale Rodger. &quot;Historical Geography of Lead and Zinc Mining In Southwest Wisconsin 1820-1920: A Century of Change.&quot; PhD diss., Michigan State University, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, there are few straight streets in Platteville. As a result of the mining in the 1800s, a honeycomb of abandoned old mines, streets were located to avoid the mines.

==History==
Platteville was a small farming and fur trading community along the Platte River, from which the town got its name. In the 1820s, [[lead]] ore or [[Galena]] was discovered in the area, a [[mining]] boom took the area by storm. The mining district encompassed a significant portion of southwest Wisconsin. More specifically, the counties of Grant, Iowa, Lafayette, and Jo Davies County (Illinois) played a major role in the mining of [[lead]] and [[zinc]] ore. The [[Galena, Illinois]] mining district, an area south of Platteville, had been known to many for years.&lt;ref&gt;Nesbit, Robert. ''Wisconsin A History''. 2nd ed. The University of Wisconsin Press: Madison, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;  Beginning in 1825, lead prices saw a dramatic boost and the Platteville economy flourished.&lt;ref&gt;Nesbit, 96.&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;grey gold&quot; (a common nickname for lead ore) was brought development of businesses and schools. Platteville's landscape was shaped by the mining that helped build the town, and mineral holes abounded everywhere.&lt;ref&gt;Fatzinger, 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1849s lead ore production was decreasing. However, the mining of zinc ore quickly filled the void for prospective work. Platteville was now an established town, complete with schools, an academy, newspaper, several churches, and a telegraph service as of November 1849.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hibbard, James. ''Images of America PLATTEVILLE'', Arcadia Publishing, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, a teachers' college and a mining college were founded. The Normal School was established on October 9, 1866.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbard, 37.&lt;/ref&gt; The Wisconsin Mining Trade School opened in January 1908.&lt;ref name=Hibbard83&gt;Hibbard, 83.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, these two colleges later merged to become Wisconsin State College and Institute of Technology.&lt;ref name=Hibbard83/&gt; It was not until 1971 that the college became [[University of Wisconsin–Platteville]], a school that specializes in engineering. Now a days, UW Platteville is also considered the best criminal justice college in the mid-west.&lt;ref name=Hibbard83/&gt;
[[Image:PostcardPlattevilleWIMainStreetAerialView1910.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Main Street, about 1910]]

Today, Platteville is mainly a college town, with some development in the white-collar sector. That growth is a result of the increasing number of engineering firms locating in Platteville to take advantage of UW-P's engineering program.

From 1984 until 2001 the [[Chicago Bears]] [[American football|football]] team held training camp on the campus of University of Wisconsin–Platteville. This resulted in a substantial infusion of money into the local economy each summer. That money stopped flowing after the Bears decided to hold training camp at Olivet Nazarene University in Illinois.

In 2004, the [[University of Wisconsin System]] gave its approval to the University of Wisconsin–Platteville's plan to expand the student enrollment from 5,000 to 7,500.

In 2004, [[U.S. Highway 151]] was upgraded to a limited-access highway whose lanes run further south of Platteville, bypassing the city. Prior to the upgrade, the highway exits were closer to Platteville and Platteville has already made changes to adjust to the new southern US 151 bypass. A new hospital was built just north of US 151 and next to its off ramps. A Walmart Supercenter and a Menards have opened near the northern end of the US 151 bypass.

==Education==
The [[Platteville School District]] serves the Platteville area. [[Platteville High School]] is the area's public high school. [[Platteville High School]]'s mascot is &quot;Henry Hillmen.&quot;

==Culture==
The main source of culture in Platteville is the Center for the Arts on [[University of Wisconsin&amp;ndash;Platteville]] campus, which sponsors a steady stream of well-attended professional touring events.

The &quot;Heartland Festival&quot;, a semi-professional theater festival that produces four shows that run throughout the summer, is a summer attraction featured at the UWP-Center for the Arts. The casts are a combination of professionals and local residents.

==Attractions==
;Stone Cottage
This home was built in 1837 by the Rev. Samuel Mitchell and still contains many of the original furnishings. The home was a home of the Major John Rountree, one of Platteville's founders. The walls of this home are two feet thick and made of dolomite Galena Limestone.&lt;ref name=stonecottage&gt;{{cite web | title = Attractions | publisher = Platteville Chamber of Commerce | url =http://www.platteville.com/PlattevilleTourism/tabid/56/Default.aspx | accessdate = 2009-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;The Big M
{{main|Platte Mound M}}
Platteville has the world's largest M, a claim that its Chamber of Commerce states is unchallenged.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} The M is a monogram for the former Wisconsin Mining School (now the University of Wisconsin–Platteville).

The first M was first constructed in 1936 when two men, Raymond Medley and Alvin Knoerr climbed the Platte Mound and trudged through 2 feet of snow to form a huge letter M. Actual construction of the stone M began in the spring of 1937 and was completed in the fall of the same year.

The M is composed of rocks laid on Platte Mound and is whitewashed (not painted) every year. The M is 241-feet tall, 214-feet wide and legs that are 25-feet wide.

The M can be seen many places in Platteville and sometimes in Iowa, on a clear day. Atop the Platte Mound and the M viewers can see three states: Wisconsin, Iowa, and Illinois.

The M is lit once a year during the University of Wisconsin - Platteville college homecoming. It is an attraction Platteville citizens generally appreciate.&lt;ref name=stonecottage/&gt;

;Rollo Jamison Museum and Mining Museum
At the museums one can tour the Lorenzo Bevan's 1845 lead mine, ride a 1931 zinc mine train, and view many exhibits on Platteville's mining history as well as Rollo Jamison's personal collection of artifacts.&lt;ref name=miningmuseum&gt;{{cite web | title = Attractions | publisher = Mining museum| url =http://www.mining.jamison.museum/index.html | accessdate = 2009-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mequon''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɛ|k|w|ɒ|n}} {{respell|MEK|won}}) is a city in [[Ozaukee County, Wisconsin|Ozaukee County]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States]]. The population was 23,132 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].

==History==
The area was originally inhabited by Native Americans; by the early 19th century, the [[Potawatomi]] occupied land west of the Milwaukee River, while the [[Menominee]] lived between the Milwaukee River and [[Lake Michigan]].&lt;ref name= &quot;corrigan&quot;&gt;Walter D. Corrigan, ''History of the Town of Mequon, Ozaukee County, Wisconsin, Brought Down to about 1870''. Mequon: Mequon Club, 1950.&lt;/ref&gt; European trappers, explorers and traders used the [[Milwaukee River]] through the middle of what is now Mequon as a means of transportation. The name &quot;Mequon&quot; is thought to have come from the Native-American word &quot;Emikwaan&quot; or &quot;Miguan,&quot; meaning ladle, referring to the shape of the river in the area.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.co.ozaukee.wi.us/history/YankeeSettler.htm &quot;Yankee Settler's Cottage.&quot;] [[Ozaukee County, Wisconsin]] website&lt;/ref&gt; The spelling was probably influenced by the French in the area at the time.

Between 1834 and 1836, a surveyor named Brink, along with his assistant Mr. Follett, surveyed the land to create the Town of Mequon.&lt;ref name= &quot;corrigan&quot;/&gt; Around this time, settlers came from New York and England, soon followed by [[Germany|German]] and [[Ireland|Irish]] immigrants. In 1839, a group of immigrants from [[Saxony]] settled near the Milwaukee River. In the same year, twenty families from [[Pomerania]] founded [[Freistadt]] (German: ''Free city'') in the western part of the Town of Mequon. The first [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] church in Wisconsin was built by these families in 1840.

John Weston served as the first postmaster of the Town of Mequon, having settled in present-day Thiensville in 1837. He later sold his holdings to [[John Henry Thien]]. Thien, a wealthy immigrant from [[Saxony]], had traveled north from [[Milwaukee]] and settled along the Milwaukee River, where his family built a dam and grist mill. Thien hosted the first town meeting for the Town of Mequon in 1846.&lt;ref name= &quot;corrigan&quot;/&gt; The area around his estate, one square mile in the middle of the Town of Mequon, was later incorporated as the village of [[Thiensville, Wisconsin|Thiensville]] in 1910. The Town of Mequon was incorporated as a city in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;Wisconsin Department of State, [http://sos.nmtvault.com/pdf/THEOSOS_043/images/00021146.pdf Mequon Certificate of Incorporation], May 24, 1957.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==

===Freistadt===
Freistadt is a neighborhood of the city of Mequon. The community's name means &quot;free city&quot; in [[German language|German]]. Originally in the Town of Mequon, the area was added to the City of Mequon through annexation.&lt;ref&gt;*[http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&amp;term_id=5544 Freistadt] in ''Dictionary of Wisconsin History''&lt;/ref&gt;

The community was founded in October 1839 by 20 German families who immigrated to the United States to escape religious persecution. The community was home to the first Lutheran church in Wisconsin. In 1845, the [[synod]], later known as the Lutheran Buffalo Synod, was organized here. (Through mergers the Buffalo Synod became a part of the [[American Lutheran Church]] and the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]]). The church in Freistadt became a part of the [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]] in 1848.&lt;ref&gt;Ozaukee County. [http://www.co.ozaukee.wi.us/history/Trinity.htm Trinity Evangelical Lutheran Church-Freistadt]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===
Mequon experiences four distinct [[season]]s, with variation in precipitation and temperature being very wide. The overall climate of the city is moderated by nearby [[Lake Michigan]], which causes temperatures to be cooler in summer and especially spring, and which keeps overnight temperatures warmer in winter. In March and April, the temperature in Mequon can be 10 to 15 degrees Fahrenheit (5 to 8 degrees Celsius) cooler than temperatures in towns just 15 miles (25 kilometers) further from the lake.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} In December and January, the effect is reversed, with temperatures in inland towns falling much lower.

In Mequon, the warmest month of the year is July, when the high temperature averages 81°F (27°C), with low temperatures of approximately 59°F (15°C). June and July are the wettest months of the year, with the majority of [[rain]] falling in short-lived [[thunderstorm]]s. January is the coldest month in Mequon, with average high temperatures averaging only 27°F (-3°C), and lows averaging 11°F (-12°C).&lt;ref name=TWC&gt;{{cite web|title=Average Weather for Mequon, WI - Temperature and Precipitation|url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/USWI0443|work=weather.com|publisher=The Weather Channel|accessdate=29 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; February is the driest month, with almost all precipitation falling in the form of [[snow]]. In an average winter, 47.0 in (1.3m) of snow falls. The city's proximity to Lake Michigan often [[lake-effect snow|increases]] the snow received by the city. Most of the city's snowfall comes from systems such as [[Alberta Clipper]]s and [[Panhandle Hook]]s.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

The highest temperature ever recorded in Mequon was 105°F (41°C) on July 24, 1935, and again on July 17, 1995. The coldest temperature ever recorded in the city was -40°F (-40°C), on January 17, 1982, also known as [[Cold Sunday]].&lt;ref name=TWC/&gt;

Phillips is home to the Price County Airport. Though the airport has light to infrequent air traffic, series of expansions have taken place to accommodate larger runways. Much of these expansions have negatively affected the neighboring community through the taking of land and clear cutting of forested areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Price County Airport Expansion Project Sees Opposition|url=http://www.wsaw.com/test/headlines/Price_County_Airport_Expansion_Project_Sees_Opposition_135520058.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name of West Allis derives from [[Edward P. Allis]], whose Edward P. Allis Company was a large Milwaukee-area manufacturing firm of the late 19th century. In 1901 the Allis company became [[Allis-Chalmers]], and in 1902 it built a large new manufacturing plant west of its existing plant. The locale in which the new plant was built was at the time called North Greenfield, and prior to the 1880s had been called Honey Creek. With the building of the western Allis plant, the area was incorporated as the Village of West Allis, and it became the City of West Allis in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westallishistory.org/ West Allis History]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''West Bend''' is a city in and the county seat of [[Washington County, Wisconsin|Washington County]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States]], in southeastern Wisconsin. As of the 2010 census, the population was 31,078.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=West Bend (city), Wisconsin|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/55/5585350.html|work=United States Census Bureau|publisher=quickfacts.census.gov|accessdate=13 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Before the arrival of European settlers in southeastern Wisconsin, the [[Potawatomi]] and [[Menominee]] Indians inhabited the land now occupied by the city of West Bend.

In 1845, the [[Wisconsin Territory|Wisconsin Territorial Legislature]] authorized the building of a road to connect [[Fond du Lac]] and [[Milwaukee]]. [[Byron Kilbourn]], one of the highway commissioners, and [[Jasper Vliet]], a surveyor, were put in charge of determining the route the road would take and of identifying a good halfway point for travelers. The path they chose is now [[U.S. Route 45]] and the rest stop is present-day West Bend. Because many people used the resting place, it evolved into a popular area. The [[Milwaukee River]] running through the town eventually played a major role in the city's history. It was because of the western bend in the river that West Bend got its name. The river also produced enough energy to power saw mills and gristmills. Early buildings included Holy Angels Catholic Church, built in 1852 at the corner of Hickory and 7th. In 1866 this building was converted into a school, and a new church was built at Elm and 7th under the direction of Reverend [[Johann Baptist Reindl]] (1827–1891).&lt;ref&gt;Heming, Harry Hooper. 1899.

Milwaukee: Catholic Historical Publishing Co., p. 954.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hawb.org/Parish/Pictures/Directory%20Pictures%20Page%201.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The railroad arrived in 1873, bringing with it more settlers and industrialization. At this time, West Bend saw a growth spurt, and in 1885 the city officially became an incorporated Wisconsin community.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ci.west-bend.wi.us/General%20Info/History%20of%20West%20Bend/history_of_wb.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Village of Barton===
In 1845 early settler Barton Salisbury, while on a surveying trip up the Milwaukee River, found a rapids that he believed would be a good source of power for a sawmill. He built a log hut on the west side of the river and the village of Barton was born. On November 1, 1961, the city of West Bend annexed the Village of Barton.&lt;ref&gt;A Short History of West Bend, city website&lt;/ref&gt;

===April 4, 1981 tornado===
On April 4, 1981, a [[April 4, 1981, West Bend tornado|tornado]] struck the city killing three people, and injuring another 53.  There is now a monument at a park near Green Tree Elementary School.&lt;ref&gt;http://ams.allenpress.com/archive/1520-0450/22/1/pdf/i1520-0450-22-1-181.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Library controversy===
In 2009, a controversy arose after a local couple complained to the  West Bend Community Memorial Library about the presence of &quot;sexually explicit books&quot; and &quot;books for youth on homosexuality&quot; in the young adult section of the library.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bannedinwestbend.info/west-bend-wi/documents/FebLetters.pdf?attredirects=0 Maziarkas' February 2009 Letters to West Bend Library]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.west-bendlibrary.org/alahandout.pdf Handout, West Bend Community Library]&lt;/ref&gt; A petition&lt;ref&gt;[http://sites.google.com/site/wbcitizens4safelibraries/Home/PetitiontotheWestBendLibraryBoard.doc?attredirects=0&amp;d=1 Petition to West Bend Library Board]&lt;/ref&gt; called on the library to label the identified books as explicit; to move them  to the adult section of the library; to install [[Internet filtering|Internet content filters]] on the library's computers; and to purchase books that represented &quot;a balance of materials related to heterosexuality and homosexuality&quot;. 

The West Bend Common Council refused to reappoint four library trustees whose terms were ending.&lt;ref&gt;[http://activepaper.olivesoftware.com/Repository/ml.asp?Ref=V0JETi8yMDA5LzA0LzIyI0FyMDAxMDI=&amp;Mode=HTML&amp;Locale=english-skin-custom Four Tossed Off Library Board], ''[[West Bend Daily News]]'', April 22, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; One councilman complained that the library board was stonewalling the complaint, while another asserted that the library trustees were not serving the interests of the community “with their ideology.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://activepaper.olivesoftware.com/Repository/ml.asp?Ref=V0JETi8yMDA5LzA0LzIyI0FyMDAxMDI=&amp;Mode=HTML&amp;Locale=english-skin-custom Id.]&lt;/ref&gt; The council's actions were widely criticized, and local citizens unsuccessfully sought to have the vote rescinded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ala.org/ala/alonline/currentnews/newsarchive/2009/may2009/westbendbdslammed5409.cfm Dismissal of Wisconsin Board Members Draws National Censure]''[[American Libraries]]'' May 4, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://activepaper.olivesoftware.com/Repository/ml.asp?Ref=V0JETi8yMDA5LzA1LzE5I0FyMDAxMDM=&amp;Mode=HTML&amp;Locale=english-skin-custom Vote on Library Board Stands] ''[[West Bend Daily News]]'' May 19, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schoollibraryjournal.com/slj/articles/censorship/857438-341/west_bend_city_council_fails.html.csp West Bend City Council Fails to Reinstate Library Board Members], ''[[School Library Journal]]'', May 20, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; After a public hearing on the petition in June 2009,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jsonline.com/news/ozwash/46772872.html Library board rejects restrictions], ''[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]'', June 2, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; the library board voted to reject any restrictions on young adults' access to books in the library.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jsonline.com/news/ozwash/46772872.html Id.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://activepaper.olivesoftware.com/Repository/ml.asp?Ref=V0JETi8yMDA5LzA2LzAzI0FyMDAxMDA=&amp;Mode=HTML&amp;Locale=english-skin-custom Library Board Will Stay the Course] ''[[West Bend Daily News]]'' June 3, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The Christian Civil Liberties Union filed a claim against the West Bend library, asking that [[Francesca Lia Block]]'s book ''Baby Be-Bop'' be &quot;burned or destroyed&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2009/US/07/22/wisconsin.book.row/ Library fight riles up city, leads to book-burning demand], [[CNN.com]], July 22, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=7874866&amp;page=1 Library Book Riles Small Wisconsin Town], [[ABCNews.com]], June 19, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon.com/books/feature/2009/06/16/francesca_lia_block/index.html A teen book burns at the stake], [[Salon.com]], June 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

West Bend Mutual Insurance Company was founded in the city in 1894&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesilverlining.com/default.aspx West Bend Mutual Insurance Co. website]&lt;/ref&gt; and West Bend Savings Bank (now Westbury Bank) in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manta.com/coms2/dnbcompany_crhk9s Manta.com on West Bend Savings Bank ]&lt;/ref&gt; The West Bend Aluminum Company (later the [[West Bend Company]]) was founded in 1911 by Bernhardt C. Ziegler,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/west-bend-co?cat=biz-fin West Bend Company website]&lt;/ref&gt; and remained in West Bend until 2003. Ziegler had previously founded the securities brokerage company B.C.

The strong economy in West Bend in the 1930s led ''[[Ripley's Believe it or Not]]'' to claim that West Bend was the only city in the [[United States]] that did not enter the [[Great Depression]]. In 1949, the printing company Serigraph, Inc. was founded in a garage in West Bend and went on to employ people all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.serigraph.com/history.html Serigraph History]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Gehl Company]] is also located in West Bend.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gehl.com Gehl Company website]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Christmas season, [[Santa Claus]] can often be found peering over the town from the musky's mouth.

== History ==
Originally inhabited by the [[Fox (tribe)|Fox]], [[Potawatomi]], and [[Ho-Chunk]] native American tribes, the area surrounding Mayville was settled primarily by German immigrants in the mid-nineteenth century. The city was founded in 1845 by Alvin and William Foster and Chester and E.P. May. May and Foster were looking for a good source of power for a saw mill.

The Mayville Historical Society's museum at the corner of Bridge and German streets occupies what once was the home and workplace of John Hollenstein and family, who came to Mayville in 1873. In 1876, Hollenstein built a home in Mayville and established a wagon and carriage factory, which he operated until 1908. He then sold it to his son, John Hollenstein Jr., who continued the business until 1941.

The Historical Society Museum now consists of the original wagon factory building, containing some of the original carriages built on the site. Also on the grounds are the Hollenstein home; Mayville's first firehouse, built in 1874, with its original equipment; and the Brunke Cigar Factory. Mayville was also home to Wisconsin's first iron smelter.

== Economy ==
Mayville is home to several large manufacturing facilities, including plants operated by [[TAB Products]], [[Mayvile Die and Tool]], [[Mayville Products Corporation]], [[Metalcraft]], [[Mayville Engineering Company]], [[Affiliated Products]], [[RCI Engineering]] and [[Gleason Reel]], a subsidiary of [[Hubbell Corporation]]. Dairy farming and other agricultural activities also comprise an important part of the local economy.

==Sports==
The Mayville High School football team won the 1994 WIAA Division 4 state championship and was runner-up in 1991, 1992, and 2006. The school has also won state championships in softball (1999), cross country - girls (1993 and 1994) and basketball (1935 and 1983). Mayville holds the Marsh Bowl trophy, which is awarded each year to the winner of the Mayville vs. Horicon football game.  Starting in 2013, the Mayville and Lomira football programs began a traveling trophy, known as the milk can trophy.  Mayville won the inaugural game.

The history of Mayville sports runs deep throughout the community. Mayville Football has been widely considered one of the most successful programs in the state. Led by Wisconsin Football Coaches Association Hall of Fame inductee Alex Hilber, the program regained the success that they experienced under longtime head coaches Ray Dunn and Jack Omer. Hilber led the Cardinals to a 161-30  record during his 17 seasons as head coach for the Cardinals. During his tenure, Hilber led the Cardinals to 1994 State Championship.

Mayville Baseball had a run of dominance the past decade that was unparalleled in the programs history. Led by Cory Held, the Cardinals went on to earn back to back conference titles in 2003 and 2004. In 2003, Mayville bolstered a record of 21-2 setting a school record for victories in a season. The 2003 team went on to advance to the sectional semi-final. The 2004 squad experienced similar success while advancing to the sectional final. Both squads parlayed their success to also earn back to back appearances in Wisconsin American Legion State Baseball Tournament (2003 &amp; 2004.)

==Events==
Mayville hosts an annual &quot;Audubon Days&quot; festival the first full weekend of October. Audubon Days is a culmination of Mayville's historic German roots, with festivities that include bed races, the &quot;Taste of Mayville&quot; food tent, duck races, a parade, kids games/crafts and live music.

From July 29 to August 2, 2009, Mayville hosted the Wisconsin American Legion Baseball Class A state tournament at Fireman's Field in Mayville. Fireman's field is widely considered to be one of the finest baseball parks in Wisconsin.

Fireman's field is maintained by the city of Mayville, and has become a destination for many high profiled sporting events. These events include the aforementioned 2009 Wisconsin American Legion Baseball State Tournament. Mayville was also named one of the four sectional sites for the WIAA Division 2 State Baseball Playoffs. Fireman's Field was also host the 2010 Junior State Legion Baseball Tournament.

'''Glendale''' is a city in [[Milwaukee County, Wisconsin|Milwaukee County]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States]]. The population was 12,872 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].

==Geography==
Glendale is located at {{coord|43|7|48|N|87|55|40|W|type:city}} (43.130060, -87.927719).{{GR|1}}

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|5.97|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which, {{convert|5.76|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.21|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.&lt;ref name =&quot;Gazetteer files&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Glendale was incorporated on December 28, 1950 from portions of the [[Milwaukee (town), Wisconsin|Town of Milwaukee]].&lt;ref&gt;http://sos.nmtvault.com/pdf/THEOSOS_042/images/00020939.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  It began to develop rapidly in the 1950s, reflecting post-World War II metropolitan growth and migration patterns throughout the United States. [[Bayshore Town Center]] (formerly called Bayshore Mall) was established on the eastern border of the city in 1954.

Unlike other northshore suburbs of Milwaukee, Glendale has a mix of industry and commercial sites in addition to residential areas. The southern areas of the city have mainly industrial and higher density residential sites, while the north features medium to lower density residential plots. [[Interstate 43]] divides the city into east and west sections. [[Nicolet High School]] is also located in Glendale and serves the city, along with the suburbs of [[Fox Point, Wisconsin|Fox Point]], [[Bayside, Wisconsin|Bayside]], and [[River Hills, Wisconsin|River Hills]]. Glendale has begun an ambitious campaign to attract business and population growth. Major roads have undergone massive streetscaping projects, Bayshore Town Center has undergone a multi-million dollar renovation, and the Glendale Business Park continues to welcome high tech clients.

'''Waupun''' {{IPAc-en|w|ə|ˈ|p|ɑː|n}}&lt;ref&gt;http://www.misspronouncer.com/towns/waupun.html&lt;/ref&gt; is a city in [[Dodge County, Wisconsin|Dodge]] and [[Fond du Lac County, Wisconsin|Fond du Lac]] counties in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Wisconsin]]. The population was 11,340 at the 2010 census.&lt;ref&gt;[http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/55/5584425.html 2010 Census returns]&lt;/ref&gt; Of this, 7,864 were in Dodge County, and 3,476 were in Fond du Lac County. In Fond du Lac County, there is also the [[Waupun (town), Wisconsin|Town of Waupun]] which abuts the city of Waupun.

Waupun also has the most outdoor public sculpture per capita of any city in North America.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} This includes the world famous &quot;[[End of the Trail (Wisconsin)|End of the Trail]]&quot; statue, The Dawn of Day, the Who Sows Believes in God, the Pioneers, and [[The Recording Angel]] among others. These statues are in Waupun because of the donation of Clarence Addison Shaler. Mr. Shaler is buried by his wife in Waupun's Forest Mound Cemetery.

==History==
Waupun comes for the Indian name of &quot;Waubun&quot; which means &quot;dawn of day.&quot; In fact Waupun was originally supposed to be named &quot;Waubun&quot; but the State of Wisconsin made a spelling error, and Waupun never bothered to change it.

Waupun was founded in 1839 by Seymour Wilcox, the first settler along the Rock River in what was then deciduous forested land. The territorial Census in 1847 showed Waupun Township to have a population of 956. In 1851, the city was chosen for the State Penitentiary, owing to the abundance of limestone for construction. The main building, constructed in 1854, is still in use. The population in 1940 was 6,725.

==Geography==
Waupun is located at {{coord|43|37|54|N|88|44|9|W|type:city}} (43.631577, -88.735835).{{GR|1}}

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|4.44|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which, {{convert|4.39|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.05|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.&lt;ref name =&quot;Gazetteer files&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relief of the city is moderate, ranging from {{convert|870|ft|m}} at the Rock River, to its highest elevation of {{convert|941|ft|m}} above sea level.

Waupun lies near the edge of the [[Horicon Marsh]], the largest cattail marsh in the United States, and is the principal access point to wildlife viewing for the Horicon Wildlife Refuges.

The Fond du Lac County Park, on the edge of Waupun, has preserved a remnant stand of old-growth  southern mesic forest, which once covered over {{convert|3|e6acre|km2}} of Southern Wisconsin.

'''Seymour''' is a city in [[Outagamie County, Wisconsin|Outagamie County]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States]]. The population was 3,451 at the 2010 census. The city is located within the [[Seymour, Outagamie County, Wisconsin|Town of Seymour]] and the [[Osborn, Wisconsin|Town of Osborn]].

==History==
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2012}}
Seymour was founded in 1868 and named after Governor [[Horatio Seymour]] of New York. Seymour is said to have once been called Squeedunk, which means &quot;little settlement&quot; or &quot;village&quot;.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

William and John Ausbourne were the first settlers in Seymour. They had traveled from western [[Outagamie County]] on the [[Wolf River]] during the summer of 1857, making their way to the mouth of the [[Shioc River]] and moving to a spot where the [[Black Creek]] flows into the Shioc. After finding no more roads to follow, the Ausbournes settled in the present location of Seymour, which was occupied by Native Americans at the time. There they built a log house, the only residence in Seymour for two years. Their closest neighbors lived in [[Osborn, Wisconsin|Osborn]].

Over the years more settlers came to Seymour. Willis and Dan Mungers arrived in 1864. They  built a house on what is now Main Street and their daughter Sally lived in a frame house on what is now South Main Street. Erastus C. Buttles came during the spring{{When|date=February 2011}} and established a farm in the western part of the county. Leaonard and Avery Carter arrived in Seymour in 1876, along with Charles Eichler, the first German settler in the area.

As more settlements were established in the area, the population grew. On March 1, 1877 Seymour became a recognized town, along with the towns of [[Osborn, Wisconsin|Osborn]] and [[Freedom, Outagamie County, Wisconsin|Freedom]].

During the early 1880s, construction of the [[Green Bay and Western Railroad|Green Bay and Lake Pepin Railroad]] was completed. In 1883 a station was built in Seymour, and soon Seymour was recognized as the smallest incorporated city in the nation.

When the settlers had built their houses, they turned to education, electing a school superintendent and an establishing a school tax..{{when|date=December 2012}} The schoolhouse was a simple one-room building with no floor and a shake roof. Sunday school soon began in the same building.

Between 1887 and 1889 George E. Mendell published the first newspaper, ''The Aurora'', which lasted only three years. On July 8, 1886 the ''Seymour Press'' made its first appearance, and was published by the Van Vuren family for over 80 years. It was then sold to the Shellman Publishing Company of Oconto Falls, and is still published today.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seymour.k12.wi.us/shs/teachers/Grassel/regionals/history.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Hamburger&quot; [[Charlie Nagreen]] served the world's first [[hamburger]] at the Seymour Fair of 1885&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seymourhistory.org/news/?id=35&lt;/ref&gt; when he decided to flatten a [[meatball]] and place it between slices of bread to increase portability.&lt;ref name=&quot;Special Attractions and Events&quot;/&gt;

The Seymour Community Historical Society was officially incorporated on October 11, 1975. A dedicated group of local historians led by Tom Duffey, Rita Gosse, and Bill Collar established the society with the assistance of the State Historical Society of Wisconsin. Since its inception, SCHS members have been active in collecting and preserving records and physical objects relating to the city of Seymour and the surrounding area.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seymourhistory.org&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 21, 2012 the new Seymour Community Museum opened.  The new facility built for $1.2 Million dollars which was entirely funded by private donors.&lt;ref&gt;http://advertisercommunitynews.com/2013/01/completion-of-new-seymour-community-museum-top-story-of-2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Appleton is the principal city of the Appleton, Wisconsin [[Metropolitan Statistical Area]], which is included in the [[Appleton-Oshkosh-Neenah, WI CSA|Appleton-Oshkosh-Neenah]], Wisconsin [[Combined Statistical Area]].

==History==
Fur traders seeking to do business with Fox River Valley Indians were the first European settlers in Appleton. Hippolyte Grignon built the White Heron in 1835 to house his family and serve as an inn and trading post.&lt;ref name='timeline'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.apl.org/history/ | title = History of Appleton | accessdate = 2011-12-28 | date = 2011-06-01 | publisher = Appleton Public Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Appleton was settled in 1847 and incorporated as a village in 1853. John F. Johnston was the first resident and village president. Home to [[Lawrence University]], Appleton grew along with the school. With the financial backing of [[Amos Adams Lawrence|Amos A. Lawrence]], the Lawrence Institute was chartered in 1847. [[Samuel Appleton]], Lawrence's father-in-law, donated $10,000 to the newly founded college library, and his name was given to the community in appreciation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.appleton.org/about Appleton.org | City of Appleton, Wisconsin&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epodunk.com/cgi-bin/genInfo.php?locIndex=23738|title=Profile for Appleton, Wisconsin|publisher=[[ePodunk]]|accessdate=2010-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The community was incorporated as a city on March 2, 1857,&lt;ref name='Wislaw'&gt;{{cite book | last = --- | title = Private and Local Laws Passed by the Legislature of Wisconsin in the Year 1857 | publisher = Calkins and Proudfit, Printers | year = 1857 | location = Madison, Wisconsin | pages = 243–283 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=U-IqAAAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Amos Storey as its first mayor. Early in the 20th century, it adopted the [[city commission government|commission]] form of government. In 1890, 11,869 people lived in Appleton; in 1900, there were 15,085; in 1910, 16,773; in 1920, 19,571; and in 1940, 28,436.

The paper industry, beginning with the building of the first paper mill in the city in 1853, has been at the forefront of the development of Appleton. In order to provide electricity to the paper industry, the nation's first hydro-electric central station, the [[Vulcan Street Plant]] on the [[Fox River (Wisconsin)|Fox River]], began operation on September 30, 1882. The power plant also powered the [[Hearthstone Historic House Museum|Hearthstone House]], the first residence in the world powered by a centrally located [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] [[Power station|station]] using the [[Thomas Edison|Edison]] system.&lt;ref name=BeloitDaily&gt;[http://www.beloitdailynews.com/articles/2005/12/15/news/news21.txt &quot;Victorian Christmas&quot;], ''[[Beloit Daily News]]'', December 15, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly thereafter, in August 1886, Appleton was the site for another national first, the operation of a commercially successful electric [[streetcar]] company. Electric lights replaced gas lamps on College Avenue in 1912. Appleton also had the first [[telephone]] in Wisconsin, and the first incandescent light in any city outside of the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&amp;term_id=15063&amp;term_type_id=2&amp;term_type_text=places&amp;letter=a Appleton [brief history&amp;#93;&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Appleton's [[Valley Fair Shopping Center]], built in 1954, laid claim to being the first enclosed shopping mall in the [[United States]], although this claim is disputed by other malls. In 2007 most of the structure was demolished, leaving only its east wing and a movie theater. A [[Copps Food Center]] now stands in its place.

'''Janesville''' is a city in southern [[Wisconsin]], [[United States]].{{GR|6}} It is the [[county seat]] of [[Rock County, Wisconsin|Rock County]]{{GR|6}} and the principal municipality of the Janesville, Wisconsin [[Metropolitan Statistical Area]]. As of the 2010 census, the city had a population of 63,575.&lt;ref&gt;[http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/55/5537825.html Janesville (city) QuickFacts from the US Census Bureau]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Janesville area was home to many Native American tribes before the settlement of people from the East. With the [[Indian Removal Act]] of 1830 many Native American peoples were uprooted and forced out of their homelands to make room for the American settlers, with many Native peoples, including the [[Ho-Chunk]] and [[Potawatomi]], being forced onto reservations.&lt;ref&gt;The Wisconsin Cartographer's Guild. ''Wisconsin's Past and Present: A Historical Atlas''. Madison, WI: University of Wisconsin Press: 1998, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Land surveys in the 1830s encouraged pioneers to settle in the area among the abundance of fertile farmland and woodlands. Many of these early settlers established farms and began cultivating wheat and other grains.

A key settler was Henry Janes, a native of Virginia who was a self-proclaimed woodsman and early city planner. Janes came to the area in the early 1830s and initially wanted to name the budding village “Blackhawk&quot; after the famous Sauk leader [[Chief Black Hawk]], but was turned down by Post Office officials. After some discussion it was settled that the town would be named after Janes himself and thus in 1835, Janesville was founded.&lt;ref name=&quot;hometown&quot;&gt;David Hestad. [http://www.wpt.org/wisconsinstories/janesville/ Wisconsin Hometown Stories: Janesville]. Madison, WI: Wisconsin Public Television, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
  
As the population grew in the Janesville area, several new industries began cropping up along the Rock River including flour and lumber mills. The first dam was built in 1844.&lt;ref name=&quot;hometown&quot;/&gt;

Some of the key settlers in the Janesville hailed from the [[burned-over district]] of western New York State which was an area marked by its abundance of Christian revival and awakening groups during the mid-19th century. These groups were also active in abolitionist and women’s rights movements.&lt;ref name=&quot;hometown&quot;/&gt;

Of these settlers was William Tallman who hailed from Rome, New York. Tallman came to the area in 1850 and bought up large tracts of land in hopes of inspiring his fellow New Yorkers to settle in the fertile Rock County. Tallman established himself as one of the most influential and affluent members of the budding Janesville populace. He was impassioned by the call for abolition and became a supporter of the Republican Party. One of the crowning moments in Tallman’s life was when he convinced the up-and-coming Illinois Republican [[Abraham Lincoln]] to speak in Janesville in 1859. [[Lincoln-Tallman House|The Tallman house]] is now a historical landmark and now best known as “The place where Abraham Lincoln slept”.&lt;ref name=&quot;hometown&quot;/&gt;

Janesville was very active during the Civil War. Local farms sold grains to the Union army, and Rock County was one of the counties in Wisconsin with the highest number of men enlisted.&lt;ref name=&quot;hometown&quot;/&gt;

After the Civil War, Janesville’s agriculture continued to surge and a greater demand for new farming technology led to the development of several foundries and farm machine manufacturers in the area. Among these were the Janesville Machine Company and the Rock River Iron Works. With the boom in the farm service sector and establishment of a rail system, Janesville soon began to ship goods to and from prominent eastern cities, including New York, Boston, and Philadelphia. After decades of rigorous grain farming, the soil quality around Janesville began to degrade. The farmers responded to this issue by planting tobacco which became one of the most profitable and prolific crops grown in Wisconsin during the late 19th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;hometown&quot;/&gt;

Another development during the mid-19th century was the establishment of a women’s rights movement in Janesville. The movement was founded in the 1850s and was continued after the Civil War. One of the key focuses of the group during the 1870s was the [[Temperance movement]].

One of the key developments in Janesville’s history was the establishment of a [[Janesville GM Assembly Plant|General Motors]] plant in 1919. The plant was initially established to produce Samson tractors, a company acquired by GM co-founder [[William C. Durant]]. Durant was encouraged by Joseph Craig, the president of Janesville Machine to build a plant to produce the Samson tractors in Janesville, to which Durant agreed. In the years following World War I the demand for tractors plummeted and the plant shifted its focus to the production of automobiles.&lt;ref name=&quot;hometown&quot;/&gt;

One of the most prominent turn of the century figures in Janesville was George Parker who developed new pen technologies and styles and eventually established the [[Parker Pen Company]]. His developments included the “lucky curve” ink feed system, and the “trench pen” a pen commissioned by the U.S. Army for use in World War I. Parker designed and established a headquarters and factory in downtown Janesville. The Parker Pen company was handed down to George’s son Ken who developed the revolutionary “Parker 51” in the 1940s. A Parker pen was used by Dwight Eisenhower to sign Germany’s Armistice agreement to end World War II in Europe, and subsequently [[General Douglas MacArthur]] used his 20 year old Parker Duofold in the signing of  Japan’s surrender at the end of the War in the Pacific. The Parker Pen Company was one of the top employers in the area for over 70 years. The company was eventually sold off in a leveraged buyout in the 1980s.&lt;ref name=&quot;hometown&quot;/&gt;

Another important figure in Janesville's history was John Nolan, who was hired by the city in 1919. Nolan was a city planner who saw the Rock River as a focal point for community and park development. His park planning established Janesville as the “City of Parks”.&lt;ref name=&quot;hometown&quot;/&gt;

Janesville was the site of the first [[Wisconsin State Fair]] in 1851, attended by approximately 10,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM2CJT FIRST - State Fair in Wisconsin - Janesville, WI - First of its kind on Waymarking.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

It assembled light-duty trucks and sport utility vehicles,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.janesvillecvb.com/tourgm.asp Janesville Convention and Visitors Bureau | Tour Opportunities&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; which declined in popularity as gasoline prices increased.&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/2008/06/03/news/companies/gm_announcement/index.htm &quot;GM: Trucks out, cars in&quot;, CNN Money], retrieved on 2012–09–02.&lt;/ref&gt; The plant closed in December, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.madison.com/tct/news/stories/index.php?ntid=309232 GM to close Janesville plant on December 23 2008], ''The Capital Times'', October 13, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jim Leute, &quot;[http://gazettextra.com/weblogs/latest-news/2008/oct/13/gm-employees-get-official-word/ GM employees get official word],&quot; ''Janesville Gazette'', October 13, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Production of General Motors sport-utility vehicles ended on December 23 and the remaining medium-duty [[Isuzu Motors|Isuzu]] assembly line ended operations on April 23, 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;end&quot;&gt;[http://www.gazettextra.com/news/2009/apr/21/thursday-last-day-production-isuzu-line-comes-end/ Thursday is last day of production as Isuzu line comes to end],&quot; ''The Janesville Gazette'', April 21, 2009.

The [[Parker Pen Company]] was founded in Janesville. At one time its factory was the largest writing instrument plant in the world. The company later purchased [[Manpower, Inc.]], but eventually sold the pen business to [[Global Gillette|Gillette]] and no longer operates in Janesville. It is now owned by the Sanford division of Newell Rubbermaid. The [[Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company]] was founded in Janesville in 1857 but moved to Milwaukee two years later.

The [[Janesville Mall]] redeveloped in the late 1990s, and in 1998 Pine Tree Plaza opened. In November 2006, a [[Walmart#Walmart_Supercenter|Walmart Supercenter]] and a [[Sam's Club]] opened after a period of controversy. The site of the former Janesville Oasis, known for Bessie, a large fiberglass [[cow]] at its entrance, began redevelopment in 2007; the anchor tenant is a [[Menards|Super Menards]]. Bessie the cow was  spared by popular demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= WJVL|title= Bessie the Cow is back!|url= http://wjvl.com/photos/galleries/2008/jun/16/bessie-cow-back/|date= June 16, 2008|accessdate=7 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Nelesen | first = Marcia |title= City to recognize &quot;Bessie the Cow Day&quot;|url= http://gazettextra.com/news/2008/jun/07/city-recognize-bessie-cow-day/|publisher = ''The Janesville Gazette'' | date= June 16, 2008|accessdate=7 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hedberg Public Library==
The library began in 1865 as a privately supported reading room for the Young Men's Library Association. After a referendum passed in 1884, it became a public library that was housed in rented quarters. In 1903, a new building was constructed with $30,000 from [[Andrew Carnegie]] and other donors. The city also agreed to appropriate $3,000 for library operations. The library then moved to its first official home across from the Rock County Court House on Main Street. When it outgrew these quarters in the early 1960s, a new library was built in 1968 at 316 S. Main Street.

Just 20 years later, the library began planning for expanded space. With $4.6 million donated by Don and Gerry Hedberg, local philanthropists, as well as city and other donated monies, an expanded and completely renovated library was opened in 1996. Janesville's public library was then renamed [[Hedberg Public Library]] in honor of its largest contributors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hedbergpubliclibrary.org A Brief History of Hedberg Public Library]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parks and recreation==
[[Image:5high.jpg|thumb|right|350px| Rock Aqua Jays]]Janesville is known as &quot;Wisconsin's Park Place&quot;. Its {{convert|2590|acre|km2|sing=on}} park system includes 64 improved parks, as well as boat launches, golf courses, and nature trails.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ci.janesville.wi.us/index.aspx?page=118 Janesville Parks Division]&lt;/ref&gt; This is one of the highest acreages ''per capita'' in Wisconsin.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

Janesville has a public, internationally-themed botanical garden, [[Rotary Gardens]], that was created from an abandoned sand pit.

Traxler Park is home to the [[Rock Aqua Jays]], a [[water skiing|water ski]] team that has been U.S. national champion 17 times. The team originated and regularly hosts the National Show Ski championships, and was the host of the first ever World Water Ski Show championship, with teams competing from Australia, Belgium, Canada and China. Traxler Park is also the site of the city's annual Fourth of July festivities.

Other major parks include Riverside Park, a recreational park along the Rock River including a [[golf]] course and a segment of the [[Ice Age Trail]]; Rockport Park, largely undeveloped, including the municipal swimming pool and Peace Park; Monterey Park, including the Big Rock, an early natural landmark signaling a good [[ford (crossing)|ford]] of the Rock River (and the namesake of the county, but not the river), as well as a sports stadium used by the school system; Lustig Park, used for a [[disc golf]] course; and Palmer Park, which includes a 9-hole golf course and CAMDEN Playground (an accessible play area, considered the largest accessible/integrated playground in the world and the most accessible/integrated playground). Most of the hiking and biking trails in the city are connected to the Ice Age Trail, which will eventually connect to the west with the [[Sugar River State Trail]], north to [[Milton, Wisconsin|Milton]] and [[Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin|Fort Atkinson]] and east to the [[Kettle Moraine State Forest]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ci.janesville.wi.us/index.aspx?page=303 Janesville Bicycle Trails]&lt;/ref&gt;

Janesville also has a nearly 500-acre greenbelt system to provide areas for surface water runoff and habitat for a diversity of plants and animals.

==Religion==
There are four [[Roman Catholic]] parishes in Janesville, all part of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Madison|Diocese of Madison]]. The oldest is St. Patrick's, established in a log chapel in 1844 when there were only six Catholic families in Janesville. St. Patrick's present church was built of cream colored brick in 1863 and is located at 315 Cherry Street. Located on a hill near the center of town, the architecturally prominent Nativity of Mary church (St. Mary's) was organized in 1876 by German immigrants who wanted a parish of their own.  The present red brick structure was completed in 1902. The remaining two Janesville parishes include St. John Vianney, located on East Racine Street, and St. William on the near west side.

The city is also home to many other Christian churches including [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]], [[Methodism|Methodist]], [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopalian]], [[Baptist]], [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] and others.  The [[Seventh Day Baptist]] General Conference has its offices in Janesville; the denomination's nearest church is in nearby [[Milton, Wisconsin|Milton]]. All Saints Anglican Catholic Church&lt;ref&gt;[http://anglicancatholic.kk5.org All Saints Anglican Catholic Church],&lt;/ref&gt; a part of the [[continuing Anglican]] movement, is located in a historic church near downtown that was built by German Lutherans in the 1880s.

There are three cemeteries in Janesville: Oakhill, a municipal cemetery, [[Mount Olivet Cemetery (Janesville)|Mount Olivet]], a [[Roman Catholic]] cemetery, and Milton Lawns, a non-demominational private cemetery.

The [[Gideon Bible]] organization was founded at the Janesville [[YMCA]] in 1899 by Janesville resident John H. Nicholson and a [[Beloit, Wisconsin|Beloit]] man after they had shared a [[Boscobel, Wisconsin|Boscobel]] hotel room.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gideons.org/Tgi.web/TGI.Web.PublicWebSite/pages/history.aspx The Gideons International&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports==
In fall 2009, Janesville became home to the [[Janesville Jets]], an expansion team in the [[North American Hockey League]], with games played at the [[Janesville Ice Arena]].  The [[Janesville Cubs]], a minor league baseball team affiliated with the [[Chicago Cubs]], was based in Janesville from 1941 to 1942 and 1946 to 1953.  They were called the Bears in 1946.

'''Evansville''' is a city in [[Rock County, Wisconsin|Rock County]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States]]. The population was 5,012 at the 2010 census.{{GR|2}}

==History==
Evansville was first settled in the 1830s by [[New England]]ers who were attracted to the area by its pristine wooded landscape and the placid Allen Creek. By 1855, the city recorded its first [[plat]] and was complete with homes, shops, and churches.

In 1863, the [[Chicago and North Western Railway]] came to Evansville, accelerating growth. At this point, Evansville's economy was based on industry and manufacturing of carriages, wagons, pumps, windmills and iron castings. The economy was also based on [[agriculture]]: dairying; farming (production of [[wheat]] and [[tobacco]]; and stock raising.

By the turn of the twentieth century Evansville had over 1900 residents, and by the 1920s, most of the buildings in Evansville's future Historic District were completed.

On November 11, 1918, [[Armistice Day]] activities celebrating the end of [[World War I]] took an ugly turn as some Evansville citizens began rounding up townspeople who they had deemed insufficiently supportive of the war, mainly due to their refusal or inability to buy [[Liberty bonds|war bonds]]. A German minister and his wife were apprehended on their way out of town before being brought downtown and forced to kiss the American flag. Other &quot;[[slacker]]s&quot; were made to wear sleighbells as they rode atop a car's radiator, while others were forced  to dance in a snake formation around a bonfire. A 73-year-old woman who passed on participating in the &quot;Your Share is Fair&quot; war bond campaign was dragged from her home by the mob, placed in a large animal cage and paraded about the streets before being parked before the fire. The woman, Mary J. Shaw, had previously bought bonds and supported the [[Red Cross]] and other war relief efforts. After refusing to salute or kiss the flag she was rescued by other citizens. Her attempts to see her assailants punished were brushed aside by the local sheriff, and testimony before the state legislature was similarly disregarded.

===Historic District===
[[File:Home of Andrews Family in Evansville Wisconsin Circa 1890(Websize-84k).jpg|thumb]]
The Evansville Historic District, which surrounds Main Street and stretches to the side streets of Garfield Avenue and Liberty Street, includes dozens of historic homes and other structures. The [[Wisconsin Historical Society]] called Evansville home to &quot;the finest collection of 1840s to 1915 architecture of any small town in Wisconsin&quot;.

The Eager Free Public Library building was built with the bequest of a leading citizen, Almeron Eager, in 1908.  Designed by the architectural firm of Claude and Starck of Madison, Wisconsin in the Prairie style, it features stained glass windows and plaster friezes just below the overhanging roof line. A 1994 addition at the rear of the original building was designed to match the original architecture, while adding much needed space and handicapped accessibility.  The intersection on which the library stands also contains a Greek Revival home (now a funeral parlor), a High Victorian Gothic brick home (now housing the local Masonic Temple) and a classic Victorian &quot;Painted Lady&quot; home, still a private residence.

The Evansville Seminary was located near College Drive in the district.  Its building was designed by architect [[August Kutzbock]].

In 1978, the historic district was placed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==
Evansville is located at {{Coord|42.779917|-89.300378|type:city_region:US|format=dms|display=inline}} (42.779917, -89.300378).{{GR|1}}

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|3.31|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which, {{convert|3.25|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.06|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.&lt;ref name =&quot;Gazetteer files&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evansville is located {{convert|23|mi|km}} south of [[Madison, Wisconsin]], {{convert|20|mi|km}} northwest of [[Janesville, Wisconsin]], and {{convert|40|mi|km}} northwest of [[Beloit, Wisconsin]].

===Lake Leota===
This {{convert|18|acre|m2|adj=on}} lake was formed by damming Allen Creek in the 1840s as a mill pond&lt;!--when?--&gt;. Because of erosion into Allen Creek from upstream farm fields and the resulting silt deposits that accumulated, Lake Leota had become shallower over the years, reaching an average depth of only one and a half feet by 2000. One major issue that faced the city in the last 30 years was how to restore the lake to its original depth. The dam was opened in September 2005 to allow the lake to drain and its bottom to dry out. There was some controversy in Evansville over the cost of dredging, so a referendum was put to the city's voters in November 2008.  It passed by almost two to one, and dredging to a maximum of ten-foot depth was completed in February 2009.  The dam was closed shortly thereafter, and Lake Leota was refilled slowly.  A ceremony to mark the renaissance of the lake was held on July 4, 2009.  Citizens can now enjoy the natural beauty of the lake, boating in non-powered craft, and fishing. Since refilling, the lake has been stocked with panfish and bass, and &quot;fish-cribs&quot; sunk below the lake surface to provide breeding areas and cover for small fry.

==Community==
Evansville has four gas stations, several banks, a full-sized grocery store, and several specialty shops and restaurants. Over the last two decades, many of the downtown buildings have been renovated in the style in which they were originally built. In addition, in 2008, three blocks of Main Street that had been covered with asphalt in the 1960s were re-paved with 1900-era paving bricks, adding to the &quot;old time&quot; feel of Main Street.  The re-paving took place when major utility improvements were made to the city's downtown infrastructure.

Evansville shares a fire department with several surrounding rural towns.  A new fire station was built in 2008 on Water Street.  The police department then moved into the remodeled former fire department building on Church Street. The Evansville EMS is housed separate from the fire department and is located on Church Street as well.

The community has a large central park, Leonard Park, on the shore of Lake Leota. Amenities include a baseball diamond with night lighting, a softball diamond, two tennis courts, a basketball court, a swimming pool, picnic shelters, and playgrounds. A skateboard facility was installed in 2006.  In addition, there are several smaller community parks, Countryside, Franklin, and Brzenski.  In 2008, a new large park was opened on Evansville's west side to accommodate the new subdivisions being built there.  The development of this park will take place over a number of years, but two full-size soccer fields and an extensive children's playground are in place. Plans include baseball diamonds, basketball courts and picnic shelters.

==Education==
The city has four schools: Levi Leonard Elementary, Theodore Robinson Intermediate School, J.C. McKenna Middle School, and Evansville High School. In 2005, Evansville High School earned a Blue Ribbon award from the United States Department of Education. The [[Blue Ribbon Schools Program|Blue Ribbons Schools]] program honors public and private K-12 schools that are academically superior in their states or that dramatically demonstrate superior gains in students achievements

The major employers in Evansville are: '''Baker Manufacturing Company''',a pump and well maker that has been producing quality water systems products under the Monitor brand for since 1873; '''Stoughton Trailers''', which builds [[semi-trailer]] chassis; '''Varco-Pruden''', which manufactures prefab metal buildings; ; '''Evansville Manor''', and the local nursing home.  Evansville has one home-town bank, Union Bank and Trust Company, which has been in business in Evansville for over a hundred years. Originally founded as the Grange Bank in 1897, it began offering trust services in 1940 and was renamed as Union Bank and Trust Company. UB&amp;T was featured on [[ABC Evening News]] with [[Charles Gibson]] in March 2009 as a flourishing small bank during the era of large-bank failures. The tracks of the former Chicago &amp; North Western railway remain, although a hollow shell of its former intricacy. The terminal included multiple spur, classification, and industrial tracks, to support a bustling local rail network, located between Water &amp; Main street crossings. In 1996 most of the multiple tracks remained, and the line was sold to Union Pacific railway. The new owners soon abandoned much of the areas trackage, including cutting off service north of town. Nearly all rail facilities in town were removed, including a fully functional system of CTC train signals, a fully functional railroad radio control and interlocking tower, and nearly all the trackage in town. The only rail service remains north east of town, serving Landmark Services Co-Op, since 2003.

==Politics==
On April 4, 2006, Evansville voters participated in two referenda, one to urge a pullout of U.S. troops from Iraq, and the second to gauge whether town residents supported &quot;our honorable President's leadership&quot; against &quot;the unfathomable wickedness of the forces of terror&quot;.  The first was approved but the second was rejected. While other Wisconsin communities were noted for holding referendums on the Iraq War, Evansville was the only one with two opposing referenda. Evansville received international attention with reporters from [[National Public Radio]], USA Today, and the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]].

==Media coverage==

'''Port Washington''' is the [[county seat]] of [[Ozaukee County, Wisconsin|Ozaukee County]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Wisconsin]]. The city is about 25 miles north of [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]] and 110 miles north of [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]]. The population was 11,250 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. The [[ZIP code]] is 53074.

==History==
The area that became Port Washington was originally inhabited by the Sauk tribe of Native Americans, and later explored by the [[French people|French]] in the late 17th century.  In 1835, General Wooster Harrison became the town's first permanent settler, in what he originally named &quot;Wisconsin City&quot;.  Harrison later renamed the town &quot;Washington&quot;.&lt;ref name=price&gt;Sister M. Jane Frances Price, S.S.N.S., ''The History of Port Washington, in Ozaukee County, Wisconsin'' (Ph.D. diss., De Paul University, 1943), pp. 7-8.&lt;/ref&gt;  Harrison's wife, Rhoda, was the first white settler to be buried in the town, when she died in 1837.&lt;ref&gt;Price, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1843 the name was changed to &quot;Sauk Washington&quot;.  The town of Port Washington was formed in January 1846 and until 1847 included the surrounding areas and what is currently [[Fredonia, Wisconsin|Fredonia]], [[Saukville]], and [[Belgium, Wisconsin|Belgium]].&lt;ref&gt;Price, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; The City of Port Washington was incorporated with its present name in 1882.

With a natural harbor at the mouth of Sauk Creek, the city became a [[sea port|port]] on [[Lake Michigan]].  The city exported cord wood, wheat and rye flour, bricks, and fish and hides, among other things.&lt;ref&gt;Price, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1843, the first religious services were held by the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]] in private homes. The first [[Catholic Church]] services were held in a similar manner in 1847.&lt;ref&gt;Price, pp. 32-33&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The Washington Democrat'', the town's first newspaper, was started in 1847 by Flavius J. Mills.&lt;ref&gt;Price, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;  The population reached 2,500 in 1853 and continued to increase, with an influx of [[immigrants]] from [[Germany]] and [[Luxembourg]] between 1853 and 1865.&lt;ref&gt;Price, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1870, the city saw major improvements in transportation.  Not only was the railroad approved to extend through [[Ozaukee County]], the harbor was substantially improved.&lt;ref&gt;Price, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[dredging]] that occurred resulted in the first man-made harbor in North America.&lt;ref&gt;Port Washington Chamber of Commerce 2008-2009 Visitor Guide&lt;/ref&gt;

J. M. Bostwick was instrumental in the opening of the Wisconsin Chair Factory in September 1888, the success of which allowed the town to flourish.&lt;ref&gt;Price, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Gilson Manufacturing Company started making garden tractors and tractor lawn mowers in 1894 and soon became the second largest business, after the Wisconsin Chair Factory.&lt;ref&gt;Price, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1896, Delos and Herbert Smith brought their commercial fishing business to Port Washington as that harbor afforded them the use of a steam powered fish tug.  There, the Smith family would call Port Washington home to their family business.  Smith Bros., as it was called, grew to a fleet of fishing tugs, fish wholesale, whitefish caviar, burbot oil, fish retail (markets), restaurants, and a hotel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christmaswhistler.web44.net/smithHistory/smithHistory.html Smith Bros. Family History]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1910 through 1935, Port Washington was the home of [[Paramount Records]] and other associated record labels. In 1940, the population was 4,046; 4,754 in 1950.

The [[Port Washington Generating Station|Port Washington power plant]] operated by Wisconsin Electric Power Company, now known as [[We Energies]] was established in the area.  In 1943 the company stated that the Port Washington Plant was &quot;the most efficient steam power plant in the world.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Price, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;  The coal-fired plant received shipments of coal primarily by lake boat from its beginnings in 1935 until 2004 when the coal-fired boilers were taken out of service. The plant has since been converted to generate electricity from natural gas.  The end of coal shipments also ended the use of Port Washington as a commercial port.  The harbor is now used almost exclusively by recreational boaters.

'''Greenfield''' is a city in [[Milwaukee County, Wisconsin|Milwaukee County]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States]]. The population was 36,720 at the 2010 census.

==History==
On March 8, 1839, the Town of Kinnikennick was created by the [[Wisconsin Territory|territorial legislature]], encompassing the western part of [[Lake, Milwaukee County, Wisconsin|the Town of Lake]]); and on December 20, 1839, the south portion of the Town of Kinnikennick was split off to form the town of [[Franklin, Milwaukee County, Wisconsin|Franklin]]. As of the 1840 [[United States Census|census]], the population of the Town of Kinnikennick or Kinnikinnick was 404.&lt;ref&gt;Watrous, Jerome Anthony. ''Memoirs of Milwaukee County: from the earliest historical times down to the present, including a genealogical and biographical record of representative families in Milwaukee County'', Chicago: Western Historical Association, 1909; Volume 1, pp. 68-69&lt;/ref&gt;

On Feb. 19, 1841, the name of the town was changed to Greenfield, taking its name from the name of the Post Office in the Town of Kinnickinnic. Greenfield was the final municipality in Milwaukee County to incorporate, and was the final municipality to leave the Town form of government in 1957. This was done to prevent total annexation by the City of [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]]. Before 1957, Milwaukee slowly nibbled away at Greenfield's land.&lt;ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=August 2010}} http://www.greenfieldlibrary.org/greenfield_history.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wausau''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|w|ɔː|s|ɔː}}&lt;ref&gt;{{USdict|wô′·sô}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a city in and the [[county seat]] of [[Marathon County, Wisconsin]], United States. The [[Wisconsin River]] divides the city into east and west. The city is adjacent to the [[Wausau (town), Wisconsin|town of Wausau]].

As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], Wausau had a population of 39,106.&lt;ref name=&quot;Census 2010&quot;&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://factfinder2.census.gov| title=Profile of General Population and Housing Characteristics: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (DP-1): Wausau city, Wisconsin| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau, American Factfinder| accessdate=September 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the core city of the Wausau [[Metropolitan Statistical Area]] (MSA), which includes all of Marathon County and had a population of 134,063 at the 2010 census.  The current Mayor of Wausau is Jim Tipple.

==History==
[[Image:Wasau-station-original.jpg|thumb|The original [[Milwaukee Road]] train station was used as a logo for Wausau Insurance companies starting in 1954; the logo used this angle.]]
[[Image:Frank-lloyd-wright-wausau.jpg|thumb|This [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]-designed house is one of two in the [[Andrew Warren Historic District]]. Several [[Prairie School]] houses are located in Wausau.]]

===Founding===
The [[Wisconsin River]] first drew settlers to the area during the mid-19th century. The area had been called &quot;Big Bull Flats&quot; or &quot;Big Bull Falls&quot; by the original French explorers&lt;ref name=history&gt;[http://www.ci.wausau.wi.us/Home/AboutWausau/HistoryofWausau.aspx History- The Wausau Story]&lt;/ref&gt; because the long rapids in the river created many bubbles, called ''bulle'' in French. A treaty with the [[Chippewa]] Indians in 1836 transferred land in the area to federal ownership. ''Wausau'' means &quot;a faraway place&quot; or &quot;a place which can be seen from far away&quot; in the [[Ojibwe language]].&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

George Stevens, who lent his name to [[Stevens Point, Wisconsin|Stevens Point]], a city south of Wausau, began processing the pine forests into [[lumber]] in 1840. Other sawmills along the Wisconsin River began to spring up.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; By 1846, [[Walter McIndoe]] arrived and took the lead in the local business and community. His efforts helped, in part, to establish [[Marathon County, Wisconsin|Marathon County]] in 1850.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

===Early settlers===
By 1852, Wausau had been established as a [[Political subdivisions of Wisconsin#Town|town]] and continued to grow and mature. German immigration into the area brought more people, and by 1861, the settlement was incorporated as a village.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

Churches, schools, industry and social organizations began to flourish, with the state granting the city a charter in 1872, and with elections held the first Tuesday in April.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

The residents elected A. Kickbusch as their first mayor in 1874.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; Five years earlier, Kickbusch had returned to his homeland of Germany and brought back with him 702 people, all of whom are believed to have settled in the Wausau area. Kickbusch founded the A. Kickbusch Wholesale Grocery Company, a family business carried on by his grandson, August Kickbusch II. In 1917, August Kickbusch II purchased a modest, four-square-style house at 513 Grant Street,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wausaulaw.com/Eaton_John_Overbey_Office.html Kickbusch house]&lt;/ref&gt; and undertook massive renovations, adding two [[sun room]]s, arcaded windows, a tiled [[porch]] in the Mediterranean style, a formal classical entrance, and ornate custom-designed [[chimney]] crowns. The home is on the national register of historic places as part of the [[Andrew Warren Historic District]].

When the railroad arrived in 1874, Wausau was even more accessible to settlers and industry, which was still mostly focused on lumber. This allowed the city to continue to grow and flourish, even as other villages and towns in the area declined because of the rapidly vanishing forests and closing of the [[lumber mill]]s.

===Twentieth century===
[[File:2009-0620-Wausau-GrandTheater.jpg|thumb|left|The Grand Theater, built in 1927, replaced the Grand Opera House (1899).]]

Wausau's favorable location on the Wisconsin River was partly responsible for the city's survival. The economy was diversified in the early 20th century, led by an the insurance group Employers Insurance of Wausau, now a part of [[Liberty Mutual]]. Its logo, first introduced in 1954, was the downtown [[The Milwaukee Road|Milwaukee Road]] railroad depot, which was set against the backdrop of the community's skyline.

The [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] had a major effect on the Wausau area. Many industries were forced to cut back by laying off and dismissing workers or by closing altogether.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; After decades of growth, the city virtually ground to a halt. However, under the [[New Deal]], Wausau was significantly modernized. After [[World War II]], the city once again continued to grow in industry, education, recreation, and retail, more than in population.

After the [[fall of Saigon]], [[Hmong people|Hmong]] refugees from Southeast Asia who fought alongside the [[CIA]] immigrated into Wausau at the end of the 1970s. Wausau church organizations (Catholic and [[Lutheran]]) helped [[Hmong people|Hmong]] refugees adapt to American life.

[[File:2009-0620-WI017-Wausau-400block.jpg|thumb|right|The 400 Block in downtown Wausau]]
In 1983, the [[Wausau Center]] shopping mall opened. By the mid-to-late-1990s, the city of Wausau began to purchase and develop parts of West Industrial Park to meet the needs of the expanding economy and companies. In the late 1990s, the city demolished a number of aging buildings on a square in the center of downtown, creating what is known locally at the 400 Block, an open, grassy block with paved sidewalks crossing it. The square is a focal point for summer festivals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waow.com/Global/story.asp?S=12637559 Wausau's summer events season kicks off.]&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years Wausau has redone the 400 Block, adding a permanent stage and other renovations that in total cost $2 million.

===The new millennium===
By the end of the 20th century, Wausau began to implement the Wausau Central Business District Master Plan,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ci.wausau.wi.us/is/wpl/pdf/masterplan.pdf Wausau Central Business District Master Plan]&lt;/ref&gt; which included redevelopment and economic restructuring of downtown Wausau. The tallest commercial building in Wisconsin outside of Milwaukee is located in Wausau, the 241-foot [[Dudley tower]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.emporis.com/building/first-wausau-tower-wausau-wi-usa&lt;/ref&gt; Significant school construction in recent years has occurred in response to changing demographics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.numbersusa.com/interests/ordeal.html school construction]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
On December 20, 1839, the south portion of the [[Greenfield, Wisconsin|Town of Kinnikennick]] was split off to form the town of Franklin. As of the 1840 [[United States Census|census]], the population of the Town of Franklin was 248.&lt;ref&gt;Watrous, Jerome Anthony. ''Memoirs of Milwaukee County: from the earliest historical times down to the present, including a genealogical and biographical record of representative families in Milwaukee County'', Chicago: Western Historical Association, 1909; Volume 1, pp. 68-69&lt;/ref&gt; The name “Franklin” was given in homage to one of the Founding Fathers, [[Benjamin Franklin]]. Franklin was organized into a township in 1841. The township consisted of a thirty-six-mile area that was originally covered with heavy timber, which was mostly hardwoods such as hickory, walnut, and butternut. Most of the town's drainage was delivered by the Root River and there was an abundance of wildlife including bears, deer, and wolves.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.franklinhistory.net/Franklin Historical Society&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1950s, Franklin was known as a “City of homes” for its growing residential areas, which served as a suburb of the city of [[Milwaukee]]. In 1956, town officials were alarmed by the possibility that the City of Milwaukee might attempt to annex portions of Franklin. In response, the town was officially incorporated as a fourth-class city on August 15, 1956. Franklin is bounded by the City of [[Oak Creek, Wisconsin|Oak Creek]] to the east, the villages of [[Greendale, Wisconsin|Greendale]] and Hales Corners to the north, the county of [[Racine, Wisconsin|Racine]] to the south, and the county of [[Waukesha, Wisconsin|Waukesha]] to the west.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.franklinwi.gov/display/router.aspx?DocID=73City of Franklin&lt;/ref&gt;  The city of Milwaukee lies adjacent to the Franklin city limits in the northeast.

===Public===
The majority of Franklin students, grades kindergarten through 12th grade, attend the [[Franklin Public School District]]. The Franklin Public School District was formed in 1962 as a K - 12 common school district. Franklin has five elementary schools, one middle school and one high school.

City government exercises no fiscal control over a school district.

The [[Oak Creek-Franklin School District]], primarily of Franklin's eastern neighbor, Oak Creek, is a separate school district from that of the Franklin Public School District and serves residents of the far eastern side of Franklin, along 27th street. In some places it can go as far as a mile and a half mile West into the Franklin city limits. The District also serves all of the City of Oak Creek.

The [[Whitnall School District]], which serves primarily the neighboring Village of Hales Corners and parts of the City of Greenfield, serves the City of Franklin residents residing on the city's far Northwest side.

==Environmental concerns==
Franklin is home to one of the [[Environmental Protection Agency]]'s [[Superfund]] sites. Referred to as the &quot;Fadrowski Drum Disposal Site&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/superfund/sites/npl/nar729.htm&lt;/ref&gt; or FDDS, the {{convert|40|acre|m2|adj=on}} site located at {{coord|42.920587|-87.9528584|format=dms|display=inline}} 6865 South 27th Street is one of many sites across the United States that contain, or once contained substantial amounts of contamination and [[hazardous wastes]]. The FDDS was found to be contaminated with high amounts of [[lead]] and [[chromium]]. Trace amounts of [[arsenic]] and [[DDT]] were also found.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/R5Super/npl/wisconsin/WID980901227.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The site also contains levels of [[mercury (element)|mercury]] above Wisconsin Enforcement Standards.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/superfund/sites/rods/fulltext/r0591164.pdf#SSC&lt;/ref&gt; The site once included a man-made pond with elevated [[cyanide]] levels. The exact amount of drums contained on the site, and their contents, is not known. The site was placed on the National Priorities list in 1986, with Remedial Action (RA) completed in 1994. The site was deleted from the National Priorities List in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/superfund/sites/npl/d050906.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Overview of the Fadrowski Drum Disposal Site ===
For over a decade, beginning in 1970, the Fadrowski Drum Disposal Site was operated by Edward J. Fadrowski as an unlicensed waste site thought to be accepting standard landfill debris. The site illegally accepted an unknown amount of hazardous waste during its time of operation. In 1983, Menard, Inc. purchased land that included the site with the intention of building a [[Menards]] store. During excavation for fill to level the grade for the store, several buried drums were uncovered. Some drums ruptured, spilling their unknown (at the time) contents. One drum exploded,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/HAC/pha/fadrowski/fdd_p1.html&lt;/ref&gt; prompting a call to the Franklin Fire Department, who in turn notified the [[Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources]]. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ultimately oversaw the containment of the site. The site remedies include restricting access to the site, restricting use of land at the site, limited excavation of the waste (some drums), removal of hazardous soil, monitoring ground water, monitoring surface water, and installing a landfill cap.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/region5/sites/fadrowski/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Current status of the Fadrowski Drum Disposal Site ===
[[Image:SuperfundFadrowskiDrumDisposal20120104.jpg|thumb|Fadrowski Drum Disposal EPA Superfund Site with Dental Associates facility in background]]
Presently, the site has been largely remediated via landfill and limited excavation, however &quot;waste material above health-based levels will be left on site&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/superfund/sites/rods/fulltext/r0591164.pdf#SRRA&lt;/ref&gt; (drums, some with unknown contents, still remain buried to this day). Although Remedial Action was completed in 1994, the site is currently under a monitoring status. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is reviewing the site every five years, the last review was conducted in July 2008.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/superfund/sites/fiveyear/f2008050002658.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; When viewed, the site appears largely as a field with a slightly higher elevation (due to the landfill cap) than the surrounding land. It is surrounded by a [[barbed wire]] fence. The site is now encircled by development. It is bordered on the north by an [[Ashley Furniture HomeStore]], which now occupies the building of the original Menard's store when the site was discovered. The Menard's store has relocated across South 27th Street, but Menard, Inc. still owns the land. A [[tributary]] that flows into the [[Root River (Wisconsin)|Root River]] is a few hundred feet west of the site, and South 27th Street is approximately {{convert|250|ft|m}} to the east. In 2001, the EPA relaxed deed restrictions on land intended to be a &quot;buffer&quot; around the site. The southern border of the site is now lined with recently built [[Goodwill Industries]] and [[Gander Mountain]] retail stores. In September 2011, a Dental Associates facility opened on the outlot sold by Menard, Inc. along the eastern border (sharing approximately {{convert|50|ft|m}} of the eastern border) of the site. Single-family homes are just {{convert|1000|ft|m}} west of the site, and multi-family units are just {{convert|600|ft|m}} to the south. A [[Wal-Mart]] is just {{convert|600|ft|m}} north of the site. The site itself is prohibited (via Declaration of Restriction #6778720 to Menard's Inc.) from ever being used for [[potable water]], residential development, or any development that would disturb the landfill cap. These restrictions essentially ensure no development will ever take place on the land.

===Airport===
Sheboygan is served by the [[Sheboygan County Memorial Airport]], which is located several miles from the city.

===Roads===
[[Interstate 43]] is the primary north-south transportation route into Sheboygan, and forms the west boundary of the city. [[U.S. Route 141]] was the primary north-south route into Sheboygan before Interstate 43 was built, and its former route is a major north-south route through the center of the city that is referred to as Calumet Drive coming into the city from the north, and South Business Drive from the south; between Superior and Georgia Avenues, the highway is known as 14th Street. Four-lane [[Wisconsin Highway 23|Highway 23]] is the primary west route into the city, and leads into the city up to North 25th Street as a freeway. Other state highways in the city include [[Wisconsin Highway 42|Highway 42]], [[Wisconsin Highway 28|Highway 28]], which both run mostly along the former inner-city routing of U.S. 141. Secondary county highways include County LS to the north; Counties J, O, PP, and EE to the west; and County KK to the south.

=== Commuter transit ===
[[Shoreline Metro]] provides public transit throughout the city as well as [[Kohler, Wisconsin|Kohler]] and [[Sheboygan Falls, Wisconsin|Sheboygan Falls]]. All routes depart from the Metro Center, more known as the &quot;Transfer Point&quot; located in the downtown.

[[Jefferson Lines]] and [[Indian Trails]] serve Sheboygan at the Metro Center providing transportation to [[Milwaukee]] and [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]].

=== Cycling and walking facilities ===
The city and Sheboygan County have been working in the last few years to expand the availability of [[Segregated cycle facilities|bike lanes]] on existing roads and dedicated asphalt shared use [[trail|walking]] and [[bike path]]s in the city, with one existing along the Highway 23 corridor leading to the Old Plank Road Trail to the west of Sheboygan using dedicated paths and bike lanes, and to the city's path along the lakefront north of the river on the east. A 2013 project created a north-south trail using the former right-of-way of the inner line of the [[Chicago and North Western Transportation Company|Chicago &amp; Northwestern Railroad]] through the city between Martin and Pennsylvania Avenues in a [[rail trail|rail to trail]] conversion with future expansion planned, along with a north path along the reconstructed Eisner Avenue. Other eventual plans include paths along the Taylor Drive corridor, and improvements to the south to allow connection to the [[Ozaukee Interurban Trail]].

===Space===
{{Main|Spaceport Sheboygan}}
Since 1995 Sheboygan has been the site of {{convert|8|and|20|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} rocket launches for a local high school program called [http://www.rockets4schools.org/ Rockets for Schools]. Sheboygan is also the site of a proposed new [[spaceport]] called Spaceport Sheboygan.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water===
Sheboygan is bounded on the east by [[Lake Michigan]]. There are no active ports in the city. The current site of [[Blue Harbor Resort]] sits on a [[peninsula]] between the lake and the Sheboygan River's last bend that was formerly used by the C. Reiss Coal Company (now a [[Koch Industries]] division) as their headquarters and base of operations, where ships would load and unload [[coal]] along the peninsula.

The [[Sheboygan River]] also passes through the city, but dams upstream in [[Sheboygan Falls, Wisconsin|Sheboygan Falls]] prevent navigation, while tall-masted boats are confined to the river downstream of the Pennsylvania Avenue bridge. Commercial charter fishing boats dock near the mouth of the river.

==Media==
The city's only daily newspaper is ''[[The Sheboygan Press]]'', which has been published since 1907. The free papers ''The Sheboygan Sun'' and ''The Beacon'' are each mailed weekly to area residents and feature classified ads and other local content.

As Sheboygan is located mid-way between Green Bay and Milwaukee, residents of the city can choose from television and radio stations originating within each of those areas. [[A. C. Nielsen]] places Sheboygan within the Milwaukee market, although Green Bay stations also report news, events, and weather warnings pertaining to Sheboygan and target the city with advertising.

[[Arbitron]] places Sheboygan and Sheboygan County within one radio market, and several stations serve the area. [[Midwest Communications]] owns four stations within the county, including [[talk radio|talk]] station [[WHBL (AM)|WHBL]] (1330); [[country music|country]] station [[WBFM]] (93.7); [[contemporary hit radio|CHR/Top 40]] [[WXER]] (104.5 from Plymouth, with a [[broadcast translator|translator station]] on 96.1 in Sheboygan); and [[active rock]] [[WHBZ]] (106.5), all of which transmit from a three-tower site on Sheboygan's south side. [[Fox Sports Radio]] affiliate [[WCLB]] (950) also serves the city, along with the Sheboygan Area School District's [[WSHS (FM)|WSHS]] (91.7), a member of the [[Wisconsin Public Radio]] Ideas Network, and Plymouth's [[WJUB]] (1420), a [[adult standards|standards]] station. [[WRVM|WYVM]] signed on in December 2012 licensed to Sheboygan from a temporary tower in Howards Grove on 90.9, acting as a full-power relay of [[Suring, Wisconsin|Suring]]'s WRVN (102.7), which has a religious teaching format.

Various [[Christian radio|religious]] stations originating from north of Green Bay and Milwaukee via low-power [[broadcast translator|translator stations]], including a translator for Kiel's [[WSTM (FM)|WSTM]] (91.3), and [[NOAA Weather Radio All Hazards|NOAA Weather Radio]] station [[WWG91]], all broadcast from a tower north of Superior Avenue along the west side of Interstate 43.

The city is served by [[Charter Communications]] and [[AT&amp;T U-verse]] with [[public-access television]] [[cable TV]] programming provided to both systems from &quot;WSCS&quot; (Channels 95/990 on Charter, 99 on U-verse). The city formerly had one licensed television station, [[WPVS-LP]], which is currently off the air due to the digital switchover. In 2011, the station was re-licensed to Milwaukee as a future ethnic broadcaster, and the station's new transmitter in Milwaukee will not reach Sheboygan with service. Channel 28 was reserved for the city in the analog age, but was never utilized by any broadcaster outside of an abandoned construction permit for a television sister to WHBL in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=FCC Internet Services Staff |url=http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/call_hist.pl?Facility_id=60044&amp;Callsign=DWHBL-TV |title=FCC record of deleted station WHBL-TV |publisher=Licensing.fcc.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marinette''' is a city in and the [[county seat]] of [[Marinette County, Wisconsin|Marinette County]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States]].{{GR|6}} It is located on the bay of [[Green Bay (Lake Michigan)|Green Bay]], part of [[Lake Michigan]]; to the north is the [[Menominee River]], and in between is Stephenson Island.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marinette.wi.us/tourism_and_recreation/index.php Tourism and Recreation]&lt;/ref&gt;

Marinette is the principal city of the Marinette, WI&amp;ndash;[[Michigan|MI]] [[Marinette micropolitan area|Micropolitan Statistical Area]], which includes all of Marinette County, Wisconsin and [[Menominee County, Michigan|Menominee County]], Michigan. The population was 10,968 at the [[United States Census, 2010|2010 census]].

==Name==
[[File:MarinetteWisconsinSign.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Welcome sign]]
The name ''Marinette'' comes from the name of an early fur trader's common-law wife, [[Marie Antoinette Chevalier]] (1784, Langlade County – 1865, Green Bay). She was a French-Native American woman who ran a trading post located near the mouth of the [[Menominee River]] and came to be known as &quot;Queen Marinette.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~wimarine/queen.html RootsWeb: A Mini-Biography of Queen Marinette]&lt;/ref&gt; After her death, she was buried in [[Allouez, Wisconsin|Allouez]]. Chevalier was reinterred in a sarcophagus at the Forest Home Mausoleum in Marinette in 1987. Her original tombstone is on display at the museum on [[Stephenson Island (Wisconsin)|Stephenson Island]] in Marinette.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ehextra.com/main.asp?SectionID=12&amp;SubSectionID=35&amp;ArticleID=7404&amp;TM=235.964 &quot;Remembering a queen: New floral display graces Queen Marinette’s tomb&quot;], EH Extra&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:2009-0619-Marinette-Court.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Marinette County Courthouse]]
[[File:2009-0619-Marinette-library.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Stephenson Public Library]]
[[File:2009-0619-Marinette-DunlapSquare.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Dunlap Square Building]] in downtown, listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]]]
Marinette was first settled by a small Algonquin tribe, known as &quot;the wild rice people&quot;, consisting of 40 to 80 men. They lived on the mouth of the Menominee River in the 17th and 18th century. In the 19th century, the settlement became a French fur trading post. The first white settler was Stanislaus Chappu, also known as Chappee. In the late 19th century the city experienced a lumber boom because of its location along the [[Menominee River]] and next to [[Green Bay (Lake Michigan)|Green Bay]]. Although lumbering trailed off at the start of the 20th century, the town has continued to take advantage of its position along those bodies of water, with a major paper mill ([[Kimberly Clark]]), and other plants such as [[Marinette Marine]], a shipyard owned by the Italian firm, Fincantieri; [[Ansul|Ansul/Tyco]], a manufacturer of fire protection systems; [[ThyssenKrupp|ThyssenKrupp Waupaca Foundry]], KS Kolbenschmidt US Inc. formerly known as Karl Schmidt Unisia, Inc.,&lt;ref&gt;[http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=4245207 Karl Schmidt Unisia, Inc.]&lt;/ref&gt; cast and machined automotive parts; and [[Silvan Industries]], a manufacturer of pressure vessels and part of the Samuel Pressure Vessel Group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.samuelpressurevesselgroup.com Samuel Pressure Vessel Group]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hudson''' is a city in [[St. Croix County, Wisconsin|St. Croix County]], [[Wisconsin]],  [[United States]]. As of the [[2010 United States census]], its population was 12,719. It is part of the [[Minneapolis–St. Paul]] [[Metropolitan Statistical Area]] (MSA). The village of [[North Hudson, Wisconsin|North Hudson]] is located directly to the north of Hudson.

==History==
[[File:2009-0620-Hudson-Octagon.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The [[John S. Moffat House|Octagon House Museum]], listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], was built in 1855.]]

Hudson was settled in the summer of 1840 by Louis Massey and his brother in-law, Peter Bouchea. William Steets arrived at about the same time. Later that same year, Joseph Sauperson (commonly known as Joe LaGrue) took up residence. These four are considered Hudson's original inhabitants. Massey and Bouchea settled at the mouth of the Willow River, near the present-day First and St. Croix Streets. They had been part of the group who lived for some time along the river below [[Fort Snelling]], which appears on some old maps as &quot;Massey's Landing&quot;. The 1840s saw a few settlers making their appearance here &amp;mdash; Captain John Page, the Nobles brothers, Dr. Philip Aldrich, Ammah Andrews, Moses Perrin, Colonel James Hughes, Daniel Anderson, and others.

Hudson was originally called Willow River. It was later named Buena Vista by Judge [[Joel Foster]], founder of [[River Falls, Wisconsin|River Falls]], after returning from the Mexican War where he fought in the [[Battle of Buena Vista]]. In 1852, Alfred D. Gray, Hudson's first mayor, petitioned to change the name of the city to &quot;Hudson&quot;, because the bluffs along the [[St. Croix River (Wisconsin–Minnesota)|St. Croix River]] reminded him of the [[Hudson River]] in his native [[New York]].

A large number of settlers arrived in the 1850s and 1860s, many of whom were ancestors of today's residents. The lumber industry was the prime attraction of the area, and over time sawmills were established throughout the [[St. Croix River (Wisconsin-Minnesota)|St. Croix]] Valley.

[[U.S. Highway 12]] once crossed the St. Croix River on a toll bridge between Wisconsin and Minnesota, which provided revenue for the town. With the construction of [[Interstate 94]], the toll bridge was removed, though the long [[causeway]] extending to the former bridge location is now open to the public as a pedestrian walkway.

Hudson has grown as a tourist destination in recent years with shops and restaurants on the St. Croix in its historic downtown, along with hotels and other businesses that serve traffic on Interstate Highway 94.

Hudson was home to a greyhound racing track, St. Croix Meadows, which closed in 2001 and now sits empty.

===Climate===
Two Rivers, Wisconsin lies within the [[Humid continental climate|Humid Continental]] climate zone, modified by its close proximity to Lake Michigan. This gives the city more moderate temperatures and lesser extremes compared to its inland counterparts. The lake influence also gives Two Rivers a greater seasonal lag than places farther away from the lakeshore, with warmer Septembers and cooler Marches than the rest of the state; for instance, September, with a mean temperature of {{convert|60|°F|0|abbr=on}} is only 1 degree Fahrenheit cooler than June's {{convert|61|°F|0|abbr=on}}, whereas [[Oshkosh, Wisconsin]], a few tens of miles inland at a similar latitude, has a September that is 8 degrees Fahrenheit cooler than June.

The [[Köppen climate classification|Köppen classification]] for the town is ''Dfb'', often described as a [[Humid continental climate#Dfb/Dwb/Dsb: Warm summer subtype|Warm Summer Humid Continental]] climate, characterized by the coldest month's mean being below {{convert|-3|°C|0|abbr=on}}, the persistent snowpack line, and with 4 or more months above {{convert|10|°C|0|abbr=on}}, but no month above {{convert|22|°C|0|abbr=on}}.

==Ice cream sundae==
{{main|Sundae}}
There is a heated debate between [[Ithaca, New York]] and Two Rivers over which city has the right to claim the title &quot;birthplace of the ice cream [[sundae]].&quot; When [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]] mayor [[Carolyn K. Peterson]] proclaimed a day to celebrate her city as the birthplace of the sundae, she received postcards from Two Rivers' citizens reiterating that town's claim.&lt;ref&gt;Laura Zaichkin, &quot;Sundae wars continue between Ithaca and Two Rivers,&quot; ''Ithaca Journal'', June 30, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Ithaca retaliated with an ad called &quot;Got Proof?&quot; in the Two Rivers newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanprofile.com/article/22682.html The Ice Cream Sundae – The American Profile]&lt;/ref&gt;

Two Rivers' claim is based on the story of George Hallauer asking Edward C. Berners, the owner of Berners' Soda Fountain, to drizzle chocolate syrup over ice cream in 1881. Berners eventually did and wound up selling the treat for a nickel, originally only on Sundays, but later every day. According to this story, the spelling changed when a glass salesman ordered canoe-shaped dishes. When Berners died in 1939, the ''Chicago Tribune'' headlined his obituary &quot;Man Who Made First Ice Cream Sundae Is Dead.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Two Rivers Economic Development&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;obit&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title = Man Who Made First Ice Cream Sundae Is Dead | work = Chicago Daily Tribune | pages = 1  | publisher = Chicago Tribune | date = 1939-07-02 | accessdate = 2007-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional football==
During the 1930s and 40s, Two Rivers was home to training camps for numerous professional football teams. The city's cool weather, athletic facilities, and general hospitality of the town's people helped lure the teams. Washington High School, The J.E. Hamilton Community House, and Walsh Field were used for practices and meetings, while teams stayed at the Hamilton Hotel. The teams included the now defunct [[Columbus Bullies]] [[American Football League|AFL]] in 1940 and the [[Chicago Rockets]] [[All-America Football Conference|AAFC]] in 1947. Two Rivers also hosted the [[National Football League]]'s [[Pittsburgh Steelers|Pittsburgh Pirates]], now known as the Pittsburgh Steelers, in 1939 and the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] in 1941 and 1942.&lt;ref&gt;http://www3.jsonline.com/packer/news/jul00/cheese30072900.asp?format=print&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eau Claire''' is a city located in the west-central part of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Wisconsin]]. The population was 65,883 as of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 U.S. Census]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/55/5522300.html]&lt;/ref&gt; making it the 9th largest city in the state. It is the [[county seat]] of [[Eau Claire County, Wisconsin|Eau Claire County]],{{GR|6}} although a small portion of the city lies in neighboring [[Chippewa County, Wisconsin|Chippewa County]]. The Eau Claire County portion had a population of 63,902 inhabitants, while the Chippewa County portion was only 1,981 inhabitants. Eau Claire is the principal city of the Eau Claire, Wisconsin [[United States metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]], which is a part of the Eau-Claire-Menomonie [[Combined Statistical Area]].

== Name origin ==
&quot;Eau Claire&quot; is the singular form of the original [[French language|French]] name, &quot;Eaux Claires&quot;, meaning &quot;Clear Waters&quot;, for the [[Eau Claire River (Chippewa River)|Eau Claire River]].  According to local legend, the river was so named because early [[French people|French]] explorers journeying down the rain-muddied [[Chippewa River (Wisconsin)|Chippewa River]], happened upon the Eau Claire River, excitedly exclaiming &quot;Voici l'eau claire!&quot;  (&quot;Here [is] clear water!&quot;), the city motto, which appears on the city seal.  The name is pronounced as if it were spelled &quot;O'Clare&quot;.
&lt;!--FOR HISTORY: (Prior to 1856, Eau Claire County was Chippewa County's &quot;Town of Clearwater&quot;.  The name &quot;Eau Claire&quot; was taken when the county was separated from Chippewa County.){{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}--&gt;

Eau Claire is the [[Horseradish]] Capital of the World&lt;ref name=EpodunkFood&gt;[http://www.epodunk.com/slogans/food.html Claims to Fame - Food], [[Epodunk]], accessed April 16, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and the [http://volumeone.org/news/1/posts/2011/12/14/2826_Welcome_to_the_Kubb_Capitol_of_North_America Kubb Capital of North America], as, among other things kubb related, it annually hosts the [http://www.usakubb.org/ U.S. National Kubb Championship].

==Geography==
[[Image:Eau Claire Wisconsin-Water Street Looking East 2006-2.jpg|thumb|Water St.]]
Eau Claire is located at {{Coord|44|49|N|91|30|W|type:city}}, (44.8146, −91.4927){{GR|1}} approximately 90 miles (145&amp;nbsp;km) east of [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]] and [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul, Minnesota]]. The city is located on the northern fringes of the [[Driftless Zone]].

The city was founded near the confluence of the [[Eau Claire River (Chippewa River)|Eau Claire]] and [[Chippewa River (Wisconsin)|Chippewa]] rivers as three separate settlements. The main section of downtown is on the site of the original village, where [[McCann_brothers#Stephen_Smith_McCann|Stephen McCann]], in partnership with J. C. Thomas, put up three buildings in 1845. Although these structures were erected to establish a claim to the land they stood on, the McCann family moved into one of them and became the first permanent settlers.&lt;ref name='HOME'&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Bailey | first1 = William F. | title = History of Eau Claire County Wisconsin, 1914, Past and Present | chapter = Chapter 40 - Hotels of Eau Claire | work = The Hart House | publisher = C.

Between a mile and a half and two miles downstream, the Daniel Shaw &amp; Co. lumber company founded Shawtown, which was annexed by the 1930s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} By the 1950s, the entire city had spread far enough to the east to adjoin [[Altoona, Wisconsin|Altoona]].
&lt;!-- the fact template above is to ascertain the exact date, so we can copy-edit the clumsy &quot;by the 1930s&quot; to &quot;in the 19x0s&quot; /Xavexgoem  --&gt;

The Chippewa Valley, especially Eau Claire, has groups and performers in the indie rock, metal/hardcore, hip hop, jam, and jazz genres. Bands such as [[Bon Iver]], Laarks, The Daredevil Christopher Wright, Adelyn Rose, and Softly Dear have achieved varying levels of national success. Pop-punk has created a following in the Eau Claire area, and hip-hop artists also claim Eau Claire as their homeland.

[http://ambledown.com Amble Down], an Eau Claire based record label has released many local albums by bands such as [http://www.myspace.com/thedaredevilchristoperwright The Daredevil Christopher Wright], [http://sneezingcow.com/music/ Michael Perry and the Long Beds], Meridene, The Gentle Guest, The Cloud Hymn, [http://wearethewillows.com We Are The Willows] and Cranes &amp; Crows.

Eau Claire is also home to one of the best jazz programs in the nation.  Its top university jazz ensemble has been awarded the prestigious &quot;DownBeat Magazine Award&quot; for best college jazz ensemble in the nation six times, the most recent being in 2010.  The community also hosts the Eau Claire Jazz Festival, which has been in existence since 1968.

Popular destinations for live music in the Chippewa Valley include: The State Theatre, The Grand Little Theater, The House of Rock, Infinitea Teahouse, Phoenix Park, The Acoustic Cafe, The Mousetrap, The Cabin and Higherground on the UWEC Campus, Hoffy's Skate America, and the [[Sarge Boyd Bandshell]] in [[Owen Park (Eau Claire, Wisconsin)|Owen Park]] where the Eau Claire Municipal Band presents free family-oriented programming throughout the summer.

The Eau Claire Male Chorus was formed in 1946 and has performed two concerts each year since it started. They perform a Christmas Concert in December and a special themed concert each Spring in April or May. In 2011 they started a dinner concert. Every 5 years they host an Inter-Regional Big Sing concert for the Association of Male Choruses of America with a combined mass chorus of about 400 men. In addition they travel to other areas to perform in concerts, sing at local nursing homes and churches.

==History==
Originally called '''Fulton Station,''' Edgerton was named after a 19th-century businessman, [[Elisha W. Edgerton]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&amp;term_id=3477&amp;search_term=edgerton Edgerton (Origin of Placename)]&lt;/ref&gt; or his brother [[Benjamin Hyde Edgerton]], a civil engineer.&lt;ref&gt;'Wisconsin Magazine of History,' vol. 4, Wisconsin Historical Society; 1921, Biographical Sketch of Benjamin Hyde Edgerton, pg. 354-357&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1886, Catholic parents in Edgerton protested the reading of the [[Authorized King James Version|King James Bible]] in the village schools because they considered the [[Douay-Rheims Bible|Douay]] version the correct translation. The school board argued that Catholic children could ignore the Bible readings or sit in the cloak room while the rest of the children listened to the reading of a Protestant version of the Bible. Because the school board refused to change their policy, several families brought suit on the grounds that the schools' practice conflicted with the Wisconsin Constitution, which forbade sectarian instruction in the public schools.

The circuit court rejected their argument, deciding in 1888 that the readings were not sectarian because both translations were of the same work. The parents appealed their case to the Wisconsin Supreme Court, which on March 18, 1890, overruled the circuit court, concluding that reading the Bible did, in fact, constitute sectarian instruction, and thus illegally united the functions of church and state.

Seventy years later, when the U.S. Supreme Court banned prayer from the public schools in 1963, the [[Edgerton Bible Case]] was one of the precedents cited by Justice William Brennan.&lt;ref&gt;Source: Geiger, John O. &quot;The Edgerton Bible Case: Humphrey Desmond's Political Education of Wisconsin Catholics,&quot; ''Journal of Church and State'', vol. 20. no. 1 (1978): 13-27; U.S. Reports 374 U.S. 203, pp. 282 &amp; 292.]&lt;/ref&gt;

At one time, there were as many as forty tobacco [[warehouse]]s dotting the streets of Edgerton.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} [[Queen Anne style architecture in the United States|Queen Anne style]] mansions along Edgerton's Washington Street testify to the [[wealth]] and prominence some merchants once had. The 1890s Carlton Hotel, once located on Henry Street, also once served as an additional reminder of the tobacco industry's influence. Although built by a [[brewery|brewing firm]], the hotel (which burned to the ground in the 1990s) was frequented by tobacco buyers and sellers.

Beyond its connection to author [[Sterling North]]'s boyhood and its onetime place as Wisconsin's premiere tobacco city, Edgerton's other major claim to fame is its association with [[Pauline Jacobus]]. Jacobus and her husband, [[Oscar Jacobus]], were responsible for the first artistic [[pottery]] created in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] in the mid-1880s. By 1888, the couple had moved their business to Edgerton. Although Oscar's death and an [[depression (economics)|economic depression]] disrupted the business in the 1890s, Pauline Jacobus continued making pottery in Edgerton until the early 1900s' fire that destroyed her rural Edgerton home, &quot;The Bogart&quot;. Much admired and sought-after as an American art form, &quot;Pauline Pottery&quot; is recognized in antique and art galleries throughout the world. A [[log home|log cabin]] from the old Bogart site and the [[factory]] warehouse where Pauline Pottery was first made in Edgerton still survive.

The Pomeroy and Pelton Tobacco Warehouse, known as the T. W. Dickinson &amp; Son Tobacco Warehouse after it was purchased by Weetman Dickinson, is on the National Register of Historic Places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nrhp.focus.nps.gov/natregsearchresult.do?fullresult=true&amp;recordid=98|title=Pomeroy and Pelton Tobacco Warehouse|publisher=National Register of Historic Places|accessdate=2009-07-05}} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/ahi/detailrecord.asp|title=Pomeroy and Pelton Tobacco Warehouse|publisher=Wisconsin Architecture &amp; History Inventory|accessdate=2009-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the oldest free-standing brick warehouse in Wisconsin.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

==Museum==
The childhood home of authors [[Sterling North]], and [[Jessica Nelson North|Jessica Nelson North MacDonald]] is open as a museum. Sterling North, whose most famous book, ''[[Rascal (book)|Rascal]],'' was set in Edgerton, used the town as the setting for several of his books, where he referred to it as &quot;Brailsford Junction.&quot;

==Events==
Because Edgerton was once the center of the tobacco growing region in Wisconsin, the community's annual celebration is called Tobacco Days. The community celebration includes live music, food, family entertainment, a craft fair, an open air market, living history events and demonstrations, tobacco demonstrations, citywide rummage sales, book sales, a parade, and a car show.

The Sterling North Book and Film Festival, which takes place annually the last weekend in September, brings together authors and filmmakers with the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Sterling North Book and Film Festival website | url = http://www.sterlingnorthbookfestival.com/ | accessdate = 29 Jul 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Muskego''' is a city in [[Waukesha County]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States]]. As of the 2010 census, the city had a population of 24,135.{{GR|2}}  Muskego is the fifth largest community in Waukesha County.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} The name Muskego is derived from the Potawatomi Indian name for the area, &quot;Mus-kee-Guaac&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greatlakesmaps.org/Default.aspx?tabid=83&amp;ctl=View&amp;mid=444&amp;MapID=10 Topographical map of Wisconsin Territory], 1837 (Morrison). Wisconsin's Water Library: Great Lake Maps. ''Accessed October 18, 2010.''&lt;/ref&gt; meaning [[Centrarchidae|sunfish]]. The Potawatomi were the original inhabitants of Muskego.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.Muskego.org Muskego, WI. Chamber of Commerce]&lt;/ref&gt; There are three lakes within the city's boundaries.

==History==
Once an agricultural area, Muskego was incorporated as a city in 1964. When it became a city it included the unincorporated communities of Tess Corners and Durham Hill. With an increase in housing developments in the city, it has become a [[bedroom community]] for [[Milwaukee]].

===Muskego Beach Amusement Park===
Muskego Beach Amusement Park (1861–1967),&lt;ref name=&quot;RCDB&quot;&gt;[http://www.rcdb.com/5472.htm RollerCoaster Database]&lt;/ref&gt; later known as DandeLion Park&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muskegohistory.org/DandeLionPark.aspx Muskego Historical Society]&lt;/ref&gt; (1968–1977),&lt;ref name=&quot;RCDB&quot;/&gt; was a popular amusement park located on the southern bank of Little Muskego Lake. It was at some point home of the world's fastest [[roller coaster]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

Charles Rose, operator of Wisconsin State Fair Park purchased Muskego Beach Amusement Park from Mrs. William Boszhardt in 1944. After World War II he reopened it. The park included rides, games of chance and was a venue for musical bands. Charles Rose died in 1963 and five years later, Willard Masterson purchased the park. He renamed it, &quot;DandiLion Park&quot; and added more amusement rides including the Tailspin roller coaster. In 1974 an eleven-year-old boy fell from the ferris wheel and died.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muskegohistory.org/DandeLionPark.aspx  Milwaukee Sentinel July 18, 1974]&lt;/ref&gt;

When Marriott's Great America (now [[Six Flags Great America]]) opened in 1976, it lured people away from Muskego, and into [[Gurnee, Illinois]]. The park was later closed and demolished, and the land developed into housing.

==Geography==
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|35.98|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which, {{convert|31.60|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|4.38|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.&lt;ref name =&quot;Gazetteer files&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muskego contains three lakes within its borders: Big Muskego Lake, Little Muskego Lake, and [[Lake Denoon]].

Big Muskego Lake is a shallow {{convert|2260|acre|km2|adj=on}} flow-through lake in south-central Muskego. Most of the lake is less than four feet deep with a generally organic or [[Muck (soil)|muck]] bottom.  Big Muskego Lake is fringed with [[cattail]]-dominated [[wetland]]s and encompasses numerous islands of cattail [[marsh]]. Bass Bay is a {{convert|110|acre|km2|adj=on}} connected [[embayment]] of Big Muskego Lake that has a deeper basin typical of other glacially formed [[kettle (landform)|kettle]] lakes in the region.  Bass Bay has a maximum depth of {{convert|23|ft|m}} and has a bottom [[Substrate (marine biology)|substrate]] of predominantly muck with some isolated sandy shoreline areas.

Little Muskego Lake is a {{convert|506|acre|km2|adj=on}} flow-through lake with extensive shallow margins and a single deep basin. Located in the northwestern quadrant of the city, the lake has a maximum depth of {{convert|65|ft|m}} and averages {{convert|14|ft|m}} deep. The bottom substrate predominantly consists of [[silt]] or muck. Residents and visitors to Little Muskego Lake enjoy a variety of lake-related recreational activities, including boating, skiing, sailing, and fishing. The Muskego Waterbugs perform a water ski show in front of Idle Isle Park each Wednesday evening throughout the summer. The lake contains many fish species including: [[largemouth bass]], [[northern pike]], [[walleye]], and several [[panfish]] species. Most of the shores of Little Muskego Lake are developed with residential housing.

Lake Denoon is a {{convert|162|acre|km2|adj=on}} lake in the southwestern portion of the city and is also partially located in the Town of [[Norway, Wisconsin]].  The lake has a glacially formed kettle basin that reaches a maximum depth of {{convert|55|ft|m}} with bottom substrates varying from sands and [[gravel]] to muck.  An outlet stream on the south end drains to Ke-Nong-Go-Mong (Long) Lake in [[Racine County]].  A cattail island and an extent of cattail shoreline are found on the lake's west end.  The remaining lakeshore is mostly developed with residential housing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ci.muskego.wi.us/planning/ConservationServices/LakeManagement/tabid/670/Default.aspx City of Muskego Planning Division]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Park Falls''' is a town in [[Price County, Wisconsin|Price County]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States]]. The population was 2,462 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].{{GR|2}} Located in the woods of north central Wisconsin, primarily the [[Chequamegon National Forest]], Park Falls is a small community divided by the North Fork of the Flambeau River, a popular destination for [[fishing]], [[canoeing]] and [[whitewater rafting]].

==History ==
The city began in the late 19th century as a small river village called Muskellunge Falls. It was later renamed Park Falls for the scenic beauty surrounding the former falls on the south side of town. With a pulp and [[paper mill]], the town grew rapidly and was incorporated as a city in 1912.

At the height of the city's industrial success the city's population swelled to more than 4,000 residents. At the same time, commercial development fueled a sizeable [[downtown]], which largely remains today.

Several residential [[Neighbourhood|neighborhood]]s, particularly along 1st Avenue North, were constructed of nearly identical homes and this affordable housing stock is one of the community's lasting assets.

Recent development, which mostly began in the early 1990s, has been primarily concentrated along Wis. Highway 13, a north-south highway that is the city's main thoroughfare.

Park Falls has been called the most geographically isolated community in all of Wisconsin.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Several governmental offices are located there, including a [[school district]], a [[National Forest Service]] office, an outpost of the Wisconsin Department of National Resources, and the northern office of the state [[governor]].

Park Falls has two [[stoplight]]-controlled [[intersection (road)|intersections]], the only stoplights in Price County. The nearest neighboring community with a stoplight is at least 45 minutes away in any direction.

==Geography==
Park Falls is located at {{Coord|45|56|5|N|90|26|55|W|type:city}} (45.934590, -90.448538).{{GR|1}}

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|3.83|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which, {{convert|3.60|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.23|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.&lt;ref name =&quot;Gazetteer files&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Industry==
[[File:Park Falls 6.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Flambeau Paper Company Office Building|offices of Flambeau River Papers]]]]
The Flambeau River Papers Corporation (formerly Flambeau Paper Company), a namesake of the Flambeau River, was once the largest [[employer]] in the area. The mill, which closed in early 2006, underwent many name changes throughout its more than 100-year history. Its closure was a significant economic shock for the community. Local and state officials offered relocation, and educational and mental health services for displaced workers. A buyer was found for the mill and it was reopened in August 2006 as Flambeau River Papers.

Park Falls is also home to St. Croix Rod, a world-renowned [[fishing rod]] company and a factory for [[Medford, Wisconsin]]-based Weather Shield, a [[window]] manufacturer.

The town's slowly declining population, eroding [[tax base]] and shrinking class sizes have created financial challenges for the Park Falls School District, geographically the largest school district in Wisconsin.

==Sports and recreation==
The Chequamegon Screaming Eagles (formerly known as the Park Falls Cardinals), have had a long-standing [[sports rivalry|rivalry]] with the [[Phillips, WI]] school sports teams, the Loggers.The school district combined with the Glidden school district creating the Chequamegon School District. The school district's athletics programs have a history of state championships and record-setting athletes.

The abundance of public [[forests]] and several [[lakes]], including the [[Turtle-Flambeau Flowage]] to the east of the city, has made Park Falls a destination for outdoor enthusiasts. [[Hunting]], fishing, [[snowmobiling]] and ATV riding are popular attractions for residents and tourists alike and the town is connected to an extensive system of off highway vehicle (OHV) trails.

==Events==
Park Falls celebrates its community [[festival]], Flambeau Rama, every year during the first weekend in August. The fair is a popular event and many [[high school]] [[class reunion]]s are held during the four-day event. In its early years, the Flambeau Rama was focused on the downtown business area, as an enticement to bring the community together, however, in recent years, the event has been moved to a field on the far north end of town, where there are no businesses to reap the benefits of the added foot traffic.  As a result, the attendance has dropped dramatically.

'''Antigo''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|n|t|ɪ|ˌ|g|oʊ}} {{respell|AN|ti-goh}})&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's New Geographical Dictionary'' (G. &amp; C. Merriam Co., 1972), p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; is a city in and the [[county seat]] of [[Langlade County, Wisconsin|Langlade County]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States]].{{GR|6}} The population was 8,234 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. Antigo is the center of a farming and lumbering district, and its manufactures consist principally of lumber, chairs, furniture, sashes, doors and blinds, hubs and spokes, and other wood products.

== History ==
The name &quot;Antigo&quot; comes from the Chippewa Indian name for the river that flows through the area, &quot;''Nequi-Antigo-sebi''&quot; meaning &quot;spring river&quot; or &quot;evergreen&quot;.

The city was founded in 1878 by Francis A. Deleglise and George Eckart. The log cabin in which Deleglise lived is preserved and on display at the [[Langlade County Museum]]. A street in Antigo also bears his name. The city gained its charter in 1883.

In the early part of the 1900s, Antigo was best known for its sawmills. At the turn of the millennium, the city's economy had a balance of industry and agriculture. High on the list are potatoes, dairy products, fur, shoes, fertilizer, steel and aluminum products, along with the lumber and wood product industries established in the earlier years.

== Geography ==
Antigo is located at {{coord|45|8|28|N|89|9|12|W|type:city}} (45.141218, -89.153385),{{GR|1}} about {{convert|160|mi|km}} northwest of Milwaukee.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|6.60|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which, {{convert|6.54|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.06|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.&lt;ref name =&quot;Gazetteer files&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antigo sits on a plateau about {{convert|1500|ft|m}} above sea level. The wide expanse of level land, the fine stand of timber and the fertility of the &quot;Antigo Flats&quot; soil soon attracted many settlers. Today the [[Antigo (soil)|Antigo Silt Loam soil]] is the state soil of [[Wisconsin]].

==Climate==
Antigo has a cool [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Dfb''), with long, cold winters and short, mild summers. Annually the temperature drops below 32 °F (0 °C) on 187 days, and below 0 °F (-17.8 °C) on 43 days.

'''Black River Falls''' is a city in [[Jackson County, Wisconsin|Jackson County]], [[Wisconsin]], USA. The population was 3,622 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. It is [[Jackson County, Wisconsin|Jackson County's]] [[county seat]].{{GR|6}} The [[Ho-Chunk]] Nation has its administrative center in Black River Falls.

==History==
[[Image:Falls of the Black River (WI).jpg|thumb|250px|right|Falls of the [[Black River (Wisconsin)|Black River]]]]
Black River Falls was founded to utilize the [[waterpower]] of the [[Black River (Wisconsin)|Black River]]. As the area was predominantly forest at the time, its primary use was in operating [[sawmill]]s. Some of the lumber produced was used in the construction of the [[Mormon]] temple at [[Nauvoo, Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackriverfalls.com/area_history.html blackriverfalls.com - Home&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

A large monument to Black River Falls' veterans of [[World War I]], [[World War II]], the [[Korean War]], and the [[Vietnam War]], as well as to local [[Medal of Honor]] recipient [[Mitchell Red Cloud, Jr.]], was erected near the Chamber of Commerce Building at 101 S. 2nd Street. Named the &quot;Field of Honor&quot;, the attached plaques provide accounts of the veterans' services. This site is also the start of the four-mile (6.5&amp;nbsp;km) Foundation Trail, a signed hiking and bike path that circles the eastern part of the community.
Black River Falls is the focus of Michael Lesy's book Wisconsin Death Trip (1973), which used photographs and newspaper cuttings to highlight the harshness of life in the community during the late nineteenth century and the effects it had on the psychology of the inhabitants. To this day the city has a higher murder and suicide rate than the rest of Wisconsin.

==Geography==
Black River Falls is located at {{Coord|44|17|50|N|90|50|57|W|type:city}} (44.297166, -90.849263).{{GR|1}} According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|4.20|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which, {{convert|4.10|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.10|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.&lt;ref name =&quot;Gazetteer files&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the surrounding land is part of the [http://dnr.wi.gov/forestry/stateforests/SF-BlackRiver/ Black River State Forest]

==Government==
[[File:Jackson County Wisconsin Courthouse March 2012.jpg|thumb|right|Courthouse]]
City Hall, located at 101 S. 2nd St, houses the mayor, Ron Danielson; the city administrator, Bill Arndt; deputy city clerks and treasurers; the Parks and Recreation Department and the Police Department. Offices for Jackson County are located on Main Street.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.co.jackson.wi.us/html/county%20clerk/county_clerk.html] Jackson County Offices&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
[[File:Wisconsin, Black River Falls, Old High School.jpg|thumb|right|Old High School]]
[[Black River Falls High School]], the city's public high school located on the southwestern edge of town, is administered by the Black River Falls School District. The former high school, in the center of the city, has been converted to apartments. [[Western Technical College]] offers classes in the city.

==Media==
Despite its size, Black River Falls has two newspapers, both published weekly: the ''Banner-Journal'' and the ''Jackson County Chronicle''.

WWIS Radio operates the only radio stations in Black River Falls: WWIS 1260AM and WWIS 99.7FM. The AM station operates only during daytime hours.

==Culture==
Black River Falls is the focus of [[Michael Lesy]]'s book ''[[Wisconsin Death Trip]]'' (1973), which used photographs and newspaper cuttings to highlight the harshness of life in the community during the late nineteenth century and the effects it had on the psychology of the inhabitants. The book was made into a film in 2000, which included images from the community as it appears today. However, the claim that all the stories took place in and around Black River Falls is false.

Lesy drew on the work of Charles Van Schaick, the main photographer in Black River Falls between the 1870s and 1930s.  Van Schaick made remarkable portraits of the [[Ho-Chunk]] (Winnebago) peoples who remained in or returned to the area after the forced Indian removals of the mid-19th century.  The pictures were made primarily in Van Schaick's commercial studio in downtown Black River Falls, and he was one of the few photographers of his time to make sensitive studio portraits of Native Americans.  Van Schaick's numerous photographs are now housed at the Wisconsin Historical Society in Madison and were the subject of a book, ''People of the Big Voice,'' published in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://stephenjessetaylor.wordpress.com/2013/07/25/charles-van-schaick-a-voice-from-the-passion-of-nature/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Black River Falls area is home to a large population of the [[endangered]] [[Karner Blue]] [[butterfly]]. The city celebrates with the Karner Blue Butterfly Festival held annually on the third Saturday of July.

==Transportation==
The primary artery of transportation for Black River Falls is [[Interstate 94]], which passes through the eastern edge of the city. [[US Highway 12]], [[Wisconsin Highway 27]], and [[Wisconsin Highway 54]] also pass through the city.

The [[Union Pacific Railroad]] is adjacent to the city, but does not pass through the center.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dot.wisconsin.gov/localgov/docs/railmap.pdf] Wisconsin DOT Railway Map&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Superior''' is a city in, and the [[county seat]] of, [[Douglas County, Wisconsin|Douglas County]] in the US state of Wisconsin.{{GR|6}} The population was 27,244 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].  Located at the junction of [[U.S. Highway 2]] and [[U.S. Highway 53]], it is immediately north of and adjacent to both the [[Superior (village), Wisconsin|Village of Superior]] and the [[Superior (town), Wisconsin|Town of Superior]]. It houses many neighborhoods including Billings Park, North End, South Superior, Central
Park, East End, Allouez, and Itasca. Billings Park, South Superior, East End, and North End have small business districts.  

Superior is at the western end of [[Lake Superior]] in northwestern Wisconsin. Bordered by Saint Louis Bay, Superior Bay, and Allouez Bay, it is also framed by two rivers: the Nemadji and the Saint Louis. Superior, and the neighboring city across the bay, [[Duluth, Minnesota]], form a single metropolitan area called the [[Twin Ports]] and share a harbor that is one of the most important ports on the [[Great Lakes]]. Both cities have [[museum ship]]s ([[William A Irvin|SS ''William A Irvin'']] in Duluth and {{SS|Meteor|1896|6}} in Superior) devoted to the local nautical heritage. Superior was the last port of call for the ''[[SS Edmund Fitzgerald|Edmund Fitzgerald]]'' before its famous 1975 sinking.

==History==
The first-known inhabitants of what is now Douglas County were [[Mound builder (people)|Mound Builders]]. These people appeared on the shores of [[Lake Superior]] sometime after the latest glacier receded. They mined copper in the [[Glacial Lake Minong|Minong Range]] and at Manitou Falls on the Black River. They pounded this metal into weapons, implements, and ornaments, which were later found buried in mounds with their dead. Their civilization was eventually overrun by other tribes, mainly of [[Muskhogean]] and [[Iroquois]] stock, and disappeared as a distinct culture in late prehistoric American times.

About the time of the European arrival, the Duluth–Superior region transitioned from being predominately [[Sioux|Dakota]] to being predominately [[Ojibwa|Ojibwa/Chippewa]]. In the Ojibwa oral history, Spirit Island in the [[Saint Louis River]] was their &quot;Sixth Stopping Place&quot; where the northern and southern divisions of Ojibwa nation came together in their westward migration. The City of Superior in the [[Ojibwe language]] is called ''Gete-oodena'', meaning &quot;Old Town&quot; as the [[Lake Superior Chippewa]] population center of the Ojibwa later moved east toward [[Madeline Island]], the &quot;Seventh Stopping Place&quot;, and the [[Mississippi Chippewa]] towards [[Brainerd, Minnesota]] (thus calling both Brainerd and [[Bayfield, Wisconsin]] as ''Oshki-oodena'' (&quot;New Town&quot;) in the Ojibwe language).

The first-known Europeans to visit the area were French. In 1618, [[Étienne Brûlé]], a voyager for [[Samuel de Champlain]], coasted along the south shore of [[Lake Superior]] where he met the Ojibwa.  Upon returning to [[Quebec]], he carried back some copper specimens and a glowing account of the region.  In 1632, [[Samuel de Champlain|Champlain]]’s map appeared showing “Lac Superior de Tracy” as [[Lake Superior]] and the lower end shore as “[[Fond du Lac (Duluth)|Fond du Lac]].” Soon after, fur trading companies established settlements, while missionaries came bringing with them the first touches of European civilization.

For more than a century, the [[Hudson's Bay Company]], followed by the Northwestern Fur Company in 1787 and later, the [[John Jacob Astor]] Fur Company, maintained trading posts with the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. With the coming of settlement, however, the voyager and fur trader faded into the misty twilight of a romantic and historic past. 

Douglas County lies on one of the major water highways used by early travelers and voyagers of inland America. This water trail, the Bois Brule–St. Croix River Portage Trail, was the most convenient connecting link between [[Lake Superior]] and the [[Mississippi River]]. The Bois Brule and St. Croix River systems were only separated by a short portage over the [[Eastern Continental Divide]] near Solon Springs, [[Wisconsin]]. The northward traveler used this water trail to take him to Lake Superior, while the downstream traveler could use it to go southwest to the [[Gulf of Mexico]], unhindered by portages, by using the St. Croix and [[Mississippi]] Rivers. This waterway was also an important route in the Wisconsin fur trade, particularly when the French War with the Fox Indians closed the more southern routes. Spurred by the prospect of lucrative shipping and iron ore industry, businessmen from Chicago and St. Paul laid claim to the site which became the city of Superior, and plans began for the plotting of a great city 

The first log cabin in Superior was erected in September 1853 on the banks of the [[Nemadji River]], paralleling the breaking of ground for the locks and ship canal at [[Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan|Sault Ste. Marie]], [[Michigan]]. This brought the dawning of a new age for the infant community, which was incorporated as a city on September 6, 1854.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ci.superior.wi.us/index.asp?NID=57 Superior, WI – Official Website – History of Superior&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time Superior became the seat of newly formed Douglas County. Immediately there was eagerness for a railroad from [[Lake Superior]] to the Pacific Coast, and investment flowed in, but then the [[Panic of 1857]] hit, investment slowed, and the population of the new city collapsed from 2500 to 500.&lt;ref name=HABS&gt;{{cite book|last=Lusignan|first=Paul R.|title=Massachusetts Block|publisher=National Park Service - Historical American Buildings Survey|pages=4|url=http://memory.loc.gov/pnp/habshaer/wi/wi0200/wi0240/data/wi0240data.pdf|coauthors=Thomas Hendrickson}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Twenty-five years later the [[Northern Pacific Railway]] and other rail lines finally arrived, fulfilling the dream of a rail and water highway from coast to coast. In 1883 General John H. Hammond formed the Land and River Improvement Company, which developed much of West Superior, including the West Superior Iron and Steel plant. Numerous grain, coal and lumber businesses formed in the same period.&lt;ref name=HABS /&gt;

[[Image:MinnesotaBlockSuperiorWI.JPG|thumb|160px|right|Minnesota Block, a.k.a. Board of Trade Building, built 1892]]In the Boom Period from 1888 to 1892, Land and River Improvement and others built impressive architect-designed business blocks on Tower Avenue, seeing Superior as the &quot;new Chicago.&quot;  Many of the investors were from out East, so the buildings received names like the New Jersey Block and the Maryland Block.&lt;ref name=HABS /&gt; By 1892, population was 34,000. Then the [[Panic of 1893]] hit, and development slowed again.&lt;ref name=HABS /&gt;

Between 1890 and 1920, the city was heavily settled by migrants from the eastern United States as well as immigrants from over 15 countries, including England, Scotland, Ireland, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Belgium, Germany, Austria, Hungary, and Croatia.

==Geography==
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|55.65|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which, {{convert|36.96|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|18.69|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.&lt;ref name =&quot;Gazetteer files&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{coord|46.713385|-92.087746|display=inline}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://wikimapia.org/#y=46713385&amp;x=-92087746&amp;z=13&amp;l=0&amp;m=a&amp;v=2link wikimapia link]&lt;/ref&gt;)  Most of Superior is level with a gradual slope toward Lake Superior.

There are several parks in the city, including the second largest municipal forest in the United States, located in the city's Billings Park neighborhood.  [[Pattison State Park]] is a short distance south of the city, and contains [[Big Manitou Falls]], the highest [[waterfall]] in the state at {{convert|165|ft|m}}.

It was used to move large quantities of pulpwood logs, making the process of stacking wood faster, safer, and easier. The stacker has been unused since 1972, but is considered a historical treasure. An annual town fair, known as the Stacker Festival, continues today.

'''Waupaca''' is a city in [[Waupaca County, Wisconsin|Waupaca County]] in the [[U.S. state|state]] of [[Wisconsin]].  The population was 6,069 at the 2010 census.  The city is believed to be named after Sam Waupaca (or Chief Wapuka) of the [[Potowatomi]] tribe.

The city is located mostly within the [[Waupaca (town), Wisconsin|Town of Waupaca]], though it is politically independent. A portion extends west into the adjacent [[Farmington, Waupaca County, Wisconsin|Town of Farmington]] and there is also a noncontiguous area of the city in the [[Lind, Wisconsin|Town of Lind]] to the south. The city is divided into natural areas, city areas, and industrial areas.

== History ==
The area was settled by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] [[mound builder (people)|mound builders]] prior to European settlement.  The area was at one time home to over 72 mounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;waupacachamberhistory&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waupacaareachamber.com/history.html |title=History of Waupaca   |publisher=Waupaca Area Chamber of Commerce |date= |accessdate=2010-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was first settled by famous explorer &quot;Joseph Michael Scherr&quot; with his American settlers in June 1849, on a small waterfall along the [[Waupaca River]]. At the time, the area was home to the [[Menominee]] and [[Potowatomi]] tribes.  The name for the settlement came either from the Indian term &quot;waubuck seba,&quot; meaning pale water, or from a Potowatomi man named [[Sam Wapuka]], or Chief Waupaca.&lt;ref name=&quot;waupacachamberhistory&quot; /&gt;

Waupaca was incorporated as a village on March 5, 1857 by act of the [[Wisconsin State Legislature]] under mayor Joseph Scherr III.&lt;ref&gt;Private and Local Laws of the State of Wisconsin, 1857, chapter 264 http://sos.nmtvault.com/pdf/THEOSOS_025/images/00013923.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This act was repealed on April 7, 1862,&lt;ref&gt;Private and Local Laws of the State of Wisconsin, 1862, chapter 321 http://sos.nmtvault.com/pdf/THEOSOS_025/images/00013924.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; but promptly revived on June 17 of the same year.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'', chapter 365 http://sos.nmtvault.com/pdf/THEOSOS_025/images/00013924.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Waupaca was incorporated as a city by the legislature on March 5, 1875.&lt;ref&gt;http://sos.nmtvault.com/pdf/THEOSOS_025/images/00013927.pdf An Act to incorporate the city of Waupaca&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 1960s and continuing to the present, it has expanded through annexation.

'''New Berlin''' is a city in [[Waukesha County, Wisconsin|Waukesha County]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States]]. The population was 39,584 at the 2010 census, making it the second largest community in Waukesha County after the city of [[Waukesha, Wisconsin|Waukesha]].

New Berlin is situated on the eastern border of Waukesha County. [[Interstate 94]] is located immediately north of the city, and [[Interstate 43]] passes through it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newberlin.org/media/1602176/nb%20brochure.pdf City of New Berlin, &quot;Let Us Introduce Ourselves&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pronunciation==
Area residents put the accent on the first syllable of Berlin {{IPAc-en|n|uː|ˈ|b|ɜr|l|ɨ|n}}, rather than the second.

==History==
The first settlers, Sidney Evans and P.G. Harrington, arrived in the northeastern part of what is now the New Berlin in 1836. The area first came under local government in 1838 as part of the Town of [[Muskego, Wisconsin|Muskego]], which at the time was composed of New Berlin and Muskego. The area that is now the city of New Berlin was separated from the Town of Muskego in 1839 and named the Town of Mentor.&lt;ref name=&quot;newberlin.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.newberlin.org/residents/community/history--landmarks.aspx City of New Berlin-History&amp;Landmarks]&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 13, 1840, the Town of Mentor became the Town of New Berlin. It was named by Sidney Evans for his hometown, [[New Berlin (town), New York|New Berlin, New York]]. The town remained a rural and agricultural area until the 1940s, when the westward migration to the suburbs from Milwaukee began. Between 1850 and 1950, New Berlin's population went from 1,293 to 5,334. Ten years later, in 1960, the population had nearly tripled to 15,788. The Town of New Berlin became the City of New Berlin with its incorporation in 1959.&lt;ref name=&quot;newberlin.org&quot;/&gt;

Large-scale growth to New Berlin occurred in the 1960s and 1970s, mainly as a result of the construction of the New Berlin Industrial Park, which began in 1964. The park is composed of three separate business parks encompassing {{convert|1126|acre|km2|sigfig=2}}. The business parks include the Moorland Road Industrial Park, the New Berlin Industrial Park and the MSI/Lincoln Avenue Industrial Park.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newberlin.org/media/documents/Public/Planning/EconDev/A_Vision_for_the_Future_of_the_New_Berlin_Article.pdf  City of New Berlin, &quot;A Vision for the Future of the New Berlin Industrial Park&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Interstate 43]] has been expanded at the Moorland Road exit in order to accommodate a growing number of commuters from the suburb. The new interchange has a two-lane [[roundabout]] that has been the center of a great deal of controversy because of the high number of accidents and traffic back-ups on [[Interstate 43]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Are roundabouts dangerous? So far, yes|url=http://www.newberlinnow.com/news/56607067.html|date=2009-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==

'''Cedarburg''' is a city in [[Ozaukee County, Wisconsin|Ozaukee County]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States]] with [[Cedar Creek, Wisconsin|Cedar Creek]] running through it. The city is bordered by the [[Grafton, Wisconsin|Village of Grafton]] to the east and the [[Cedarburg (town), Wisconsin|Town of Cedarburg]] elsewhere. Cedarburg is a suburban community, about {{convert|20|mi|km}} north of [[Milwaukee]] and near the shores of Lake Michigan. The population was 11,412 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].

== History ==
The first person to settle in the area was Joseph Gardenier, who built a log shanty on Cedar Creek, in what is now Hamilton. The shanty was his headquarters for surveying for the construction of the Green Bay Road.&lt;ref name=Roots&gt;{{cite book|title=Histories of Washington and Ozaukee Counties|publisher=Western Publishing|date=1881|chapter=Cedarburg History|url=http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~wiozauke/histories/Cedarburg.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frederick August Leuning, who immigrated to the area in 1843, built a cabin near Cedar Creek on what was later the east end of the city. He called the cabin &quot;Cedarburg&quot;, which meant &quot;the castle of the [[Thuja occidentalis|Cedar]]s&quot;. Soon afterwards, he built the Columbia Mill on that site.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, H. ''Sketches of Cedarburg,'' Cedarburg Commemorative Corp., 1985, p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Cedbg-center.jpg|thumb|200px|left|A characteristic street scene, with buildings dating to the late 1800s.]]

In 1845, Frederick Hilgen and William Schroeder founded the village of Cedarburg. A year earlier, they had built a [[gristmill]] on Cedar Creek. After eleven years of operation, they replaced the original structure with the five-story, stone [[Cedarburg Mill]]. This became the focal point of the new community. Five [[dam]]s and mills were eventually built along the creek in what are now the city and town of Cedarburg. The Hilgen Spring Park, begun in 1854, was a {{convert|74|acre|m2|adj=on}} resort, that attracted visitors from all over the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]].&lt;ref name=Roots /&gt;

The Cedarburg Woolen Mill was founded in 1864. By 1893, it was the largest woolen mill west of [[Philadelphia]]. In 1897, a generator was installed, producing the first electricity in the town. In 1901, the city contracted an electric plant with [[steam engine]]s running two 75&amp;nbsp;kW [[Electrical generator|generators]], and in 1909 the Cedarburg Electric Light Commission was formed to run the [[Public utility|utility]]. In 1923, responsibility for water and [[sanitary sewer|sewer]]age was given to the utility, and it was renamed the Light &amp; Water Commission. The utility is still in business today, and is one of 82 [[Municipality|municipally]] owned electric utilities in Wisconsin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cedarburglightandwater.com/about_us/default.asp?CategoryNumber=2 Cedarburg Light &amp; Water]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tourism ===
The woolen mill closed in 1968 sitting vacant for several years, until an offer was made to buy the buildings. The prospective owner intended to tear them down and build a gas station and a mini-mart. Then mayor, Stephan Fischer, told him he would need a demolition permit. There was no such thing, but it bought enough time that the buildings could be saved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.biztimes.com/news/2007/11/9/cedarburg-has-formula-for-model-downtown|title=Cedarburg has formula for model downtown|last=Steffes|first=Judy|date=November 9, 2007|publisher=BizTiimes.com|accessdate=2009-05-19}}{{dead link|date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; William Welty bought the buildings on the corner and street, opening a restaurant. Jim Pape then bought the mill buildings on the creekside, opening a [[winery]]. Known as the Cedar Creek Settlement, the rest of the space was rented out to shops, studios and restaurants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.co.ozaukee.wi.us/history/CedarCreekSettlement.htm|title= History  Cedarburg Woolen Mill Cedar Creek Settlement |publisher=Ozaukee County|accessdate=2009-05-19}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This began a tourism boom in Cedarburg. As the city became a quaint and pleasant place to visit, more galleries and studios opened, as well as souvenir shops and other attractions. Business associations started weekend festivals, which attracted even more people to the city. In the summer months, local companies sponsor a concert series called Summer Sounds which takes place at Cedar Creek Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Summer Sounds|url=http://summersounds.net/index.php/home|publisher=Cedarburg Music Festivals|accessdate=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Beginning in 1974, many buildings in the city of Cedarburg have been added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] (NRHP). The individual sites, combined with the Historic Districts, include 216 buildings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wistravel.com/cities_in_wisconsin/cedarburg_wisconsin/ Cedarburg Wisconsin&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The area that Waukesha now encompasses was first inhabited in 1834. Its first non-American-Indian settler was Morris D. Cutler.

By 1846, the area was [[Municipal corporation|incorporated]] as the village of Prairieville.&lt;ref name=&quot;slahs-land&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Land Divisions Within Waukesha County | publisher = Sussex-Lisbon Area Historical Society, Inc. | url = http://www.slahs.org/history/local/historic_places/land_divisions.htm | accessdate = 2007-04-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 8, 1847, the village changed its name to, &quot;Waukesha,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://192.159.83.40/SOS/pdf/THEOSOS_012/images/00007668.pdf |title=NAME CHANGED FROM PRAIRIEVILLE TO WAUKESHA, P. 100, 1847, FEBRUARY 8, 1847 |accessdate=2007-04-08 |author=Town of Prairieville |publisher=Office of the Secretary of State of Wisconsin|format=PDF |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070704221209/http://192.159.83.40/SOS/pdf/THEOSOS_012/images/00007668.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1896, incorporated as a city.&lt;ref&gt;name=&quot;slahs-land&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Waukesha's name===
Over the years, many believed, incorrectly, that the origin of the name of the city was an [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] word meaning &quot;fox&quot; or &quot;little foxes,&quot; though it is actually an Anglicization of the [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]] proper name ''Waagoshag'' or the [[Potawatomi language|Potawatomi]] name ''Wau-tsha''. Wau-tsha (sometimes written as Wauk-tsha&lt;ref name=&quot;WisArch&quot;&gt;Wisconsin Archeological Society, ''The Wisconsin Archeologist'', 1922, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; or Wauke-tsha) was the leader of the local tribe at the time of the first European settlement of the area. This is confirmed by accounts of [[Increase A. Lapham]], an early settler and historian of the region.&lt;ref&gt;Langill, Ellen D. &amp; Jean Penn Loerke, ''From Farmlands to Freeways: A History of Waukesha County Wisconsin'', Waukesha County Historical Society, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lapham, the word for &quot;fox&quot; was ''pishtaka.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=%2Ftp&amp;CISOPTR=1265&amp;REC=0&amp;CISOBOX=Prairieville ''A geographical and topographical description of Wisconsin...''], p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; Cutler also told visitors about Wau-tsha, who was described as &quot;tall and athletic, proud in his bearing, dignified and friendly.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;WisArch&quot;/&gt;

===&quot;Spring City&quot;===
[[Image:Richard Sears.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Sears &amp; Roebuck]] founder [[Richard Warren Sears|Richard W. Sears]] spent his last years on his farm near Waukesha.]]

[[Matthew Laflin]], an early pioneer of [[Chicago, Illinois]], provided the capital and enterprise that laid the foundation for Waukesha as a famous Wisconsin watering resort and was the proprietor of the grand resort, the Fountain Spring House. Waukesha was once known for its extremely clean and good-tasting [[mineral water|spring water]] and was called a, &quot;[[spa town]].&quot; This earned the city the nicknames, &quot;Spring City,&quot; and, &quot;[[Saratoga Springs, NY|Saratoga]] of the West.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&amp;dat=19690808&amp;id=9twjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=YSgEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7278,3931676: &quot;Waukesha Spa&quot;] ''Milwaukee Journal.''

According to author Kristine Adams Wendt, in 1868, Colonel Richard Dunbar, a sufferer of diabetes, chanced upon the medicinal properties of what he later named the Bethesda Spring while viewing a parcel of land recently purchased by his sister. Testimonials found in a Dunbar brochure of 1873 proclaimed the miraculous benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Mary Todd Lincoln: &quot;Great Sorrows&quot; and the Healing Waters of Waukesha| author = Wendt, Kristine Adams | publisher = Wisconsin Academy Review | date = Spring 1992 | url = http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/WI/WI-idx?type=HTML&amp;rgn=DIV1&amp;byte=465129 | accessdate = 2008-10-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wendt reports that by 1872, &quot;area newspapers carried accounts of a community ill equipped to handle its new popularity among the suffering multitudes. The semi-weekly ''Wisconsin (Milwaukee)'' of July 31, 1872, reported 'that fully 500 visitors are quartered in hotels and scattered in private families here, seeking benefit from the marvelous waters...'&quot;

The &quot;healing waters&quot; were so valued that a controversial attempt was made to build a pipeline between the city and [[Chicago]] so that they could be enjoyed by visitors to the 1893 [[Columbian Exposition]].&lt;ref&gt;Larson, Eric, ''The Devil in the White City'', p.139,175-76&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, &quot;[t]he scheme had been conceived by one Charles Welsh who had been given the springs by his uncle, but after several miles of pipe were laid, it was discovered that the cost was too great.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=iPad iPhone Android TIME TV Populist The Page |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,738469,00.html |title=&quot;Business: Mixings Mixture?&quot;, Time, January 20, 1930 |publisher=Time.com |date=1930-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Warren Sears|Richard W. Sears]], founder of [[Sears and Roebuck]], may have been attracted to Waukesha by the waters. In failing health, Sears retired from business in 1908 and, according to ''[[The New York Times]]'', &quot;spent his time on his great farm near Waukesha.&quot; In 1914, Sears died in Waukesha of [[Bright's disease]], leaving an estate estimated at $20 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Richard W.

In 1956, Helen Moore, who ran a mud bath spa in Waukesha, appeared as a guest on ''[[What's My Line]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb4fdnyt-0s |title=Last Fred Allen Episode-What's My Line (2/3) |publisher=YouTube |date=2008-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, the natural springs have been spoiled by pollution and a number have gone dry.

===Football history===
[[Image:RobinsonThrowing.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Bradbury Robinson|Brad Robinson]] threw the first legal forward pass in Waukesha in 1906.]]
One of the most important &quot;firsts&quot; in American sports history occurred in Waukesha on September 5, 1906, when [[Carroll University|Carroll College]] (now Carroll University) hosted the football team from [[St. Louis University]]. SLU halfback [[Bradbury Robinson]] threw the first legal [[forward pass]] in football history in that game. The Carroll players and local fans were stunned. The visitors went on to win 22–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Football’s Forward Pass Turns 100 Years Old | publisher = [[St. Louis University]] | url = http://www.slu.edu/readstory/more/7166 | accessdate = 2008-10-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Project Nike===
During the [[Cold War]], Waukesha County was the site of three [[Project Nike|Nike Missile batteries]], located in the city of Waukesha and nearby [[Muskego]] and [[Lannon]]. In the city of Waukesha, the [[U.S. Army]] and later the [[Wisconsin National Guard]] operated the command and control center from 1956 to 1970 at what is now [[Hillcrest Park (Waukesha, Wisconsin)|Hillcrest Park]] on Davidson Road. The missile pits existed near the corner of Cleveland Avenue and Hwy 164 – first holding [[Nike Ajax|Ajax missiles]] with [[conventional]] [[warheads]] and later the [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear]] equipped [[Project Nike#Nike Hercules|Hercules warhead]]. The Hercules provided a similar nuclear capability as that of the [[atomic bomb]] dropped on [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]] in [[World War II]]. The Midwest Chapter of the [[Cold War Museum]] has promoted the preservation of the Hillcrest Park site as a local Cold War museum, honoring Cold War veterans and commemorating America's longest and costliest conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coldwar.org |title=Coldwar.org |publisher=Coldwar.org |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography and climate==
Waukesha is located near the center of Waukesha County in southeastern Wisconsin, {{convert|18|mi}} west of [[Milwaukee]]. Waukesha is also located {{convert|59|mi}} east of [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]].

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|25.07|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which, {{convert|24.81|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.26|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.&lt;ref name =&quot;Gazetteer files&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city is located on both sides of the [[Fox River (Illinois River tributary)|Fox River]], which starts near [[Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin|Menomonee Falls]] and flows into the [[Illinois River]].

[[Köppen-Geiger climate classification system]] classifies its climate as [[humid continental]] (Dfb).

==Infrastructure==

===WiFi===
Cellnet Technology Inc (based in [[Alpharetta, Georgia]]) plans to make Waukesha the second community in Wisconsin outfitted with a city-wide [[Wi-Fi]] network blanket. (Midwest Fiber Networks is scheduled to make Milwaukee the state's first wi-fi municipality by summer 2006.)&lt;ref&gt;Esptein, Reid J. [http://www.jsonline.com/news/wauk/feb06/389874.asp &quot;Waukesha could be next city to go Wi-Fi&quot;] ''[[Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel]]'', February 3, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cellnet, which began working on a similar &quot;blanket&quot; for [[Madison, Wisconsin]] in early 2006, had planned to present their idea to Waukesha's Information Technology Advisory Committee in February 2006. If the proposed installation of the network goes through, city residents would only have to buy a [[wireless card]] (typically $50 USD) to gain access to the internet from any area in Waukesha.

As of September 2007, the project was mired in logistical difficulties,&lt;ref&gt;Darrel Enriquez and Larry Sandler [http://www.jsonline.com/news/wisconsin/29256499.html &quot;Is Wi-Fi a losing strategy?&quot;] ''[[Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel]]'', September 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Conning Chu [http://www.jsonline.com/news/waukesha/29432149.html &quot;Wi-Fi plans falling short, official says&quot;] ''[[Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel]]'', June 22, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and appears dropped shortly thereafter.

==History==
[[File:MiltonHouse2010WIS26.jpg|thumb|left|[[Milton House]].]]
The city was formed as a result of the 1967 merger of the villages of Milton and Milton Junction. In November of that year, ballots were cast by 1,093 voters from both villages (Milton: 515 to 47 in favor of the merge; Milton Junction: 322 to 201 in favor of the merge), and the referendum to merge the two was approved by 77%.&lt;ref&gt;''Historic Headlines: From the Files of Milton Newspapers Since 1878.''

'''Stoughton''' is a city in [[Dane County, Wisconsin|Dane County]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States]]. It straddles the [[Yahara River]] about 20 miles southeast of the state capital, [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]]. Stoughton is part of the Madison [[Madison, Wisconsin metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]]. As of the 2010 census, the population was 12,611.

Known for its Norwegian heritage, Stoughton hosts a citywide celebration of [[Syttende Mai]], the Norwegian constitution day. Part of the city's celebration of its Norwegian heritage is the Stoughton Norwegian Dancers dance group, sponsored by Stoughton High School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stoughtonnorwegiandancers.net/|title=Stoughton Norwegian Dancers|accessdate=2009-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stoughton's sister city is [[Gjøvik]], [[Norway]].

==History==
Stoughton was founded in 1847 by Luke Stoughton, an Englishman from Vermont. Many [[Norwegian American|Norwegian immigrants]] settled in the town from 1865 through the early 1900s.&lt;ref name=&quot;historical&quot;&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.stoughtonhistoricalsociety.org |title=Stoughton Historical Society }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stoughton also claims to be the birthplace of the &quot;Coffee Break&quot;, and hosts a small yearly parade to celebrate the distinction.

For much of the history of the area, Stoughton has been the second-largest and economically important city in Dane County after Madison.&lt;ref&gt;Ruff, pp. 157&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919, Stoughton Wagon Company began putting custom wagon bodies on Model T chassis;&lt;ref&gt;[[Georgano, G. N.]] ''Cars: Early and Vintage, 1886–1930''. (London: Grange-Universal, 1985)&lt;/ref&gt; by 1929 [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] was by far the biggest seller of station wagons.

On August 18, 2005, an [[Wisconsin Tornado Outbreak of August 2005#Stoughton area tornado|F3 tornado]] cut a 10-mile path across rural subdivisions and farms north of Stoughton, killing one person and damaging hundreds of homes.

In June 2010 a third water tower was built. After it was finished, the town's name was painted on either side; on one side the painters mistakenly left out the second T, spelling it 'STOUGHON'. The mistake was corrected soon after at no cost to the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel3000.com/news/23937092/detail.html |title=Doh! Stoughton Water Tower Displays Wrong Name |publisher=channel3000.com |date=2010-06-21 |accessdate=2010-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

City of Stoughton, Media Services Department operates a [[Public, educational, and government access]] (PEG) [[cable TV]] channel ''[[WSTO TV]]''

==Events==
The [[coffee break]] is said to have originated in Stoughton, when the immigrant men became employed en masse at T.G. Mandt's wagon factory, leaving their wives to fill the shortages at the tobacco warehouses, who agreed to work under the condition that they were allowed to go home every morning and afternoon to tend to chores and, of course, drink coffee. The city of Stoughton celebrates the coffee break every summer with the Stoughton Coffee Break Festival.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stoughtonwi.com/coffee.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

The first weekend in December marks Stoughton's Victorian Holiday Weekend celebrating the city's wealth of beautifully preserved Victorian homes and commercial buildings. Events include a Victorian Holiday Ball featuring Period dances in a casual atmosphere, a production of the Nutcracker Ballet, carriage rides, a silent decorated fire truck parade, children's parade, and more.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.victorianholidayweekend.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oconomowoc''' {{IPAc-en|oʊ|ˈ|k|ɑː|n|əm|ə|w|ɑː|k}} is a city in [[Waukesha County, Wisconsin|Waukesha County]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States]]. The name was derived from Coo-no-mo-wauk, the [[Potawatomi language|Potawatomi]] term for &quot;waterfall.&quot; The population was 15,712 at the 2010 census. The city is partially adjacent to the [[Oconomowoc (town), Wisconsin|Town of Oconomowoc]] and near the [[Oconomowoc Lake, Wisconsin|Village of Oconomowoc Lake]].

==History==
Before 1700, this region was inhabited by [[Potawatomi]] peoples descended from [[Woodland Indians]] known as &quot;mound builders.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Mary A. Kane, ''Oconomowoc'' (Charleston: Arcadia Publishing, 2006), 7. &lt;/ref&gt; There are also reports that the Sauk Indian chief [[Black Hawk (Sauk leader)|Black Hawk]] had a campsite on [[Oconomowoc Lake, Wisconsin|Oconomowoc Lake]].&lt;ref&gt;Mary A. Kane, ''Oconomowoc'' (Charleston: Arcadia Publishing, 2006), 7. &lt;/ref&gt;  

The first white person recorded in the area was Amable (sometimes spelled Aumable) Vicau, brother-in-law of [[Solomon Juneau]], one of the founders of [[Milwaukee]].&lt;ref&gt;Wally Moyle and M.T.R., &quot;A Junior Historian's Draper Inquiry,&quot; ''The Wisconsin Magazine of History'' 36, no. 3 (1953), 205.&lt;/ref&gt; Vicau established a trading post 1827.&lt;ref&gt;W.O. Roberts, &quot;[[Early Days in Oconomowoc]],&quot; Oconomowoc Free Press (29 October 1904). &lt;/ref&gt; White settlers soon followed beginning in 1830. 

In April 1837, New York native Charles Sheldon staked a 160-acre claim on the east shore of what is now Fowler Lake, registering it with the Land Bank of Milwaukee on 21 April 1837.&lt;ref&gt;Mary A. Kane, ''Oconomowoc'' (Charleston: Arcadia Publishing, 2006), 7. &lt;/ref&gt; A few days later, H.W. Blanchard acquired a claim adjacent to that of Sheldon on the other side of the lake, which he later sold off to Philo Brewer. Brewer constructed what some consider to be the first residence within Oconomowoc's current legal limits, a site now located at 517 N. Lake Road, between La Belle and Fowler lakes.&lt;ref&gt;Mary A. Kane, ''Oconomowoc'' (Charleston: Arcadia Publishing, 2006), 7. &lt;/ref&gt; The first recorded birth was of Eliza Jane Dewey on 19 January 1840, in the lodgings above a chair factory located at 116 N. Walnut.&lt;ref name=&quot;summit55&quot;&gt;Jean Lindsay Johnson, ''Illustrious Oconomowoc'' (Franklin Publishers, 1978), 13. &lt;/ref&gt; The first recorded death was that of Jerusha Foster, who died somewhere between the ages of 30 and 36 on 19 March 1841.&lt;ref name=&quot;summit55&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=40415712 Jerusha Foster at Find A Grave]&lt;/ref&gt; Initially buried at Zion Church point, she was eventually re-interred at Nashotah Mission.&lt;ref&gt;Newnham, Mary. 1915. [http://www.worldmapsonline.com/historicalmaps/1W-WI-OW-1890.htm &quot;Eighty Odd Years Ago: Reminiscences of Oconomowoc and Vicinity.&quot;] ''Oconomowoc Enterprise'' (July).&lt;/ref&gt; 

Oconomowoc was incorporated as a town in 1844, although residents had to go to [[Summit, Waukesha County, Wisconsin|Summit]] to get their mail until 1845.&lt;ref name=&quot;summit57&quot;&gt;Barbara Barquist and David Barquist, &quot;Oconomowoc,&quot; in ''The Summit of Oconomowoc: 150 Years of Summit Town'' (Summit History Group, 1987), 57. &lt;/ref&gt; Travel and communication links between the new town and nearby cities were quickly established. The Watertown Plank Road was extended to connect Oconomowoc to the nearby towns of Milwaukee, Waukesha, Pewaukee, and Watertown in 1850.&lt;ref name=&quot;summit57&quot; /&gt; Such infrastructure encouraged further settlement, and by 1853 the town grew to a population of 250, with ten stores, three hotels, one [[gristmill]] and one [[sawmill]] (both located near the present Lake Road bridge), and a schoolhouse.&lt;ref&gt;Wisconsin Historical Society, &quot;[[Oconomowoc: A Brief History]],&quot; (2009). &lt;/ref&gt; The first passenger train from Milwaukee arrived in Oconomowoc on 14 December 1854, part of the Milwaukee and Watertown Railroad Company's rapidly expanding Milwaukee &amp; Mississippi line.&lt;ref&gt;Axel Lorenzsonn, ''Steam &amp; Cinders: The Advent of Railroads in Wisconsin'' (Wisconsin Historical Society, 2010), 187. &lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 1870s, Oconomowoc started to became a summer resort-town for wealthy families from across the Midwest. Large houses were soon established around the town's lakes, particularly Oconomowoc Lake and Lac La Belle. The population grew so much that Oconomowoc changed from town to city in 1875, and, by 1880, had a population of 3,000.&lt;ref&gt;Mary A. Kane, ''Oconomowoc'' (Charleston: Arcadia Publishing, 2006), 8. &lt;/ref&gt;  

In 2003, Oconomowoc acquired Pabst Farms from the Town of Summit. Pabst Farms, which had previously been owned by the Pabst family, is being developed as a mixture of commercial and residential property.

On April 2, 2008, a gas line exploded just west of downtown, destroying the First Baptist Church on West Wisconsin Avenue. The church, which was built in 1913, was completely destroyed, except for its bell tower frame. The cause of the explosion was from an old capped off gas line (capped in 1972–73 some time) collapsing due to a construction machine as utility work was being done on Wisconsin Avenue in preparation for reconstruction of the street.&lt;ref name=&quot;explosion_oconomowoc&quot;&gt;{{cite web |first=Jacqui |last=Seibel |coauthors=Sink, Lisa; Rinard, Amy |title=Blast levels church |url=http://www.jsonline.com/news/waukesha/29408284.html |work=JSOnline |publisher=Journal Sentinel |date=April 3, 2008 |accessdate=May 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The city of Manawa grew up south of a sawmill built on the [[Little Wolf River]] in 1871 by J.M. and Harley Rounds and Robert Pugmire. The river was bridged in three places by the 1880s, making Manawa a focus of all traffic through the town. The timbered bridge at the sawmill was replaced with a steel truss bridge in 1902. About a mile downstream, the railroad crossed the river on a plate girder bridge, and barely a half-mile below the railroad trestle, the lower bridge, originally built of lumber, was replaced by a three-arch stone bridge in 1902.

The city was cradled in the lower crook of the reverse-S made by the river, with the streets of the city laid out in three distinct parts. A northern part in sixteen blocks was drawn just south of the sawmill and became the central business district through most of the city's life. A central sliver of just barely eight blocks, a mix of businesses and residences, lay on the south side of the railroad. And to the south, a square of twenty blocks was laid out around the river crossing about a half-mile below the railroad. Although this was the largest part of Manawa to be platted, and appeared to be laid out as the civic center of the city, complete with a town square, it fell into decline, and only in more modern times has begun to grow again.

For a short time after the post office opened in 1872, under the postmaster Elbert Scott, the city was known as Elberton. The name Manawa was formally adopted in 1874. According to local folklore, &quot;Manawa&quot; means &quot;long bow,&quot; and was the name of a Native American killed in a duel near the lower river crossing.

Manawa was only very sparsely settled before 1860. Before that, most residents of the town clustered in the area known as [[Little Wolf, Wisconsin]].

==Education==
The School District of Manawa, which serves the city of Manawa, at one time operated only rural schools. The district had one rural school for kindergarten in [[Symco, Wisconsin|Symco]]. It was reorganized on October 25, 1962. It now consists of The Elementary School (Pre-School - 6th grade) and Little Wolf Junior-Senior High School (7th - 12th.)

A school built on Depot Street in 1920 was added to and remodeled six times. In 1969, following a fire that destroyed part of that school, the Little Wolf High School was built. The school's mascot is a wolf.

Sports available in the schools include football, basketball, wrestling, volleyball, softball, baseball, track, bowling, and golf. Cheerleading is also available, but only for children in third through sixth grade. The pee-wee junior (black &amp; black A), pee-wee (white), and [[Pop Warner Little Scholars|Pop Warner]] (red) football team (3rd - 6th grade) is called the Manawa Cowboys, while the 7th through 12th grade football team is the Manawa &quot;The Big Bad&quot; Wolves (black and red). The school colors are red, black, and white.

There is also a parochial school, St. Paul Lutheran School and Church, which serves preschool through 8th grade. Connected to St. Paul's is a day care center, Little Lambs Child Care.

==Events==
Manawa hosts a Midwestern Rodeo that is held every year in July, and consists of a rodeo [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] parade and four rodeo performances.

The Rodeo dates for 2012 are: June 29, June 30, and July 1.

2013 dates: July 5-6-7

2014 dates: July 4-5-6

2015 dates: July 3-4-5

The slogan for the rodeo is &quot;It's Big - It's Wild - It's Western!&quot;

In the city the population included 27.2% under the age of 18, 10.1% from 18 to 24, 31.5% from 25 to 44, 19.0% from 45 to 64, and 12.2% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 34 years. For every 100 females there were 96.7 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 93.2 males.

==History==
Pre-[[Clovis culture]] settlements were discovered in the greater Kenosha area in the late 20th century. These prehistoric settlements date approximately to the era of the [[Wisconsin glaciation]].&lt;ref&gt;Wasion, David.  [http://www.sas.org/tcs/weeklyIssues_2005/2005-02-11/feature1/index.html &quot;The Mammoth Hunter: David Wasion's Quest for Pre-Clovis People in North America&quot;] ''The Citizen Scientist'', 11 February 2005&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paleo Indians]] first settled in the area at least 13,500 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Falk, Terrence.  [http://www.milwaukeemagazine.com/042004/bones.asp &quot;Bones to Pick&quot;] ''[[Milwaukee Magazine]]'', April 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Potawatomi]] originally named the area ''gnozhé'' (&quot;place of the [[Pike (fish)|pike]]&quot;).

The early name by the [[Ojibwa]] Indians is reported as Masu-kinoja. This describes the place of spawning trout as &quot;Trout (Pike) come all at same time&quot;.  There were thousands of fish entering the rivers from Lake Michigan. Harvesting these fish provided food for the coming months. There is also a town of Masu-kegan in Michigan.

The first white settlers were part of the Western Emigration Company. They arrived in the early 1830s from [[Hannibal (town), New York|Hannibal]] and [[Troy, New York]], led by John Bullen, Jr., who sought to purchase enough land for a town.  Thwarted in Milwaukee and Racine, the group arrived at Pike Creek on 6 June 1835, building log and later frame homes.  The first school and churches followed by 1835, with platting completed in 1836.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~wikenosh/mfrank.htm |title=Ancestry.com - Genealogy and Family History Records |publisher=Rootsweb.ancestry.com |date=2001-04-22 |accessdate=2011-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As more settlers arrived and the first post office was established, the community was first known as '''Pike''' in 1836. In the ensuing years the area became an important Great Lakes shipping port, and the village was once again renamed, this time to '''Southport'''. (This is still the name of a southeast-side neighborhood, park, and elementary school, as well as several businesses).

In 1850, another change brought the growing city (and later Kenosha County) its current title, an Anglicized version of the early name ''Kinoje''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&amp;term_id=3368&amp;term_type_id=2&amp;term_type_text=Places&amp;letter=K |title=Origin of the name |publisher=Wisconsinhistory.org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kenoshans often refer affectionately to their city as &quot;K-Town&quot; and &quot;Keno&quot; (the latter adopted by some local businesses).

Between 1902 and 1988, Kenosha produced millions of automobiles and trucks&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kenoshanews.com/news/citys_auto_history_reaches_back_more_than_100_years_4790377.html City’s auto history reaches back more than 100 years]{{dead link|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; under marques such as [[Jeffery (automobile)|Jeffery]], [[Rambler (automobile)|Rambler]], [[Nash Motors|Nash]], [[Hudson Motor Car Company|Hudson]], [[LaFayette Motors|LaFayette]], and [[American Motors Corporation]] (AMC). A [[prototype]] [[steam car]] was built in Kenosha by the Sullivan-Becker engineering firm in 1900. Two years later the [[Thomas B. Jeffery Company]], builders of the Sterling bicycle, began production of the [[Rambler (automobile)|Rambler]] runabout. In 1902 Rambler and [[Oldsmobile]] were the first cars to employ mass-production techniques. The 1902 Rambler was also the first automobile to incorporate a [[steering wheel]], rather than use the then-common [[tiller]]-controlled steering. In 1916 Jeffery was purchased by auto executive [[Charles W. Nash]] and became [[Nash Motors]]. In May 1954, Nash acquired Detroit-based [[Hudson Motor Car Company|Hudson]] and the new firm was named [[American Motors Corporation]]. A {{convert|47|acre|m2|adj=on}} west side park and an elementary school are named for Charles W. Nash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nash.kusd.edu/ |title=Kenosha Unified School District |publisher=Nash.kusd.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In  partnership with French automaker [[Renault]], AMC manufactured several models in Kenosha in the early 1980s, including the Alliance, which won the 1983 “Car of The Year” award from [[Motor Trend]] magazine. Two decades earlier, AMC's 1963 Rambler Classic had also received the award.  In 1987 Renault sold its controlling interest in AMC to [[Chrysler Corporation]], which had already contracted with AMC for the production of its M-body mid-sized cars at the Kenosha plant. The AMC Lakefront plant (1960–88), a smaller facility, was demolished in 1990 (a chimney-demolition ceremony that June drew 10,000 spectators) and was redeveloped into upscale HarborPark,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kenoshakorner.com/post/636062/HARBOR-PARK-a-brief-history |title=Harbor Park: a brief history |publisher=Kenoshakorner.com |date=2008-08-11 |accessdate=2011-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; with its rambling lakeside condominiums, large recreational marina, water park and promenades, artworks, sculptures, fountains (including the 2007 Christopher Columbus fountain), the Kenosha Public Museum, which opened in 2000, and the Civil War Museum, which opened in 2008, all connected by the Kenosha Electric Railway streetcar system.[[File:Kenosha Harborpark.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Harborpark]]

From the start of the 20th century through the 1930s, many Italian, Irish, Polish and German immigrants, many of them skilled craftsmen, made their way to the city and contributed to the city's construction, culture, architecture, music and literature.

Kenosha has 21 locations and three districts listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]&lt;ref name=&quot;nris&quot;&gt;{{NRISref|version=2010a}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the Library Park, Third Avenue, and the Civic Center historic districts. The city has a Kenosha Landmarks Commission, and among the many local city-designated landmarks are the 1929 YMCA at 711 59th Place, the Manor House at 6536 Third Avenue, the John McCaffary House at 5732 13th Court, the St. Matthew Episcopal Church at 5900 Seventh Avenue, the Washington Park Clubhouse at 2205 Washington Road, and the Justin Weed House at 3509 Washington Road.

In June 1993, the city installed reproductions of the historic Sheridan LeGrande [[street light]]s that were specially designed for Kenosha by [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]] Electric in 1928; these can be seen on Sixth Avenue between 54th and 59th Streets. A classic two-mile (3&amp;nbsp;km) downtown electric streetcar system was opened on June 17, 2000.

==Law and government==
Kenosha has a mayor, who is the chief executive, and a city administrator, who is the chief operating officer. The mayor is elected every four years. The city's Common Council consists of 17 aldermen from Kenosha's 17 districts (each district having several wards), elected for two-year terms in even-numbered years.

The mayor of Kenosha for four terms beginning in April 1992 was [[John Martin Antaramian]], the longest-serving mayor in the city's history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brownfieldassociation.org/WI_jAntaramian.htm John M. Antaramian biographical note, National Brownfield Association]{{dead link|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2006, Antaramian was awarded the Robert B. Bell, Sr. Best Public Partner Award for his advocacy towards quality real estate development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biztimes.com/daily/2006/10/16/outgoing-kenosha-mayor-to-receive-real-estate-partner-award |title=Outgoing Kenosha mayor to receive real estate partnership award. |publisher=Biztimes.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the [[Mayors Against Illegal Guns Coalition]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mayorsagainstillegalguns.org/html/about/members.shtml| title=Mayors Against Illegal Guns: Coalition Members}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[bi-partisan]] group with a stated goal of &quot;making the public safer by getting illegal guns off the streets.&quot; The Coalition is co-chaired by [[Boston]] Mayor [[Thomas Menino]] and [[New York City]] Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]].

Antaramian announced during 2007 that he would not seek reelection in 2008. Former alderman Keith Bosman was elected mayor for a four-year term in the April 2008 spring elections.

Kenosha is represented by [[Paul Ryan]] (R) in the [[United States House of Representatives]], and by [[Ron Johnson (Wisconsin politician)|Ron Johnson]] (R) and [[Tammy Baldwin]] (D) in the [[United States Senate]]. [[Robert Wirch]] (D) represents Kenosha in the [[Wisconsin State Senate]], and [[Peter Barca]] (D) and [[Tod Ohnstad]] (D) represent Kenosha in the [[Wisconsin State Assembly]].

==Economy==
[[File:Vfiles5759.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Uptown Kenosha]]
Years ago a busy center of manufacturing, Kenosha is today considered a &quot;[[bedroom community]]&quot; within the Chicago-Milwaukee [[Megalopolis (city type)|megalopolis]], often attracting new residents from Illinois, which leads to Kenosha's frequent appellation as Chicago's northernmost suburb. With several area transportation options, many residents commute to their places of employment. According to county statistics, 49% of Kenosha's workforce commutes outside of Kenosha County to their positions. Many travel northward towards Milwaukee or south into the Chicago area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.co.kenosha.wi.us/ |title=Kenosha County, WI - Home |publisher=Co.kenosha.wi.us |date=2011-06-30 |accessdate=2011-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kenosha does have some of its own employment, and is not a &quot;typical&quot; suburb; in fact, many locals consider neighboring communities Pleasant Prairie and Somers to be suburbs of Kenosha.

A June 2009 study by the [[Milken Institute]] (&quot;North America's High-Tech Economy: The Geography of Knowledge-Based Industries&quot;) reported that Kenosha placed in the national top-50 high-tech economies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Newgeography.com |url=http://www.newgeography.com/content/00822-north-america%E2%80%99s-high-tech-economy-the-geography-knowledge-based-industries |title=North America’s High Tech Economy: The Geography of Knowledge-Based Industries |publisher=Newgeography.com |date=2009-11-18 |accessdate=2011-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Public Policy Forum]] reported that Kenosha's personal-income levels have been sharply rising;{{When|date=January 2010}} the latest local gain stands at $30.3 million, in contrast to a personal-income drop of $434 million within other adjoining southeastern-Wisconsin communities (except for neighboring [[Walworth County, Wisconsin|Walworth County]], which had a $3.3 million gain in the latest statistics.){{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} The Kenosha Board of Realtors reported on March 24, 2010 that Kenosha-area home sales were outpacing the national home-sales trends for most of 2009 and into the new decade.

[[File:Kenosha Harborpark 2.jpg|thumb|right|230px|HarborPark overlooking Kenosha Harbor]]

Today, Kenosha's employment demographics are mainly [[White-collar worker|white-collar]]. The city's largest employer is the multi-level educational system (this includes Kenosha Public Schools as well as [[UW-Parkside]]), and Kenosha's largest private employer is [[Abbott Laboratories]] in Abbott Park, Illinois which has recently purchased {{convert|400|acre|km2}} within Kenosha County at Highways C at [[Interstate 94]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wisconsinbiotech.org/biotech_news/index.php?category_id=578&amp;subcategory_id=2583].&lt;/ref&gt; Kenosha is also home of [[UAW]] Local 72.

===Business and industry===
[[Snap-on]] Tools world headquarters are located in Kenosha. In decades past, Kenosha also hosted a number of manufacturing firms, among them American Brass (later Outokumpu Copper/Outokumpu American Brass Company), [[Simmons Bedding Company]], the Samuel Lowe publishing firm, Kenosha Full Fashioned Mills, Solar Lamp Company, [[Jockey International]], the MacWhyte Wire Rope Company, Dynamatic, Frost Company, G. LeBlanc, and [[American Motors Corporation]]. Most of these facilities have long since been cleared and the real-estate converted into parklands, high-end residential developments, commercial shopping districts, a school campus, or held in [[land-banking]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Kenosha also has a number of [[light industrial]] and distribution companies, nearly all located in [[business park]]s outside the city.

===Tourism===
[[Tourism]] has a significant and growing impact on Kenosha's economy. According to the Kenosha Convention and Visitors Bureau, 2006 Kenosha-area tourism expenditures reached a record $222.5 million, which translated into approximately 5,220 full-time-job equivalents. During 2007, the Kenosha-area revenue from tourism rose to a record $224.6 million (or a 5,267 full-time-job equivalency) despite a 1.4% statewide tourism slowdown. Kenosha's tourism activity and revenue is now within the top 20% of all of Wisconsin's 72 counties. Surveys show that most visitors to Kenosha shop at nearby Pleasant Prairie's Prime Outlets strip mall, which contains factory outlets for a diverse mix of retailers, and stay at local hotels and motels, while the city's extensive [[Lake Michigan]] beaches and HarborPark facilities attract 36% of all tourists, and 34.1% use the municipal [[streetcar line]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

Kenosha-area tourism saw growth in 2008 despite the national economic downturn, bringing in a record $225.2 million, an increase of $600,000 over 2007 and a 147% increase since 1994. This placed Greater Kenosha in 14th place for tourism among Wisconsin's 72 counties in 2008. This is thought to be because of an increase in nearby, short vacations, or [[staycation]]s, due to the economic downturn, with Kenosha attracting residents of the nearby [[Milwaukee]] and [[Chicago]] areas.

The opening of Kenosha's $15 million Civil War Museum in June 2008 was a major tourism-related event. Other attractions include the [[Dinosaur Discovery Museum]], the Kenosha Public Museum, the Longaberger Basket Fest, [[Mars Cheese Castle]] and the opening of a holiday-season [[Jelly Belly]] retail outlet. The Kenosha History Center houses UAW memorabilia as well as an AMC Pacer.

2009 brought a number of new events to Kenosha, including the inaugural Wisconsin Marathon, which saw nearly 2,000 runners at the Lake Michigan shoreline on May 2. The second annual &quot;A Salute to Freedom&quot; from June 12 to June 14 celebrated the completion of the Civil War Museum, and the TREK Women’s Triathlon Series made its debut on July 12 at Prairie Springs Park.

===Real estate and housing===
The number of households in Kenosha County increased by nearly 80% from 1990 to 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=ascedia.com |url=http://www.kaba.org/community/housing.htm |title=Kenosha Area Business Alliance |publisher=Kaba.org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicating the community is rapidly expanding to accommodate new businesses and employees in the Kenosha area.
[[File:Cfiles22507.jpg|thumb|right|230px|A Kenosha neighborhood]]
Number of households:
* 1990: 47,029
* 2000: 56,057
* 2005: 58,715

2005 housing statistics:
* Total housing units: 67,568
* Owner occupied: 42,197
* Median value of homes: $167,500
* Renter occupied: 16,518
* Median rent paid: $722
* Rental vacancy rate: 11.1%

In March 2008, the Public Policy Forum reported that Kenosha's real-estate valuations rose by 7.6%, most likely as a result of heavy migration by Chicago professionals who have resettled in Kenosha.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

==Transportation==
[[File:Kenosha Streetcar.jpg|thumb|right|230px|A Kenosha [[streetcar]]]]
{{See also|Streetcars in Kenosha, Wisconsin}}
Kenosha has been served by rail service to and from [[Chicago]] since May 19, 1855,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jsonline.com/news/opinion/29249494.html |title=Bands of iron |publisher=Jsonline.com |date=2007-02-04 |accessdate=2011-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the predecessors to the [[Chicago and North Western Railway]], the Milwaukee and Chicago Railway Company (originally the [[Illinois Parallel Railroad]]) and the original &quot;Lake Shore Railroad&quot; (later the Green Bay, Milwaukee and Chicago Railway) were officially joined with great ceremony just south of today's 52nd Street. Passenger service began on May 28, 1866, and it continues to the present day.

Kenosha has the only [[Metra]] [[Kenosha (Metra)|station]] in Wisconsin, with nine inbound and nine outbound trains each weekday. Passenger ridership on the Kenosha line was up by a slight 0.06%  in 2009, while elsewhere on the 11-route Metra system, passenger counts dropped by 5.2 percent. Not all [[Union Pacific/North Line]] trains terminate and originate in Kenosha. Most of them terminate at [[Waukegan, Illinois]], to the south of Kenosha.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metrarail.com/Sched/cnw_n/cnwn.shtml |title=Metrarail |publisher=Metrarail |date= |accessdate=2011-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since June 2000, a two-mile (3&amp;nbsp;km) [[streetcar]] line has served the downtown area and HarborPark, connecting the Metra station with downtown and several area parks. Kenosha is one of the smallest cities in America with any type of streetcar system today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.suntimes.com/lifestyles/travel/midwest/1683908,kenosha-hoekstra-wisconsin-072609.stng Diners, drive-in theater, streetcars and a tiki bar: Wisconsin city offers charm aplenty just 50 miles from Chicago]{{dead link|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2005 the city council authorized a study on the expansion of streetcar service in order to  connect the city's downtown with the uptown business districts flanking 63rd Street and 22nd Avenue.

In addition to a streetcar line, Kenosha has a [[Kenosha Transit|city bus network]] that includes eight routes. Kenosha was the first city to color-code transit routes (with the Blue, Green, Red, and Orange Lines), and also the first city to use electric trolley buses in full transit service, both occurring on February 14, 1932.&lt;ref&gt;Canfield, Joseph M. TM: The Milwaukee Electric Railway &amp; Light Company, CERA Bulletin 112. Chicago: Central Electric Railfans' Assoc., 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

Kenosha is served by two intercity bus systems. [[Wisconsin Coach Lines]] buses stop in front of the city's Metra station, connecting riders to Racine, Milwaukee, and the [[O'Hare International Airport]] in western Chicago, and difficult to get to by train.{{dubious|date=November 2010}} The [[Western Kenosha County Transit]] Route 1 stops at Southport Plaza, connecting riders to [[Twin Lakes, Wisconsin|Twin Lakes]].

By highway, Kenosha is served mainly by [[Interstate 94]] which connects Chicago with Milwaukee, and thence west to the state capitol, [[Madison, Wisconsin]].

By [[passenger train]], Kenosha is also served by [[Amtrak]]'s [[Hiawatha (Amtrak)|Hiawatha Line]] service (from the [[Sturtevant (Amtrak station)|Sturtevant station]] in [[Racine County, WI|Racine County]]), with trains between Chicago and Milwaukee seven times daily. The Hiawatha serves commuters from Kenosha who work in either one of these two large cities.

In Kenosha County, numbered streets run east-west and numbered avenues north-south, with street numbering commencing with First Street on Kenosha County's northern border ([[County highway|County Trunk Highway]] KR) rather than at the city's center. (&quot;Roads&quot; are diagonal thoroughfares, &quot;Courts&quot; are short north-south avenues, and &quot;Places&quot; are short east-west streets.) The downtown area of Kenosha is located between 50th and 60th Streets. Avenue numbers increase as one heads west from the lakefront. This numbering system continues through all of Kenosha County, ending at 408th Avenue to the west at the Kenosha-Walworth County line, while north-south roads end at the [[Illinois]] state line at 128th Street.

==Education==

===Higher education===

Kenosha is home to the [[University of Wisconsin-Parkside]] with over 5,000 students, [[Carthage College]] with over 2,000 students, and [[Gateway Technical College]].
[[Concordia University Wisconsin]], [[Cardinal Stritch University]], and [[National-Louis University]] all maintain Kenosha branch campuses.
In 2009, [[Herzing University]] opened its new Kenosha campus.

===Public schools===

The [[Kenosha Unified School District]] operates 23 public elementary schools, five middle schools, seven charter schools, and six major high schools:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kusd.edu/ |title=Kenosha Unified School District No. 1 |publisher=Kusd.edu |date=2011-07-01 |accessdate=2011-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mary D. Bradford High School]], [[George Nelson Tremper High School]], [[Indian Trail High School and Academy]], [[Lakeview Tech Academy]], [[Reuther Central High School]] and Harborside Academy, the latter a research school that uses the [[Outward Bound#Expeditionary Learning Outward Bound|Expeditionary Learning Outward Bound model]]; it was funded by the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://harborside.kusd.edu/about.html |title=Harborside Academy |publisher=Harborside.kusd.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; 80% of Kenosha's fourth-graders score 'proficient' and 'advanced' gradings on reading tests, according to [[National Assessment of Educational Progress]] tests.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.realtykenosha.com/school/&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction, Kenosha's 2008 public-school graduation rate of 84.1% was ahead of the national average.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.kenoshanews.com/news/unified_mirrors_classroom_diversity_trends_5071725.html |title=Unified mirrors classroom diversity trends |newspaper=Kenosha News |date=June 3, 2009 |first=Gary J. |last=Kunich }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Private schools===

Kenosha also has a number of parochial schools and independent academies, including St. Joseph Catholic Academy (4K- 12), All Saints Catholic School (preschool - 8), Bethany Lutheran School, Friedens Lutheran School, Christ Lutheran Academy, Kenosha [[Montessori]] School,  [[Shoreland Lutheran High School]], the Brompton Academy, [[Christian Life School]], and the LakeView Advanced Technology Center.  At the beginning of the 2011-2012 school year, St. Mary's and Holy Rosary became the two campuses of All Saints Catholic School. Both campuses operate as the same school with the same principal. St. Marks and St. Joseph High School have also done the same, conjoining to become Saint Joseph Catholic Academy. K-6 grades at the lower campus, and 7-12 grades at the upper campus. These combinations are due to steep enrollment drops in the recent years. A number of professional schools are also located within the city.

===Libraries===

The Kenosha Public Library, which is part of the Kenosha County Library System, operates in four locations throughout the city. [[Daniel H. Burnham]] designed the 1900 [[Beaux-Arts architecture]]d Gilbert M. Simmons Library, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kenosha.lib.wi.us/simmons.html Simmons Library], from the Kenosha Public Library&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health care==
Since 1992 Kenosha has hosted the [[Michael E. DeBakey]] Heart Institute of the Kenosha Hospital &amp; Medical Center, established in tribute to DeBakey’s pioneering efforts in cardiovascular surgery.

==Media==
The primary newspaper of Kenosha County is the ''[[Kenosha News]],'' a broadsheet with circulation of around 23,000 copies. The Happenings Magazine is an ad supported publication distributed at local businesses.

Kenosha is considered as part of the Milwaukee television market by [[A.C. Nielsen]]. [[Arbitron]] classifies Kenosha as part of the Chicago radio market.  Five major radio stations broadcast from Kenosha: News/Talk/Oldies [[WLIP]] (1050 AM), [[Gateway Technical College]]'s [[WGTD]] (91.1 FM), a member station of the [[Wisconsin Public Radio]] News &amp; Classical Music Network, rock [[WIIL]] (95.1 FM) and classic hits [[WWDV]] (96.9 FM), which [[simulcast]]s Chicago-based [[WDRV]] (97.1 FM). The Kenosha Convention and Visitors Bureau operates WPUR937 (1180 AM), a low-power [[tourist information]] station. Most of the AM and FM radio stations from Milwaukee and Chicago can be heard clearly in Kenosha.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radio-locator.com/cgi-bin/locate?select=city&amp;city=Kenosha,+WI&amp;x=0&amp;y=0&amp;sid= |title=Radio Stations in Kenosha, Wisconsin |publisher=Radio-locator.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[WPXE]] (Channel 55), owned by [[ION Television]], is Kenosha's only locally [[city of license|licensed]] television station. Its analog transmitter was based in northern Racine County, while the digital tower is in Milwaukee's tower farm site on the north side and the station's studios are just south of suburban [[Glendale, Wisconsin|Glendale]], so it serves the entire Milwaukee television market.

==Civic organizations==
There are several Civic Organizations that add to the rich benevolent spirit found in Kenosha. Such organizations contribute resources to various positive causes as well as knit the fabric of the community together:

Navy Club of the U.S.A.,
Free and Accepted Masons - Lodge 47,
Rotary Club International,
The Exchange Club,
Local VFW and American Legion Posts,
Kenosha Women's Club,
Kenosha Streetcar Society,
Danish Brotherhood Lodge #14.

==Culture==
[[File:Kenosha Public Museum.jpg|thumb|230px|right|The Kenosha Public Museum.]]
Kenosha's three downtown museums, the [[Kenosha Public Museum]], the Civil War Museum and the Dinosaur Discovery Museum, are [[Smithsonian Institution]] affiliates.

Completed in 2001, the Kenosha Public Museum is located on the [[Lake Michigan]] shoreline. Its main exhibit is a prehistoric [[Mammoth|Woolly Mammoth]] skeleton uncovered in western Kenosha in 1992. The bones revealed new clues about ancient American history; cut-marks on the bones indicated that the animals were butchered by humans using stone tools. [[Carbon dating]] indicated their age to be 12,500 radiocarbon years years old or 14,500 calendar years old, one thousand radiocarbon years earlier than the previously-accepted presence of humans in the Americas. The museum also displays other Ice Age and fine-art exhibits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kenosha.org/museum/index.html |title=Kenosha Public Museum website |publisher=Kenosha.org |date=2011-04-30 |accessdate=2011-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kenosha History Center is within the 1917 City water treatment plant on Simmons Island adjoining the 1866 [[Kenosha Light|Kenosha Light Station]], and showcases the history of Kenosha from the Indians and the first settlements to the present day. The 1906 [[Kenosha North Pier Light]] is also nearby.

The Clark House Museum, located in the Village of Pewaukee, was originally a stage coach inn on the Watertown Plank Road that ran from Milwaukee to Watertown. The inn was built by Mosely Clark, the son of Pewaukee's first settler, Asa Clark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The History of the Settlement and Progress of Pewaukee, Wisconsin|year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Clark House remained in the Clark family until the death of Marietta Clark Larson, great-granddaughter of Asa, in 1984. In 1992 the Pewaukee Area Historical Society purchased the property.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

The museum displays include an exhibits on Native American settlement with emphasis on the [[Potawatomi]] and Waukesha Beach, a popular amusement park on the shore of Pewaukee Lake.

==History==
An article dated March 16, 1916 from the long defunct newspaper ''The Nekoosa Tribune'' detailing the early history of Nekoosa may be found at the [[Wisconsin Historical Society]] web site.  It is a letter written by a resident to Nekoosa High School students to support them writing a history term paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nekoosa History|url=http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/wlhba/articleView.asp?pg=1&amp;orderby=&amp;id=13553&amp;pn=1&amp;adv=yes&amp;hdl=&amp;np=&amp;ln=&amp;fn=&amp;q=&amp;y1=&amp;y2=&amp;ci=nekoosa&amp;co=&amp;mhd=&amp;shd=|publisher=The Nekoosa Tribune|accessdate=10 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Point Basse]]'''&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;Five rapids covering a distance of about three miles in this area were referred to as Nekoosa (swift water) by the Chippewa Indians, who made their campground on high Swallow Rock overlooking the rapids. Wakeley's tavern served as a rendezvous and resting place for the river  traveler and lumber raftsman. Wakeley's was the nucleus for the development of a settlement named Point Basse (low point). The name was later changed to Nekoosa.

The settlement became a key town during the colorful era when lumber was rafted down the river from the pineries of the North to Mississippi River markets.

Daniel Whitney built the first sawmill on the Wisconsin River here at Whitney's Rapids in 1831 making Nekoosa the birthplace of Wood County. From this first harnessing of the river's power developed scores of power facilities making the Wisconsin River the hardest worked river in the world.&quot; [Point Basse historical marker, erected 1963]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=1109 Point Basse Marker&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Economy==

===Paper mill===
Employment in Nekoosa has long been dominated by paper making.  The Nekoosa Paper Company, incorporated in 1893, constructed a mill on the [[Wisconsin River]].  In 1908 it merged with a paper company in nearby [[Port Edwards, Wisconsin|Port Edwards]], forming the Nekoosa Edwards Paper Company, or NEPCO.&lt;ref&gt;J. Marshall Buehler. ''The Nekoosa Story: A Commemorative History of Nekoosa Papers Inc.'', Port Edwards, Wis.: Nekoosa Papers, 1987. 169p.

Now it will discuss a sweetened deal&quot; LA Times, November 20, 1989]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2001 the mill was sold to Canadian paper company [[Domtar]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.domtar.com/en/paper-locations/paper-mill_nekoosa.asp Domtar corporate web site description]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.hbs.edu/hc/lehman/chrono.html?company=great_northern_nekoosa_corporation &quot;Great Northern Nekoosa Corporation&quot;, Lehman Brothers Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stocklobster.com/3775.html Great Northern Nekoosa Corporation Stock Certificate &amp; History]&lt;/ref&gt;
The Nekoosa mill is noteworthy for being the original home of a cutting-edge paper machine first shown at the [[Columbian Exposition|1893 Columbian Exhibition]]. The machine was moved in 1923 to a sister mill in Port Edwards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://paperindustryweb.com/1893fair.htm The Beloit Iron Works Columbian Machine]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Nekoosa has four schools: Humke Elementary School, Alexander Middle School, Nekoosa High School, and Nekoosa Academy. A new school designed specifically to teach [[Ho-Chunk]] heritage and history has been added to the district.

'''Prairie du Chien''' is a city in and the [[county seat]] of [[Crawford County, Wisconsin|Crawford County]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States]].  The population was 5,911 at the 2010 census. Its Zip Code is 53821.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zipinfo.com/cgi-local/zipsrch.exe?cnty=cnty&amp;ac=ac&amp;zip=Prairie+du+Chien%2C+WI&amp;Go=Go ZipInfo.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Often referred to as Wisconsin's second oldest city,&lt;ref&gt;''1929 [[Wisconsin Blue Book]]'' p. 629 http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/WI.WIBlueBk1929 (&quot;Prairie du Chien second oldest settlement in Wisconsin&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt; Prairie du Chien was established as a European settlement by [[French people|French]] [[voyageurs]] in the late seventeenth century. The city is located near the confluence of the [[Wisconsin River|Wisconsin]] and [[Mississippi River]]s, a strategic point along the [[Fox-Wisconsin Waterway]] that connects the [[Great Lakes]] with the Mississippi.

Early French visitors to the site found it occupied by a group of [[Fox Indians]] led by a [[Tribal chief|chief]] whose name ''Alim'' meant ''Chien'' in [[French language|French]] (Dog in [[English language|English]]). The French [[explorers]] named the location ''Prairie du Chien'', French for &quot;Dog's Prairie&quot;.  The American anglicized pronunciation is &quot;prairie doo sheen&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thislife.org/Radio_Episode.aspx?episode=360 This American Life]: Both Marti, the interviewee who is a native of Prairie du Chien, as well as the interviewer, Ira Glass, pronounce it as &quot;doo sheen&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Originally this name applied only to the plain upon which the settlement is located, but it was later extended to mean the city as well. The city of Prairie du Chien is located between the [[Prairie du Chien (town), Wisconsin|Town of Prairie du Chien]] and the [[Bridgeport, Wisconsin|Town of Bridgeport]].

==History==
[[Image:MarquettePlaque.jpg|thumbnail|left|Plaque for Marquette]]
The first [[Europe]]ans to reach Prairie du Chien were the [[France|French]] explorers [[Jacques Marquette]] and [[Louis Joliet]], who arrived by canoe on June 17, 1673, discovering a route to the [[Mississippi River]]. Later travel between French [[Canada]] and the Mississippi River passed through Prairie du Chien, although routes via the [[Illinois River]] were also used. In 1685, the French explorer [[Nicolas Perrot]] established a [[trading post]] in the area as part of the large and lucrative French [[fur trade]] industry. After Americans entered the trade in the nineteenth century, [[John Jacob Astor]] built the [[Astor Fur Warehouse]], an important building in the regional fur trade whose business was done in Prairie du Chien. The significance of Prairie du Chien as a center of the fur trade did not diminish until the mid-nineteenth century.

In 1763, when [[Great Britain]] defeated France in the [[French and Indian War]] (part of the [[Seven Years War]]), it took &quot;possession&quot; of the French territory in [[North America]], including Prairie du Chien. The British expanded the fur trade during their occupation of the area. During the [[American Revolutionary War]], the city was used as a meeting point for British troops and their [[Native Americans of the United States|Native American]] allies. After the American victory, the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]] granted the area to the new [[United States|United States of America]], but the British and their Loyalists were slow to withdraw. Only after the [[War of 1812]] did the city become fully American.

The US was slow to present any authority over Prairie du Chien, but late in the War of 1812 when the government realized the importance of holding the site to prevent British attacks from Canada, it began construction of [[Fort Shelby (Wisconsin)|Fort Shelby]] in 1814. In July, British soldiers captured the fort during the [[Siege of Prairie du Chien]]. The British maintained control over the city until the war's end in 1815.  Not wanting another invasion through Prairie du Chien, the Americans constructed [[Fort Crawford]] in 1816. 

The fort was the site of the negotiations and signing of the [[Treaty of Prairie du Chien]] (1825 and 1829), by which the [[Fox (tribe)|Fox]] and [[Sauk people|Sauk]] ceded much of their land to the US. Representing them and the United Nations of the [[Chippewa]], [[Ottawa]] and [[Pottawatomie]] in the 1829 negotiations was [[Billy Caldwell]], of Scots-Irish and Mohawk descent.  He became involved with the Pottawatomie after moving to the US as a young man from Canada.

In 1829, the army doctor [[William Beaumont]] carried out many of his famous experiments on [[digestion]] in the [[hospital]] of Fort Crawford. Beaumont's discoveries are still the basis of current knowledge on the human digestive process.

Col. [[Zachary Taylor]], who later became the 12th [[U.S. President]], was the commanding officer at Fort Crawford during the [[Black Hawk War]] of 1832. Taylor oversaw the surrender of Black Hawk in Prairie du Chien.  Lt. [[Jefferson Davis]], who later became president of the [[Confederate States of America]], was stationed at Fort Crawford at the same time.  Here Jefferson Davis met Zachary Taylor's daughter, [[Sarah Knox Taylor|Sarah &quot;Knoxie&quot; Taylor]], whom he married in 1835.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&amp;term_id=9139&amp;keyword=davis Davis, Jefferson (in Wisconsin)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Prairie du Chien map 1870.gif|thumb|left|Illustration of Prairie du Chien in 1870]]
Outside the walls of the fort, early nineteenth century life in Prairie du Chien was still dominated by the fur trade. Prairie du Chien's most well-known traders during this time were [[Michel Brisbois]], [[Joseph Rolette]], [[Nathan Myrick]], and [[Hercules L. Dousman]]. Dousman built a fortune in the fur trade, which, combined with income from investments in land, steamboats, and railroads, propelled him to become the first [[millionaire]] in Wisconsin. Dousman died in 1868, and his son, [[H. Louis Dousman]], inherited much of his fortune. In 1870 Louis Dousman used his inheritance to construct a luxurious Victorian mansion over the site of the former Fort Shelby. When Louis died unexpectedly in 1886, his family renamed the home &quot;[[Villa Louis]]&quot; in his memory. The Dousman family continued to occupy the home until 1913. Nearly 40 years later, in 1952, the mansion became Wisconsin's first state-operated historic site.

After the fur trade declined in the mid-nineteenth century, Prairie du Chien's attention shifted to agriculture and the railroad. Although the city was first connected to the [[Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad|Milwaukee &amp; Mississippi Railroad]] in 1857, the width of the Mississippi River posed a challenge for further expansion of the railroad into Iowa. This problem was temporarily solved by disassembling the trains at Prairie du Chien and ferrying them across the river to be put back on the tracks on the other side. A better solution was found by Michael Spettel and John Lawler, who designed a permanent [[pontoon bridge]] to span the river in 1874. Lawler took most of the credit for this invention, and made a small fortune through its operation. Lawler later donated property to establish two Catholic boarding schools in Prairie du Chien, St. Mary's Institute (now [[Mount Mary College]] of [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]]), and [[Campion High School]] in the later part of the century. Campion High School produced several notable alumni including [[Vicente Fox]], Congressman [[Leo Ryan]], Governor [[Patrick Lucey]], actors [[David Doyle (actor)|David Doyle]], [[George Wendt]], and [[Kevin McCarthy (actor)|Kevin McCarthy]], and writer [[Garry Wills]]. Campion was closed in 1975.

===History of municipal government===
Prairie du Chien was incorporated as the ''Borough of Prairie des Chiens'' on September 17, 1821 by the secretary of the [[Michigan Territory]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;An Act to incorporate the Borough of Prairie des Chiens&quot;, Sept. 17, 1821, in ''Laws of the Territory of Michigan vol. 1'' p. 236 http://books.google.com/books?id=_X7hAAAAMAAJ&lt;/ref&gt; It is the only municipality in Wisconsin other than [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]] to have been known as a borough, rather than a city, town, or village.&lt;ref&gt;David E. Spencer, &quot;Local Government in Wisconsin&quot;, in ''Collections of the State Historical Society of Wisconsin'', vol. XI. Madison, Wisconsin: Democrat Printing Co., 1888. p. 505 http://books.google.com/books?id=ECYPAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA505&lt;/ref&gt;  The borough existed for a few years before the government stopped operating in 1825&lt;ref&gt;Daniel S. Durrie, &quot;Annals of Prairie du Chien&quot;, 1872. http://ia310831.us.archive.org/3/items/earlyoutpostsofw01durr/earlyoutpostsofw01durr.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1828, the Prairie du Chien area became a part of the Town of St. Anthony, a town which included all of immense [[Crawford County, Wisconsin|Crawford County]]. (Crawford County itself included all of the western part of [[Michigan Territory]].) In 1849, the Town of Prairie du Chien was created, consisting of most of present-day Crawford County.  The city of Prairie du Chien was then incorporated in 1872.&lt;ref&gt;History of Crawford and Richland Counties, Wisconsin.

==Geography==
[[Image:Mississippi River at Prairie du Chien.jpg|thumb|Mississippi River|right|The [[Mississippi River]], viewed from [[St. Feriole Island]].]]

Prairie du Chien is located within the Mississippi River Valley, upon a long triangular plain that is bounded on the west by the [[Mississippi River]], on the south by the [[Wisconsin River]], and on the east-northeast by a series of tall bluffs. According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|6.36|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which, {{convert|5.63|sqmi|sqkm|2}} of it is land and {{convert|0.73|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.&lt;ref name =&quot;Gazetteer files&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the city's area encompasses most of the plain upon which it sits, portions of the plain extend outside city limits. Just north of the city limits, where the plain forms part of the [[Prairie du Chien (town), Wisconsin|Town of Prairie du Chien]], there is a small unincorporated settlement known locally as &quot;Frenchtown&quot;. The plain also extends outside the city southward into the [[Bridgeport, Wisconsin|Town of Bridgeport]]. Here the plain ends, becoming the wetlands of the Wisconsin River Delta.

Both inside and outside the city limits, backwaters of the Mississippi River occasionally break across the far west side of the plain to form small islands. While most of these islands are too small and flood prone to have ever been inhabited, one larger island just west of downtown Prairie du Chien formed the city's fourth ward until a 1965 flood prompted a mandatory relocation of the island's residents to higher ground. During the relocation project, most buildings with no special historical significance were removed. Now called &quot;St. Feriole Island&quot;, the island serves as a {{convert|240|acre|km2|1|sing=on}} city park.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wisconsincentral.net/Culture111807.html St. Feriole Island&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is close to [[Wyalusing State Park]] in Wisconsin, and [[Effigy Mounds National Monument]] and [[Pikes Peak State Park]] in [[Iowa]], sites of natural and manmade wonders.  Its rich history and location by the Mississippi River, make the city a popular destination for tourists. The Prairie Villa ''Rendezvous'', a gathering to recreate the atmosphere of a 19th-century fur trading camp, has been held annually in the city every [[Father's Day]] weekend since 1975, it attracts tens of thousands of visitors. 

In 2001, Prairie du Chien gained brief national attention for its first annual [[New Year's Eve]] celebration, during which a [[carp]] from the Mississippi River was dropped from a crane over BlackHawk Avenue at midnight. The &quot;Droppin' of the Carp&quot; celebration has been held every New Year's Eve since.

[[Hunting]] and [[fishing]] have long been popular in the area. The opening of [[Cabela's]] fourth outlet store in the city in 1998 firmly established the city as a destination for sportsmen.

==History==
[[Image:Bird's-Eye.View Sun Prairie ca.1875.jpg|thumb|left|A bird's eye view of Sun Prairie, circa 1875.]]
President [[Martin Van Buren]] commissioned a party of 45 men, including Augustus A. Bird, to build a capitol for the Territory of Wisconsin in [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]]. The group of men left [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]] on May 26, 1837, and traveled for days in the rain. On June 9, the group emerged at the edge of the prairie and with the sun shining for the first time in days, carved the words &quot;Sun Prairie&quot; into a tree. Charles Bird returned to the area two years later and became the first settler.&lt;ref name=&quot;OurCommunity&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Our Community: History |url=http://www.cityofsunprairie.com/docs/department_home.php?department_id=22&amp;main_id=1191 |publisher=City of Sun Prairie |work=www.cityofsunprairie.com |accessdate=2008-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dictionary of Wisconsin History |url=http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&amp;term_id=3739&amp;keyword=sun+prairie |publisher=Wisconsin Historical Society |work=www.wisconsinhistory.org |accessdate=2008-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Town of Sun Prairie was created on February 2, 1846.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dictionary of Wisconsin History |url=http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&amp;term_id=7608&amp;keyword=sun+prairie |publisher=Wisconsin Historical Society |work=www.wisconsinhistory.org |accessdate=2008-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city of Sun Prairie, which grew from that town, was [[Municipal corporation|incorporated]] in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sun Prairie, Wisconsin |url=http://www.city-data.com/city/Sun-Prairie-Wisconsin.html |publisher=City-Data.com |accessdate=2008-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geology===
The [[Yahara River|Yahara River Valley]] encompasses part of the city of Sun Prairie. This area contains deep glacial deposits created by the last [[Wisconsin Glaciation]]. The eastern part of Dane County, known as the [[drumlin]] and marsh physiographic area, includes most of Sun Prairie. The deposits found in this area include general glacial deposits and marsh deposits, and consist of many small drumlins interspersed with shallow glacial deposits having poorly defined drainage.

The general [[Soil classification|soils associations]] in the Sun Prairie area include the Dodge-St. Charles-McHenry, Plano-Ringwood-Griswold, and Batavia-Houghton-Dresden Associations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tn.bristol.wi.gov/county/app/docs/bristol/200508151607147271620.doc;sesessionid=9NZKT4RFCgf9NXJQR99GM5Jb |title=Comprehensive Plan &amp;ndash; 2003-2022: Agricultural, Natural and Cultural Resources Element

This association has a varied landscape, which is mostly sloping to sloping with some areas on [[Bench (geology)|benches]] and in [[Depression (geology)|depressions]]. The Dodge, St. Charles and McHenry soils are gently sloping to mostly sloping and well drained to moderately well drained. The Sable soils in this association are nearly level and poorly drained. Most of the soils in this association have moderate permeability and a high available water capacity. Most also have slight to moderate limitations for urban uses and farming.&lt;ref name=&quot;MasterPlan2020&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cityofsunprairie.com/admin/images/1bbd652031.pdf |title=City of Sun Prairie Master Plan 2020 |accessdate=2008-07-24 |work=www.cityofsunprairie.com |publisher=City of Sun Prairie |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cityscape===
[[Image:Main.St Sun Prairie ca.1900.jpg|thumb|left|Sun Prairie's Main Street, circa 1875.]] The landscape of the city consists mostly of gently rolling hills and [[plain]]s.

Sun Prairie has in recent years developed a number of [[Traditional Neighborhood Development (TND)|traditional neighborhood developments (TND)]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TND&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cityofsunprairie.com/docs/category.php?department_id=13&amp;category_id=1419 |title=Traditional Neighborhood Development in Sun Prairie (TND) |accessdate=2008-07-24 |work=www.cityofsunprairie.com |publisher=City of Sun Prairie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often referred to as &quot;[[new urbanism]]&quot;, these neighborhoods focus on the pedestrian and the appearance of city streets. While these developments have sought to address the problems and concerns associated with conventional [[suburb]]an development and [[urban sprawl]], many occupy former farmland and undeveloped rural lands. The city's planners addressed the criticisms that they were &quot;attempting to recreate &quot;pretend&quot; neighborhoods&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;TND&quot;/&gt; by noting that the aim of the TND was to borrow those design ideas and features effective in older neighborhoods and adapting them to current needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cityofsunprairie.com/admin/images/a719d34414.pdf |title=TND Design Principles |accessdate=2008-07-24 |work=www.cityofsunprairie.com |publisher=City of Sun Prairie |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flooding===
[[Image:Wisconsin Rain 5 June to 13 June 2008.png|thumb|right|NWS map of Wisconsin rainfall totals for 5 June 2008 to 13 June 2008.]]
 	
The city of Sun Prairie encounters occasional flooding because of the presence of [[hydric soil]]s, [[Surface runoff|spring melting]] and its proximity to the Koshkonong Creek. This condition is compounded by storm water runoff from development and urbanization in the upper reaches of the watershed. Many residents of the city believe that the problems with flooding are worsening, becoming more frequent over the last 14 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://danedocs.countyofdane.com/webdocs/PDF/ems/mitigation_plan/Attachment%2011%20Sun%20Prairie%20Town.pdf |title=Dane County Natural Hazard Mitigation Plan: Attachment 11: Town of Sun Prairie |accessdate= |author= |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= September 30, 2004 |format=pdf |work= |publisher=Dane County |pages=8 |language= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A flood on April 11, 2008, caused by heavy overnight rains that outpaced the city's storm drain system and leaked into the sewer system, resulted in flooding in residential basements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Zac |last=Schultz |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=WEATHER ALERT: Sun Prairie Flooding |url=http://www.nbc15.com/sunprairie/headlines/17561464.html |work=NBC15.com |publisher=NBC15 |date=2008-04-11 |accessdate=2008-07-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The city suffered considerably from the [[June 2008 Midwest floods]].

==Public services==

===Emergency services===
The city of Sun Prairie maintains its own [[emergency medical services|emergency medical service]], which is a charter member of Dane County's Mutual Aid Box Alarm System (MABAS). Responding to over 2,000 calls in 2007, the department addresses medical and rescue calls in the City of Sun Prairie and the Town of Bristol in a district covering {{convert|50|sqmi|km2}} with a population of nearly 30,000.

The  EMS was founded in October 1977 as an extension of the local police department. The city's rapid growth affected ambulance response times negatively, and the 1980s saw the hiring of a full-time EMS director.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityofsunprairie.com/docs/sub.php?department_id=9&amp;category_id=2913&amp;sub_id=2602 City of Sun Prairie - 1980's&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s and 1990s, most of the service was slowly replaced by full-time [[Emergency medical technician|EMTs]]. In the 1990s, the service made a transition from [[Emergency medical technician-basic|EMT-basic]] personnel to that of [[EMT-I/99#Higher_Levels_of_EMTs|intravenous technician]] levels and paramedic level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityofsunprairie.com/docs/sub.php?department_id=9&amp;category_id=2913&amp;sub_id=2601 City of Sun Prairie - 2000's&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sun Prairie EMS transports to all Madison hospitals and to Columbus Community Hospital in [[Columbus, Wisconsin|Columbus]]. In 2009 St. Mary's Hospital of Madison opened a free-standing [[emergency room]] facility in Sun Prairie.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbc15.com/sunprairie/headlines/9074791.html Emergency Care for Sun Prairie Closer to Home&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Utilities===
The city owns it own utilities, the Water &amp; Light Commission and the Water Pollution Control Facility. Sun Prairie's water is supplied from six wells pumped into the system or stored in the three water towers (Bird St, Columbus St, and Linnerud Dr), which maintain a storage capacity of {{convert|2.85|e6USgal|m3}}. The bulk of the city's electricity is purchased or generated by Sun Prairie Water &amp; Light, a Wisconsin Public Power, Inc (WPPI) member utility.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7&gt;[http://www.spwl.net/utility_issues/frontpagenews.asp?ID=863 Sun Prairie Water &amp; Light&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Natural gas is supplied to the city by WE-Energies with headquarters in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

===Telecommunications===
Telephone and Internet services are provided by Frontier Communications

==Economy==
[[QBE Insurance]] has American operations in Sun Prairie. Other significant employers include the Sun Prairie School District, [[American Family Insurance]] and [[Frontier Communications]].

Sun Prairie, and by proxy, Dane County, has a low unemployment rate, and in some instances the lowest of any metropolitan area in the nation.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.cityofsunprairie.com/admin/images/1bbd652031.pdf June 4, 1999&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The trend represented by this and other economic factors indicates &quot;an increase in the level of business activity and a slowdown in labor force growth, which is expected to last well into the 21st Century.&quot;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==Education==
The [[Sun Prairie Area School District]] administers local public education. The system, which as of the 2007-08 school year enrolled 6,024 students,
consists of seven [[elementary school]]s, two middle schools, an upper-middle school and a single high school.&lt;ref name=autogenerated9&gt;[http://www.cityofsunprairie.com/docs/department_home.php?department_id=22&amp;main_id=1191 City of Sun Prairie - Our Community Home&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three [[parochial school]]s in Sun Prairie. Founded in 1892, Sacred Hearts School is a [[Catholic school]] serving children of [[Pre-kindergarten|pre-K]] through [[Eighth grade|8th]] grade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacredhearts.k12.wi.us/ Sacred Hearts School&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Two other schools, Peace Evangelical Lutheran (pre-K-8) and Calvary Baptist Christian (K-8) have smaller student bodies. Most recently, Calvary Baptist, which had a very small enrollment of only 25 students, closed the school, effective June 30, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbcssp.org/ Calvary Baptist Christian School&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

*{{Jct|state=IL|I|94}} as it occurs [[Interstate 94 in Wisconsin|in Wisconsin]] runs east-west through the western, central and southeastern portions of the state. The junction of I-90 and i-94 occurs roughly six miles to the southwest of Sun Prairie heading eastward toward Milwaukee at what is commonly known as the &quot;Badger Interchange&quot; where the three interstates (I-39, I-90 and I-94) meet at the eastern terminus of [[Wisconsin Highway 30|WIS 30]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gov.state.ak.us/omb/02_OMB/Budget/Trans/proj34537.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. highways===
*[[Image:US 151.svg|20px]] [[U.S. Route 151]] (normally called '''U.S. Highway 151''', '''Highway 151''' or '''US 151''') runs northeast-southwest across the eastern to southwest portions of the state. Sun Prairie is divided lengthwise by 151, southwest to northeast, having four different access points: Windsor Street, Reiner Road, Main Street and Bristol Street

===Wisconsin state trunklines===
*[[Image:WIS 19.svg|20px]] [[Wisconsin Highway 19]] (often called '''Highway 19''', '''STH 19''' or '''WIS 19''') is a [[state highway (US)|state highway]] which passes around the north side of [[Madison (WI)|Madison]] and crosses US 151 as it passes through Sun Prairie. It serves as a local [[Connector (road)|connector route]] that links via various [[Interchange (road)|interchanges]] the communities of Sun Prairie, [[Watertown, Wisconsin|Watertown]] and [[Waunakee, Wisconsin|Waunakee]]. The highway follows two lane surface road for the entire length with the exception of [[urban area|urban]] multilane [[Arterial road|arterials]].

Prior to 1947, WIS 19 followed the current route of [[U.S. Route 18 in Wisconsin|US 18]] between [[Bridgeport, Wisconsin|Bridgeport]] and Madison. The route then passed through downtown Madison and followed then [[Wisconsin Highway 31|WIS 31]] (part of the current [[U.S. Route 151 in Wisconsin|US 151]]) to Sun Prairie. East of Sun Prairie the route followed its present day alignment to Watertown. The route then followed present-day WIS 16 to [[Waukesha, Wisconsin|Waukesha]] and east from there along present-day [[Wisconsin Highway 59|WIS 59]] into [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]].&lt;ref name=&quot;1926n&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broermapsonline.org/members/NorthAmerica/UnitedStates/Midwest/Wisconsin/unitedstates1926ra_036.html | title=Rand McNally Auto Road Atlas|year=1926|publisher=[[Rand McNally]]|accessdate=2008-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When the [[Numbered highways in the United States|U.S. Highway system]] was implemented, WIS 19's western terminus was relocated to Madison. The portion between Madison and Sun Prairie remained despite the debut of US 151 as did the eastern portion that became concurrent with  [[U.S. Route 16 in Wisconsin|US 16]]. In 1947, the eastern terminus was moved to Watertown, the section along US 151 was removed, and the portion between Mazomanie and Sun Prairie was implemented.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wisconsinhighways.org/listings/WiscHwys10-19.html#STH-019]&lt;/ref&gt;

The part of WIS 19 roughly from those interstates west to WIS 113 had at one time been on the corridor of a planned beltline route around the north side of Madison. The current status of the parkway is uncertain.&lt;ref name=&quot;WH2&quot;&gt;[http://www.co.dane.wi.us/execcommittees/northmendota/index.htm North Mendota Parkway Advisory Committee] accessed 13 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===County highways===
Sun Prairie is bordered by the following county roads:
* ''C'' (also named N. Grand Avenue) runs north-south and borders Sun Prairie to the west and is crossed by interchange by US 151.
* ''N'' (also named N. Bristol Street) runs north-south and bisects a third of the city to the west and is crossed by interchange by US 151.
* ''VV'' (also named Twin Lane Road) runs north-south and borders the city to the west and is crossed by interchange by US 151.
* Vinburn Road, which borders the city to the north, runs west toward [[DeForest, Wisconsin|DeForest]] and east toward Columbus.

===Bus service===
Sun Prairie has no bus service outside of the [[school bus]]es that serve area schools, but instead has provided a Shared Ride Taxi service&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityofsunprairie.com/docs/category.php?category_id=3111&amp;department_id=22 City of Sun Prairie - Taxi Service&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; for the past decade, whereby residents can travel throughout the city for a small charge, sometimes [[Share taxi|sharing]] the ride with other passengers. This service is subsidized by grants obtained by the city, which also provide for [[low income]] transit via the use of [[identification card]]s. [[Taxicab stand|Corner service]] is also available at specific street locations during the academic school year, and is intended primarily for middle-school and high school students. While the taxi service is exclusively for the city, Shared Taxi also provides for thrice-daily shuttle service (8:30 am, 12:30pm, 4:30pm) to nearby [[East Towne Mall]], on the northeastern edge of Madison, thus allowing commuters to use the [[Madison Metro]] bus system to travel within Madison.

===Airports===
{{Main|Dane County Regional Airport}}
[[Dane County Regional Airport]] {{airport codes|MSN|KMSN|MSN}}, also known as ''MSN Truax Field'', is a commercial [[airport]] located {{convert|10|mi|km}} southwest of Sun Prairie.&lt;ref name=autogenerated9 /&gt; Dane County Regional Airport has three [[runway]]s and in 2006 served over 1.6 million passengers.&lt;ref name=FAA&gt;{{FAA-airport|ID=MSN|use=PU|own=PU|site=27346.*A}}, effective 2007-12-20&lt;/ref&gt; Airlines serving the airport include [[AmericanConnection]], [[American Eagle Airlines|American Eagle]], [[Delta Air Lines|Delta]], [[Delta Connection]], [[Frontier Airlines]], [[United Airlines|United]], and [[United Express]].

===Railroads===
Although Sun Prairie has tracks for freight trains to the south of the city, the only passenger train to serve the area (including Madison) is [[Amtrak|Amtrak's]] ''[[Empire Builder]]'', which operates in the [[Midwest]]ern and [[The West (U.S.)|Northwest]]ern [[United States]]. The route runs from [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] to the [[Northwestern United States|Pacific Northwest]], arriving in nearby [[Columbus (Amtrak station)|Columbus (CBS)]]. The ridership on the train has increased slowly, averaging 16,850 per year traveling to and from Columbus,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.amtrak.com/pdf/factsheets/WISCONSIN07.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; despite the population growth in Sun Prairie. Travel time to and from Chicago is slightly under three hours.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amtrak.com/timetable/apr07/P07.pdf New Title&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marshfield''' is a city in [[Marathon County, Wisconsin|Marathon]] and [[Wood County, Wisconsin|Wood]] counties in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Wisconsin]]. It is located at the intersection of [[U.S. Highway 10]], [[Highway 13 (Wisconsin)|Highway 13]] and [[Highway 97 (Wisconsin)|Highway 97]]. The largest city in Wood County, its population was 19,118 at the 2010 census.&lt;ref name=&quot;Census 2010&quot;&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://factfinder2.census.gov| title=Profile of General Population and Housing Characteristics: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (DP-1): Marshfield city, Wisconsin| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau, American Factfinder| accessdate=September 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of this, 18,218 were in Wood County, and 900 were in Marathon County. The city forms one of the core areas of the [[United States Census Bureau]]'s Marshfield-Wisconsin Rapids [[Micropolitan Statistical Area]], which includes all of Wood County (2010 population: 74,749). The portion of the city that extends into Marathon County is part of the [[Wausau, Wisconsin|Wausau]] [[Metropolitan Statistical Area]].

==History==
In 1851 and 1853, when the area was still forested, [[Surveying|surveyors]] working for the U.S. government marked all the [[Section (United States land surveying)|section corners]] in the {{convert|6|by|6|mi}} square which now includes Marshfield, [[Hewitt, Wood County, Wisconsin|Hewitt]], and [[Cameron, Wood County, Wisconsin|Cameron]], working on foot with [[compass]] and [[Gunter's chain|chain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Land Survey Information| url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/SurveyNotes/SurveyInfo.html| publisher=Board of Commissioners of Public Lands| accessdate=18 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Field Notes for T25N R3E| url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/SurveyNotes/SurveyNotes-idx?type=PLSS&amp;town=T025N&amp;range=R003E| work=Original Field Notes and Plat Maps, 1833-1866| publisher=Board of Commissioners of Public Lands| accessdate=18 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;   When done, the deputy surveyor filed this general description:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''This [[Survey township|Township]] is nearly all Dry land, There being no Swamp of consequence in it. There being to much clay &amp; rocks in it. Particularly that part which contains [[Fir]] &amp; [[Tsuga canadensis|Hemlock]]. The surface is rough &amp; uneven(?) and rather to flat for anything but meadow. There is some good [[Eastern White Pine|Pine]] it but to much scattering to make it an object. The Township is well watered with small streams but none of them are of sufficient size for [[Watermill|Milling]] purposses. The streams are lined with [[Alder]] &amp; many of them producing good [[hay]]. There are no improvements in this Township.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Wright| first=O.

Marshfield was settled much later than many surrounding towns.

In 1872 the [[Wisconsin Central Railway (1897–1954)|Wisconsin Central Railway]] was building the leg of its line from [[Stevens Point, Wisconsin|Stevens Point]] through the forest to what would become [[Colby, Wisconsin|Colby]], heading north for [[Lake Superior]]. The railway needed a supply depot between those two towns, and Marshfield was about midway. At the railroad's request, Louis Rivers, his wife and child, and his brother Frank came to the area and started cutting an opening in the forest. They built a two-room log hotel at what is now the corner of Depot and Chestnut streets, with bunks in the west room and tables, benches, bar and store in the east room. That crude building between the stumps was the first permanent structure in Marshfield.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kleiman&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:Frank R Upham House.jpg|thumb|180px|left|The Frank R. Upham house was built in 1882.]]
The first industry was a [[barrel|stave]] and [[spoke]] factory located near the railroad.&lt;ref name=Jones&gt;{{cite book| last=Jones| first=George O.| title=History of Wood County Wisconsin| year=1923| publisher=H. C. Cooper Jr. &amp; Co.| location=Minneapolis - Winona| pages=180| url=http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/wch&amp;CISOPTR=39243&amp;REC=2| coauthors=Norman S. McVean and others}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1878 [[William H. Upham]], later governor of Wisconsin, built a [[sawmill]] near the railway, with a [[millpond]]. By 1885 he had added a [[general store]], a [[planing mill]], a furniture factory and a flour and feed mill. Other businesses started, too: an alcohol factory, hotels, saloons, stores, newspapers, [[blacksmith]], and a [[Hat|milliner]].  There were also churches and schools. The city was [[Municipal corporation|incorporated]] in 1883.  By 1885 the population exceeded 2,000, ranging from the Uphams in their fine [[Italianate architecture|Italianate]] homes to laborers living in shacks along the railroad.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kleiman&quot;/&gt;

In 1887 the young city was dealt a blow by fire. On June 27, after a dry three weeks, fire broke out among the drying piles in the Upham mill's lumberyard, ignited by a spark from a train. The fire spread, consuming the sawmill and flour mill, and headed south into homes and the business district. Men tried to stop the inferno, even dynamiting stores to create a fire break, but the updraft lifted embers and dropped them onto more buildings. When it was over, 250 buildings were destroyed, but no lives were lost. The next day, Upham announced he would rebuild his businesses. Neighbors in [[Stevens Point, Wisconsin|Stevens Point]], [[Spencer, Wisconsin|Spencer]] and [[Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin|Wisconsin Rapids]] sent trainloads of supplies. The city ruled that buildings on Central should henceforth be built from brick,&lt;ref name=&quot;Kleiman&quot;/&gt; even though Marshfield had been largely built on wealth generated by lumber.

The late 1800s saw a burst of railroad building. In 1872 the Wisconsin Central built the first line through town. In 1887 Upham Manufacturing started a line south from town to haul logs from [[Cameron, Wood County, Wisconsin|Cameron]] and [[Richfield, Wood County, Wisconsin|Richfield]]. In 1890 a line Neillsville was built. In 1891 a line was built from Centralia (now Wisconsin Rapids), another was built to [[Greenwood, Wisconsin|Greenwood]], and a third from [[Wausau, Wisconsin|Wausau]] to Marshfield came from the north. In 1901 a second line was built from Wisconsin Rapids to Marshfield. In 1903 38 passenger trains stopped daily in Marshfield.&lt;ref&gt;Kleiman, pp. 106–110.&lt;/ref&gt;  So many tracks intersected in the community that Marshfield was nicknamed &quot;Hub City&quot;.

[[Image:Roddis House Marshfield Wisconsin.jpg|thumb|180px|left|The Hamilton and Catherine Roddis House was built in 1914.]]
The hub was also agricultural.  Dairying began to organize as [[Cheesemaker|cheese factories]] started up, such as the one at [[Nasonville, Wisconsin|Nasonville]] in 1885.  Roddis and then Blum Brothers made wooden cheese boxes in Marshfield. By 1921 the Blum plant was making 3,500 boxes a day.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kleiman, p 25&quot;&gt;Kleiman, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1907 the first cold storage plant was built in town, to store local cheese before shipping it by rail to larger markets.&lt;ref&gt;Kleiman, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ice cream factories followed,&lt;ref&gt;Kleiman, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; and processing of eggs, chickens, and liquid milk. In 1923 a spokesman for the [[Soo Line Railroad]] said that Marshfield shipped more dairy products than any other city in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kleiman, p 25&quot;/&gt;

St. Joseph's hospital began with six beds in 1890. Operated by the [[Sisters of the Sorrowful Mother]], it offered early health insurance.  Lumbermen could pay a flat rate, and in exchange St. Joseph's would care for them in case of injury. In 1916, six local doctors formed a [[Group medical practice in the United States|group practice]] clinic in the second story of the Thiel building downtown, calling themselves [[Marshfield Clinic]].&lt;ref&gt;Kleiman, pp. 13-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[German American|German immigrants]] made up two thirds of Marshfield's population in the 1890s. One of the two early newspapers, ''Die Demokrat'', was published in German.&lt;ref&gt;Kleiman, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many had family back in [[Germany]] as [[World War I]] approached, and had mixed sympathies.&lt;ref&gt;Kleiman, pp. 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt;  In one of Marshfield's old Victorian houses, a once-hidden [[Wallpaper|paper]]-hanger's signature boasts, &quot;...1917, when the Germans licked the World.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Kleiman, p. 500.&lt;/ref&gt; Feelings were again mixed during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;Kleiman, pp. 60-61.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the summer of 1945, 243 German [[Prisoner of war|POWs]] were brought in to fill a labor shortage at the canning factory north of the current Wildwood Park.&lt;ref&gt;Kleiman, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wood-working and building continued long after the pines were cut.  During WWII Roddis Lumber and Veneer produced [[plywood]] and other composites and was &quot;the [[Allies of World War II|allies']] largest pre-fabricator of wood for [[liberty ship]]s.&quot;  Felker Brothers also produced components for the Liberty Ships.  The Frey brothers started building Rollohomes in 1947, and were followed by other manufacturers of [[mobile home|mobile]] and [[modular home|modular]] homes.&lt;ref&gt;Kleiman, pp. 70-71.&lt;/ref&gt;  With consolidation of [[Dairy farming|dairy]] and the [[late-2000s recession]], some of these industries have contracted, but the medical complex has expanded, now employing thousands. Roehl Transport has also become a large enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=City of Marshfield Economic Profile| url=http://ci.marshfield.wi.us/planning/handler.aspx?file_id=1018| publisher=City of Marshfield| accessdate=2012-02-18|year=2005?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 2011 three new plants opened on the east side of town to process sand for [[hydraulic fracturing]] of oil and gas wells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Welter| first=Liz| title=Frac sand mining begins in Marshfield amid mixed outlook| url=http://www.wausaudailyherald.com/article/20120114/CWS03/301140087/Frac-sand-mining-begins-Marshfield-amid-mixed-outlook| accessdate=2012-02-17| newspaper=Wausau Daily Herald| date=2012-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Racine''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|ei|s|i:|n|}} {{respell|RAY|seen}}, or {{IPAc-en|r|ə|'|s|i:|n|}} {{respell|ruh|SEEN|'}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.misspronouncer.com/cities/racine.html|title=Miss Pronouncer: How do you pronounce  Racine, Wisconsin?}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a city in and the [[county seat]] of [[Racine County, Wisconsin|Racine County]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States]]. It is located on the shore of [[Lake Michigan]] at the mouth of the [[Root River (Wisconsin)|Root River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://reference.allrefer.com/gazetteer/R/R00086-racine.html |title=Racine, Wisconsin (WI), United States |accessdate=2007-04-05 |work=AllRefer.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of the 2010 U.S. census, the city had a population of 78,860,&lt;ref name=&quot;uscb_quickfacts&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/55/5566000.html|title=Racine (city) QuickFacts|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=16 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the fifth-largest city in Wisconsin. Its median home price of $103,625&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.realestate.com/state/wi/ &quot;Wisconsin Homes For Sale By City&quot;.] RealEstate.com. Retrieved 13 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; makes it the least expensive city in Wisconsin to buy a home in.

Racine has long been a factory town with production of [[J. I. Case]] (heavy equipment), [[S. C. Johnson &amp; Son]] (cleaning and chemical products),  [[Dremel]] Corporation, [[Reliance Controls]] Corporation, [[Twin Disc]], and [[Arthur B. Modine]] (Heat Exchangers). It is home to various immigrant communities. Racine was home to wagon maker [[Mitchell &amp; Lewis Company]] in the 19th century. At the start of the 20th century the company began making motorcycles and automobiles as [[Mitchell-Lewis Motor Company]]. Racine was also home to the inventor of the [[InSinkErator]], the first garbage disposal. Architects of the city included [[A. Arthur Guilbert]] and [[Edmund Bailey Funston]]. [[Malted milk balls]] were also developed in Racine.

==History==
On October 10, 1699, a fleet of eight canoes bearing a party of French explorers entered the mouth of Root River. These were the first Europeans known to visit what is now Racine County. They established a trading post in the area that eventually became a small settlement on Lake Michigan near where the [[Root River (Wisconsin)|Root River]] empties into [[Lake Michigan]]. &quot;Racine&quot; is [[French language|French]] for &quot;root&quot;.

[[File:Root River Racine 070107.jpg|thumb|left|The mouth of the [[Root River (Wisconsin)|Root River]], Racine, Wisconsin]]
In 1832, just after the [[Blackhawk War]], the area surrounding Racine was settled by [[Yankee]]s from upstate [[New York]]. In 1834 Captain [[Gilbert Knapp]], [[United States Revenue Cutter Service|USRM]] founded the settlement of '''Port Gilbert''' at the place where the [[Root River (Wisconsin)|Root River]] empties into [[Lake Michigan]]. The area was previously called '''Kipi Kawi''' and '''Chippecotton''' by the indigenous peoples, both names for the Root River. The name &quot;Port Gilbert&quot; was never really accepted, and in 1841 the community was incorporated as the village of Racine. After Wisconsin was admitted to the Union in 1848, the new legislature voted in August to incorporate Racine as a city.

In 1852, [[Racine College]], an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] college, was founded; it closed in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/wmh/archives/search.aspx?area=browse&amp;volume=35&amp;articleID=19098 Wisconsinhistory.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1852, [[Racine High School]], the first public high school in Wisconsin, opened. The high school operated until 1926, when it was replaced by Park High School.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vindustries.com/racinehistory/features/racine-high-school/ Racine History]&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Racine was well known for its strong opposition to [[slavery]], with many slaves escaping to freedom via the [[Underground Railroad]] passing through the city. In 1854 [[Joshua Glover]], an escaped slave who had made a home in Racine, was arrested by [[United States Marshals Service|federal marshals]] and jailed in [[Milwaukee]]. One hundred men from Racine, and ultimately 5,000 Wisconsinites, rallied and broke into the jail to free him. He was helped to escape to [[Canada]]. Glover's rescue gave rise to many legal complications and a great deal of litigation. This eventually led to the [[Wisconsin Supreme Court]] declaring the [[Fugitive Slave Law of 1850]] unconstitutional, and later, the [[Wisconsin State Legislature]] refusing to recognize the authority of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]].

===Immigrant culture===
Waves of immigrants, including [[Danish people|Danes]], [[German people|Germans]], and [[Czech people|Czechs]], began to settle in Racine between the Civil War and the [[First World War]]. African Americans started arriving in large numbers during World War I, as they did in other [[Midwestern]] industrial towns, and [[Mexicans]] migrated to Racine from roughly 1925 onward.

[[Unitarianism|Unitarians]] from [[New England]] initially dominated Racine's religious life. Racine's Emmaus Lutheran Church, the oldest Danish Lutheran Church in North America, was founded on August 22, 1851. Originally a founding member of the Danish American Lutheran Church, it has subsequently been a member of the United Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (UDELCA), the [[American Lutheran Church]] (ALC), and, since 1988, the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]] (ELCA). There was also a large Catholic movement to the city, opening up churches for their own ethnicity, such as St. Stanislaus (Polish), St. Rose (Irish), Holy Name (German), St. Patrick (Irish), Sacred Heart (Italian), St. Joseph (German), St. Mary (German), Holy Trinity (Slovak), St. Casimir (Lithuanian), and others. As years passed, populations moved and St. Stanislaus, Holy Name, Holy Trinity, St. Rose, and St. Casimir merged in 1998, forming St. Richard. With new waves of people arriving, older parishes received a boost from the [[Hispanic]] community, which formed [[Cristo Rey Parish|Cristo Rey]], re-energizing St. Patrick's into the strong Catholic community of today.

[[File:Kringle.jpeg|thumb|Kringle from Racine, Wisconsin]]
Racine has the largest [[North America]]n settlement of Danes outside of [[Greenland]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} The city is particularly known for its Danish pastries, especially [[kringle]]. Several local bakeries have been featured on the [[Food Network]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/show_rd/episode/0,2857,FOOD_26716_45958,00.html |title=Road Tasted |accessdate=2007-04-05 |work=FoodNetwork.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/show_fi/episode/0,1976,FOOD_9962_18881,00.html |title=Food Finds |accessdate=2007-04-05 |work=FoodNetwork.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[O &amp; H Bakery]] and [[Bendtsen's Bakery]].

===Industry===
Racine was a factory town almost from the very beginning. The first industry in Racine County included the manufacture of fanning mills, machines that separate [[wheat]] grain from [[chaff]]. Racine also had its share of captains of industry, including [[Case Corporation|J. I. Case]] (heavy equipment), [[S. C. Johnson &amp; Son]] (cleaning and chemical products), and Arthur B. Modine (Heat Exchangers). Racine's harbor was central to the shipping industry in Wisconsin in the late 19th century. Racine was also an early [[car manufacturing]] center. One of the world's first [[automobile]]s was built there in 1871 or 1872 by Dr. J. W. Cathcart,&lt;ref&gt;Clymer, Floyd. ''Treasury of Early American Automobiles, 1877-1925'' (New York: Bonanza Books, 1950), p.2 &amp; 153.&lt;/ref&gt; as was the [[Pennington]]{{disambiguation needed|date=September 2012}} Victoria [[tricycle]],&lt;ref&gt;It had no less than two 4.75 hp (3.5 kW) engines. Clymer, p.6.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Mitchell Motor Car Company|Mitchell]],&lt;ref&gt;Before 1926. Clymer, p.36.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Case.&lt;ref&gt;Also before 1926. Clymer, p.153.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1887, [[malted milk]] was invented in Racine by English immigrant [[William Horlick]], and [[Horlicks]] remains a global brand. The [[garbage disposal]] was invented in 1927 by [[architect]] John Hammes of Racine, who founded the company [[InSinkErator]], which still produces millions of garbage disposers every year. Racine is also the home of [[S.C. Johnson &amp; Son]], whose [[Johnson Wax Headquarters|headquarters]] was designed in 1936 by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]. Wright also designed the Wingspread Conference Center and several homes and other buildings in Racine. The city is also home to the [[Dremel]] Corporation, Reliance Controls Corporation and  [[Twin Disc]].

===Historic districts and buildings===
Racine includes the [[Old Main Street Historic District (Racine, Wisconsin)]]. Historic buildings in Racine include the [[Badger Building]], [[Racine Elks Club, Lodge No. 252]], [[St. Patrick's Roman Catholic Church (Racine, Wisconsin)]], [[Young Men's Christian Association Building (Racine, Wisconsin)]], [[Chauncey Hall House]], [[Eli R. Cooley House]], [[George Murray House (Racine, Wisconsin)]], [[Hansen House (Racine, Wisconsin)]], [[Racine College]], [[McClurg Building (Racine, Wisconsin)]], [[First Presbyterian Church (Racine, Wisconsin)]], [[Memorial Hall (Racine, Wisconsin)]], [[Racine Depot]], [[United Laymen Bible Student Tabernacle]], [[Chauncey Hall Building]], [[Thomas P. Hardy House]], and [[Horlick Field]]. The area is home to several National Register of Historic Places listed structures: [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Wisconsin (section Racine County)]]. The city is also home to [[Regency Mall (Racine)]].

[[Frank Lloyd Wright]] designed and built the [[Johnson Wax Headquarters]] building in Racine. The building was and still is considered a marvel of design innovation, despite its many practical annoyances such as leaks. Wright urged then-president Hib Johnson to build the structure outside of Racine, a city Wright thought of as &quot;backwater.&quot; Johnson refused to have the Johnson Wax Headquarters sited anywhere other than Racine, and in a compromise Wright built it in Racine, but without windows.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

===Cultural notes===
The city is known for its large prom celebration, at which students from all the high schools in the city participate in an after prom party. This was featured on the radio show ''[[This American Life]]'' in Episode #186 &quot;Prom&quot;, which originally aired on June 8, 2001;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thislife.org/Radio_Episode.aspx?sched=875 |title=This American Life |accessdate=2008-05-28 |work=ThisLife.org }}&lt;/ref&gt; Racine's prom tradition was also the subject of the 2006 documentary ''[[The World's Best Prom]]''.

In recent years, Racine has experienced a decrease in population rate largely because of its being surrounded by neighboring suburbs, such as Mount Pleasant that have absorbed much of the population growth. As late as 1970, Racine was the third largest city in Wisconsin.

Racine received an award the [[United States Conference of Mayors|U.S. Conference of Mayors]] on June 20, 2011 for having the best tasting city water in America.

The ''[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]'' formerly published a Racine-specific page on Thursdays and a Racine County section on Sundays, but dropped those in a series of downsizings that began in 2007. ''The Insider News'' covers issues specific to the African-American community. ''Racinenews.org''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.racinenews.org Racinenews.org]&lt;/ref&gt; offers web-based coverage for Racine, as did news website ''Racinepost.com''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.racinepost.com Racinepost.com]&lt;/ref&gt; before they decided to shut down.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.racinepost.com/2010/11/patch-joins-online-local-local-news.html News.racinepost.com]&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2010, ''Wisconsin Internet News''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wisconsininternetnews.com Wisconsininternetnews.com]&lt;/ref&gt; was created, as another news source for the Racine/Kenosha area. The city has one television station owned by [[Weigel Broadcasting]], [[WMLW-TV]] (Channel 49), an [[Independent station (North America)|independent station]] which airs syndicated product, and had its analog transmitter just north of the Milwaukee County line in [[Oak Creek, Wisconsin|Oak Creek]]. For all intents and purposes the station serves all of southeastern Wisconsin, with the station offices located in [[West Allis, Wisconsin|West Allis]] and the station's current transmitter is located on the Weigel tower in Milwaukee's Lincoln Park. WMLW airs a Saturday morning [[public affairs (broadcasting)|public affairs]] program called ''Racine &amp; Me'', which is produced and hosted by CBS 58 Anchor Jessica Tighe and is devoted to topics of interest to Racine residents.

Radio stations serving the area are [[adult contemporary]] [[WEZY]]-FM (92.1) and [[urban contemporary]] [[WKKV]]-FM (100.7). WEZY specifically targets Racine and Kenosha and is locally-owned, while WKKV is a station owned by [[Clear Channel Communications]] that, although licensed to Racine and having a transmitter in north-central Racine County, is targeted towards Milwaukee audiences and has its offices in [[Greenfield, Wisconsin|Greenfield]].

The population of Watertown was 23,861 at the 2010 census.&lt;ref name=&quot;Census 2010&quot;&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://factfinder2.census.gov| title=Profile of General Population and Housing Characteristics: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (DP-1): Watertown city, Wisconsin| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau, American Factfinder| accessdate=October 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of this, 15,402 were in Jefferson County, and 8,459 were in Dodge County.

Watertown is the largest city in the Watertown-Fort Atkinson [[micropolitan area]], which also includes [[Johnson Creek, Wisconsin|Johnson Creek]] and [[Jefferson, Wisconsin|Jefferson]].

==History==

===Origin===
Watertown was first settled by Timothy Johnson, who built a cabin on the west side of the [[Rock River (Mississippi River)|Rock River]] in 1836.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.watertownhistory.org/Articles/TimothyJohnson.htm| title=The Johnsons Reunited: Family of city's first citizen arrives| date=January 22, 1851| work=Watertown Chronicle| accessdate=2009-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; A park on the west side of the city is named in his honor. The area was settled to utilize the power of the Rock River, which falls {{convert|20|ft|m}} in two miles (two {{convert|10|ft|m|sing=on}} dams).  In contrast, the Rock River falls only {{convert|34|ft|m}} in {{convert|58|mi|km}} upstream from Watertown.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnr.state.wi.us/org/gmu/uprock/ Upper Rock River Basin – WDNR]. Dnr.state.wi.us.&lt;/ref&gt; The water power was first used for [[sawmill]]s, and later prompted the construction of two [[hydroelectric]] dams, one downtown (where the river flows south) and one on the eastern edge of the city (where the river flows north).

===Milwaukee and Rock River Canal===
A [[canal]] from [[Milwaukee]] to the Watertown area was once planned, but was replaced by railroad before any work had been completed, other than a dam in Milwaukee.&lt;ref&gt;Geo. W. Peck. ''Wisconsin: comprising sketches of counties, towns, events, institutions, and persons, arranged in cyclopedic form'', Madison, Wis.: Western Historical Association, 1906.&lt;/ref&gt; The territorial legislature incorporated the Milwaukee and Rock River Canal company in 1836, but the plan was abandoned in 1848. The canal would have provided a waterway between the [[Great Lakes]] and the [[Mississippi River]], but even if completed, it may not have seen much success because railroads had already become the preferred mode of transportation.

===19th century growth===
In 1853, a [[plank road]] was completed from Milwaukee to Watertown.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.watertownhistory.org/ Watertown Historical Society]. Watertownhistory.org.&lt;/ref&gt;  After plank roads were no longer used, the route was replaced by highway ([[Wisconsin Highway 16]]) and a railroad. A street named &quot;Watertown Plank Road&quot; survives in Milwaukee. It is referred to in the &quot;Plank Road Brewery&quot; family of beers, produced by [[Miller Brewing Company]] in Milwaukee.

The city grew slowly at first, but an influx of [[Germans|German]] immigrants increased the population to over 10,000 in the late 19th century. The city is the home of the [[First Kindergarten|first kindergarten]] in the United States, started in 1856 by [[Margarethe Schurz]], wife of statesman [[Carl Schurz]]; the building that housed this kindergarten is now located on the grounds of the [[Octagon House (Watertown, Wisconsin)|Octagon House Museum]] in Watertown.

===City railroad bond default===
Growth of the city was substantially hampered when Watertown issued almost half a million dollars in [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] to support the building of two railroads to town to encourage further growth: the Chicago &amp; Fond du Lac Company and the Milwaukee, Watertown &amp; Madison Road.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.watertownhistory.org/Articles/CityGovernment101.htm City Government 101]. Watertownhistory.org.&lt;/ref&gt;  The success of the plank road convinced residents that a railroad would be even more beneficial, and bonds were issued from 1853 to 1855. The Milwaukee and Watertown Railroad, as it was called before it extended to [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]], was completed in 1855, only the second line in the state.&lt;ref&gt;M. Wyman. ''The Wisconsin Frontier.'' Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after, the two railroads went bankrupt in the [[Panic of 1857]]. The bonds were sold by the original investors to out-of-town speculators at a small fraction of their face value. Since the railroads were never built and did not produce revenue, the city was unable to pay off the bonds.  Moreover, the city did not feel compelled to do so because the creditors (those who held the bonds) were not only from out of town, but weren't even the original holders. Yet the creditors exerted so much pressure on the city to pay off the bonds that Watertown effectively dissolved its government so that there was no legal entity (the government as a whole or officers) that could be served a court order to pay or appear in court. The case was not resolved until 1889, when it had risen all the way to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], which essentially dismissed the case of the creditors. A small amount remained to be paid, and this was not paid off until 1905, half a century later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.watertownhistory.org/Articles/Railroad_Milwaukee_and_Watertown.htm Milwaukee and Watertown Railroad]. Watertown History.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography and climate==
Watertown is located in southeastern Wisconsin, approximately midway between [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]] and [[Milwaukee]], at 43°12'N 88°43'W (43.193, −88.724).{{GR|1|dateform=mdy}} According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|12.51|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which, {{convert|12.11|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.40|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.&lt;ref name =&quot;Gazetteer files&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small communities in the immediate area (e.g., within the school district) include Richwood, [[Lebanon, Dodge County, Wisconsin|Lebanon]], Old Lebanon, Sugar Island, Pipersville, [[Concord, Wisconsin|Concord]], Ebenezer, and Grellton.

The [[Rock River (Mississippi River)|Rock River]] flows through Watertown in a horseshoe bend before heading south and west on its way to the [[Mississippi River]]. The city originally developed inside the horseshoe, though it has long since grown beyond. Silver Creek adjoins the river in the city, as does a short creek on the west side.

The most notable geographical feature is a high density of [[drumlin]]s, long hills formed by the [[glacier]]s of the [[Wisconsin glaciation]] as they retreated northwards. Hills in the area are elongated in the north-south direction.

==History==
Oshkosh was named for [[Menominee]] [[Chief Oshkosh]], whose name meant &quot;claw&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.menominee.nsn.us/History/History/HistoryPages/HistoryLeadersChiefOshkosh.htm Chief Oshkosh]&lt;/ref&gt; (cf. [[Anishinaabe language|Ojibwe]] ''oshkanzh'', &quot;the claw&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freelang.net/dictionary/ojibwe.html |title=Ojibwe Dictionary |publisher=Freelang |accessdate=2007-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the [[fur trade]] brought the first European settlers to the area as early as 1818, it never became a major player in the fur trade. It was the establishment and growth of the [[lumber industry]] in the area that spurred development of Oshkosh. Oshkosh was incorporated as a city in 1853, although it had already been designated the [[county seat]], and had a population of nearly 2,800.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ci.oshkosh.wi.us/Landmarks_Commission/City_History.htm History of Oshkosh, Wisconsin]&lt;/ref&gt;

The lumber industry became well established as businessmen took advantage of navigable [[waterway]]s to provide access to both markets and northern pineries. The 1859 arrival of [[railroad|rail transportation]] expanded the ability to meet the demands of a rapidly-growing [[construction]] market. At one time, Oshkosh was known as the &quot;Sawdust Capital of the World&quot; due to the amount of lumber mills, 11 by 1860. By 1874, there were 47 sawmills and 15 shingle mills. By 1870, Oshkosh had become the third-largest city in [[Wisconsin]] with a population of over 12,000. The ''Oshkosh Daily Northwestern'' [[newspaper]] (now the [[Oshkosh Northwestern]]) was founded around this time, as was the Oshkosh State Normal School (now the [[University of Wisconsin Oshkosh]]). On April 28, 1875, Oshkosh had a &quot;Great Fire&quot; that consumed homes and businesses along Main Street north of the Fox River. The fire had engulfed 70 stores, 40 factories, and 500 homes costing nearly $2.5 million (or $51.2 million in 2010 money) in damage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ci.oshkosh.wi.us/fire/pdf/History.pdf The Great Oshkosh Fire of 1875]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B01E3DB1E39EF34BC4953DFB366838E669FDE The Great Fire, New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1900 Oshkosh was home of the [[Gambrinus Brewing Co.|Oshkosh Brewing Company]], which coined the [[marketing]] slogan &quot;By Gosh It's Good.&quot; Its Chief Oshkosh became a nationally distributed beer.

===Historic districts===
The city has a total of 33 listings on the [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Winnebago County, Wisconsin|National Register of Historic Places]]. The lumber industry made the fortunes of area entrepreneurs and businessmen, who made significant contributions to the community, [[politics]] and [[philanthropy|philanthropic organizations]]. Availability of materials and [[capital (economics)|capital]], along with devastating downtown fires in the mid-1870s, created a range of well-designed buildings for residential, commercial, civic and religious use. The many structures which make up the city's historic areas are largely a result of the capital and materials generated by the lumber and associated wood manufacturing industries. Oshkosh had six historic districts as of October 2011. They include the Algoma Boulevard, Irving/Church, North Main Street, [[University of Wisconsin–Oshkosh#Historic places|Oshkosh State Normal School]] on the University of Wisconsin–Oshkosh campus, Paine Lumber Company and Washington Avenue historic districts.

The city had 27 historic buildings as of October 2011. Eleven are houses, four are churches, and the remainder include schools, colleges, a bank, a fire house, an observatory, the county courthouse, and a cemetery where many of the entrepreneurs are buried.

Oshkosh also has an airport named Wittman Field or [[Wittman Regional Airport]] which opened in 1927 as Oshkosh Airport Inc. The airport had commercial traffic starting in 1928 when Northwest Airways delivered mail to Oshkosh and the Fox Cities. In 1972, the airport was renamed after race pilot Steve Wittman who was the airport manager for 38 years. Wittman Field did have commercial service on United Airlines and American Airlines until the mid-1980s. Today, Wittman Field is the home of the AirVenture Air Show and Expo (formerly the EAA up to 1998). The EAA started in 1953 in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]] at [[Timmerman Field]]. In 1959, the EAA was moved to [[Rockford, Illinois]]. By 1969, the EAA had grown too big for Rockford Municipal Airport. The convention voted on moving to Oshkosh. During the Air Show, Wittman becomes the busiest airport in the world with more than 500,000 people and 10,000 airplanes attending AirVenture each year.

Plastic packaging is also a major industry, with Bemis as a major employer. There are two well known [[chocolate]] companies located in Oshkosh, Hughes and Oaks.

Oshkosh is known for [[OshKosh B'Gosh]], a [[manufacturer]] of [[overall]]s and children's clothing founded in Oshkosh in 1895. Originally a small-town [[manufacturer]] of adult work clothing, it became best known for its children's lines. The original children's overalls, dating from the early twentieth century, were intended to help children dress like their fathers. According to the company, sales increased dramatically when Miles Kimball, an Oshkosh-based [[mail-order]] catalog, featured a pair of the overalls in its national catalog. As a result, OshKosh B'Gosh began to sell their products through [[department store]]s and expanded their children's line. Despite the name, OshKosh B'Gosh overalls are no longer made in Oshkosh, though the company maintains [[corporation|corporate]] offices there.

The population was 3,933 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. The city is located partially within the [[Chilton, Calumet County, Wisconsin|Town of Chilton]].

==History==
The first residents of Chilton were African-American Moses Stanton and his Native-American wife, Catherine, who arrived in January 1845.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wulff&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Wulff|first=Eugene C.|title=The New Holstein Story|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NHHS88&gt;{{cite book | title=Pioneer's Corner | author= Stories compiled and presented by the New Holstein Historical Society | page = 88 |accessdate = February 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city formed around his saw mill and a [[grist mill]] a few years later. The village was originally called Stantonville.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wulff&quot; /&gt; John Marygold bought the place in 1852 and called it &quot;Chilington,&quot; referring to his native town [[Chillington]] in England.&lt;ref name=NHHS88 /&gt; He sent a verbal message to have the name change recorded in [[Stockbridge, Wisconsin|Stockbridge]], then the county seat. Because the middle ''ing'' in the name was accidentally omitted, the municipality was recorded as Chilton.&lt;ref name=NHHS88 /&gt;

===Gravesville===
Chilton annexed the unincorporated community of Gravesville in the late twentieth century. Gravesville was founded 1849 by Leroy Graves and the community was named after him.&lt;ref name=&quot;ChiltonTimesJournalJan181973&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Edens|first=Mrs. Dale|title=Historical Insight|accessdate=January 12, 2013|newspaper=[[Chilton Times Journal]]|date=January 18, 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1881 it was one of the largest communities in the county behind Chilton and [[Stockbridge, Wisconsin|Stockbridge]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ChiltonTimesJournalJan181973&quot; /&gt; Gravesville had over 400 residents and it unsuccessfully vied for becoming the county seat.&lt;ref name=&quot;ChiltonTimesJournalJan181973&quot; /&gt; Graves built a sawmill in 1849 which remained in the community until he moved it to [[Fond du Lac, Wisconsin|Fond du Lac]] in 1886.&lt;ref name=&quot;ChiltonTimesJournalJan181973&quot; /&gt; At its peak, the community had several [[general store]]s, a furniture factory, and a saw/planing mill.&lt;ref name=&quot;ChiltonTimesJournalJan181973&quot; /&gt;

'''Middleton''' is a city in [[Dane County, Wisconsin|Dane County]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States]]. It is a north-western suburb of the state capital, [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]], but it was actually founded before Madison. It got its name from [[Middletown, Connecticut]]; the &quot;w&quot; being dropped was due to a paper work error made by long time historian Edward Kromrey (namesake of the local middle school). Middleton's motto is &quot;The Good Neighbor City.&quot; The population was 17,442 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].

In July 2007, ''CNN/Money'' and ''Money'' magazine considered Middleton the best place to live in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2007/moneymag/0707/gallery.BPTL_top_100.moneymag/index.html|title=Best Places to Live: Top 100|publisher=CNN Money.com|accessdate=2009-05-03 | first1=Kate | last1=Ashford | first2=Andrea | last2=Bartz | first3=Jeff | last3=Cox | first4=Asa | last4=Fitch | first5=Stephen | last5=Gandel | first6=Josh | last6=Hyatt | first7=Rob | last7=Kelley | first8=Kathleen | last8=Knight | first9=Joe | last9=Light}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2009, ''CNN/Money'' and ''Money'' magazine ranked Middleton the fourth best place to live in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/moneymag/bplive/2009/|title= Best Places to Live: Money's list of America's best small towns|date=July 2009|publisher=[[CNN]] Money|accessdate=2009-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name is French for ''bottom (or foot) of the lake'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&amp;term_id=161&amp;search_term=fond+du+lac |title=Dictionary of Wisconsin History |publisher= Wisconsin Historical Society| accessdate=2008-10-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uwgb.edu/wisfrench/study/research/fondlac.htm |title=Fond du Lac: Links to our Past |accessdate=2007-03-20 |author=Clorissa Swingen |date=Spring 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; so named because of its location at the bottom (south end) of [[Lake Winnebago]]. The population was 43,021 at the 2010 census. 

The city forms the core of the [[United States Census Bureau]]'s Fond du Lac [[United States metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]], which includes all of Fond du Lac County (2000 population: 97,296). Fond du Lac is the 342nd largest [[Metropolitan Statistical Area]] (MSA) in the United States.

==History==
Native American tribes, primarily the [[Winnebagos]] but inclusive of the [[Potawatomi]], [[Kickapoo people|Kickapoo]], and [[Mascoutin]] lived or gathered in the area long before European explorers arrived. Although it is not known for certain who was the first white man to explore the southern end of [[Lake Winnebago]], it was probably [[Claude-Jean Allouez]], followed by French fur trappers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mentzer|first=Michael|title=Fond du Lac County:  Gift of the Glacier|year=199|publisher=Fond du Lac County Historical Society|location=Fond du Lac, WI USA|isbn=0-9631213-0-8|pages=212}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[James Duane Doty|James Doty]], a federal judge for the western part of the [[Michigan Territory]], thought that the land at the foot of Lake Winnebago might someday be a great city. Consequently, he and his partners bought land in the area. In 1836, during the Wisconsin Territorial Legislature, John Arndt proposed making Fond du Lac the new capital. The motion failed, and Doty convinced the legislature to choose [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]] instead.  

Colwert and Fanna Pier were the first white residents of the area. In 1835, the construction of the [[Military Ridge Road]] began, which passed through Fond du Lac, connecting the forts in Wisconsin and [[Fort Dearborn]] in Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/archstories/early_roads/military_roads.asp&lt;/ref&gt; The first school in Fond du Lac was built in 1843. The first railroad came to Fond du Lac in 1852.  Around this time, in 1856, the first English newspaper in Fond du Lac, the Fond du Lac Commonwealth was founded. Logging and milling were primary industries in the late 1880s, with access to the lake as the engine of the industry.

'''Manitowoc''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|æ|n|ɨ|t|ə|w|ɒ|k}} is a city in and the [[county seat]] of [[Manitowoc County, Wisconsin|Manitowoc County]], Wisconsin, United States.{{GR|6}} The city is located on [[Lake Michigan]] at the mouth of the [[Manitowoc River]]. According to the 2010 [[census]], Manitowoc had a population of 33,736, with over 50,000 residents in the surrounding communities. The city participates in international [[town twinning]] with the [[Japan]]ese city of [[Kamogawa, Chiba|Kamogawa]].

==History==
Purported to mean ''dwelling of the great spirit'', Manitowoc derived its name from either the [[Anishinaabe language]] word ''manidoowaak(wag)'', meaning spirit-spawn(s), or ''manidoowaak(oog)'', meaning spirit-wood(s).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&amp;term_id=3431&amp;search_term=manitowoc &quot;Manitowoc&quot;] in ''Dictionary of Wisconsin History''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1838, an act of the Territorial Legislature separated [[Manitowoc County]] from [[Brown County, Wisconsin|Brown County]], keeping the native name for the region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.2manitowoc.com/RPlumb02.html &quot;Chapter II: The Indians&quot;], ''A History of Manitowoc County'', Ralph G. Plumb, 1904.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=city&gt;[http://www.manitowoc.org/facts_history.html &quot;History&quot;], ''City of Manitowoc'' site. Retrieved 29 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1820, Matthew Stanley and his wife were the first to settle in the area. {{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}. In 1835, President [[Andrew Jackson]] authorized land sales for the region, drawing the interest of land speculators. William Jones and Louis Fizette were the two first recorded buyers on August 3, 1835, with the majority of the land being procured by the Chicago firm Jones, King, &amp; Co. Benjamin Jones, brother of William, took the Wisconsin property as his share and is considered the founder of Manitowoc. Early immigrant groups included Germans, Norwegians, British, Irish, and Canadians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.2manitowoc.com/RPlumb03.html &quot;Chapter III: Early Settlement&quot;], ''A History of Manitowoc County'', Ralph G. Plumb, 1904.&lt;/ref&gt; The first school in Manitowoc was held in the Jones warehouse, with S. M. Peake instructing the twelve children of the community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.2manitowoc.com/RPlumb13.html &quot;Chapter XIII: Education&quot;], ''A History of Manitowoc County'', Ralph G. Plumb, 1904.&lt;/ref&gt; The first religious organization in the county, [[St. James' Episcopal Church, Manitowoc|St. James' Episcopal Church]], first met in 1841.&lt;ref name=plumb&gt;[http://www.2manitowoc.com/episch.html &quot;Episcopal and Methodist Episcopal Churches&quot;], ''A History of Manitowoc County'', Ralph G. Plumb, 1904.&lt;/ref&gt; Manitowoc was chartered as a village on March 6, 1851&lt;ref name=city/&gt; and on March 12, 1870 was incorporated as a city.&lt;ref name=city/&gt;

In 1847, Joseph Edwards built the first [[schooner]] in the area, the ''Citizen'', a modest precursor to the [[shipyard|shipbuilding industry]] that produced schooners and clippers used for fishing and trading in the [[Great Lakes]] and beyond the [[St. Lawrence River]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.2manitowoc.com/RPlumb06.html &quot;Chapter VI: Marine&quot;], ''A History of Manitowoc County'', Ralph G. Plumb, 1904.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[landing craft]], [[Tanker (ship)|tankers]] and [[submarine]]s became the local contributions to U.S. efforts in [[World War II]].

[[File:SputnikSiteManitowocWI.jpg|thumb|left|Disk marks location of the [[Sputnik 4]] impact]]
On September 5, 1962, a {{convert|20|lb|kg|adj=on}} piece of the seven-ton [[Sputnik 4]] crashed on North 8th Street. Sputnik 4 was a [[Soviet Union|USSR]] satellite, part of the [[Sputnik program]] and a test-flight of the [[Vostok spacecraft]] that would be used for the first [[human spaceflight]]. It was launched on May 15, 1960. A bug in the guidance system had pointed the capsule in the wrong direction, so instead of dropping into the atmosphere the satellite moved into a higher orbit. It re-entered the atmosphere on or about September 5, 1962.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roadsideamerica.com/story/12959 Sputnik Crashed Here, Manitowoc, Wisconsin&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HeraldTimesReports09072008&gt;{{cite news|url=http://m.htrnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080907/MAN0101/809070447/1358/MANnews|title=Having a blast with the past at festival|last=Mathews|first=Charlie|date=September 7, 2008|publisher=[[Herald Times Reporter]]|accessdate=2008-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; A cast was made from the original piece before the Soviets claimed it, and the cast was displayed at the [[Rahr West Art Museum]].&lt;ref name=RoadsideAmerica&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roadsideamerica.com/story/12959|title=Sputnik Crashed Here|publisher=Roadside America|accessdate=2008-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; A customer in a nearby art gallery jokingly suggested that the city should hold a festival to celebrate the crash.&lt;ref name=HeraldTimesReports09072008/&gt; The city held the first Sputnikfest in 2008, which was organized by the head of both museums.&lt;ref name=HeraldTimesReports09072008/&gt;

Manitowoc is home to the [[Wisconsin Maritime Museum]], and is one endpoint of the ferry route of the [[SS Badger|SS ''Badger'']], which connects [[U.S. Route 10]] to [[Ludington, Michigan]].

Since the late 1990s, several new shopping centers have opened in the city, mostly on the southwest side of the city along [[Interstate 43]], including the new [[Harbor Town Center]] shopping complex. The downtown area has also seen a resurgence, with several new restaurants opening, and the recent announcement of new $100,000+ condominiums on the Manitowoc River, along with a completion of the riverwalk trail. The bulk of the redevelopment in the city has been undertaken by the public/private partnership the [[Manitowoc County Economic Development Corporation]].

President Obama visited Manitowoc on January 26, 2011, the day after his first State of the Union speech. He spoke to workers at [[Orion Energy Systems, Inc.|Orion Energy]], a manufacturer of solar technology, and praised Manitowoc for reinventing itself after the departure of [[Mirro Aluminum Company]] in 2003.

[[Comcast]] holds the city's cable franchise, inherited from the company's earlier purchase of [[Jones Intercable]], and the city has the only presence of Comcast in all of Eastern Wisconsin.

== History ==
[[Image:Wisconsin in 1718.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Wisconsin in 1718, [[Guillaume de L'Isle]] map, showing the historic portage.]]
The [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes that once lived here, and later the [[Europe]]an traders and settlers, took advantage of the lowlands between the Fox and Wisconsin Rivers as a natural &quot;[[portage]]&quot;. The [[France|French]] fur traders described the place as &quot;le portage&quot;, which eventually lent itself to the name of the community. As a portage, this community developed as a center of commerce and trade; later, a [[canal]] was constructed to facilitate this trade.  When the railroads came through, the community continued in this role.

Portage emerged at this place because of its unique position along the one and a half mile strip of marshy floodplain between the Fox and Wisconsin Rivers. By the end of the 17th century, the Fox-Wisconsin waterway, linked at The Portage, served as the major fur trade thoroughfare between [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]] and [[Prairie du Chien]]. It was not until the 1780s and 1790s that traders built their posts and warehouses at each end of The Portage.  In the early 19th century Portage was primarily populated by [[Metis (UnIted States}Metis]].&lt;ref&gt;Jaqueline Peterson and Jennifer S. H. Brown, ''The New Peoples'', p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1828, the federal government recognized the strategic economic importance of The Portage and built [[Fort Winnebago]] at the Fox River end. After 15 years of controversy, Winnebago settlement (now Portage) won the [[county seat]] in 1851.  The community incorporated as Portage City in 1854.

The Portage business district lies along a hill that overlooks the [[Portage Canal]]. The buildings now in the city's downtown were once part of a bustling, urban commercial center serving a large region across north central Wisconsin. The building of the city paralleled its commercial prominence between the end of the [[American Civil War]] and the second decade of the 20th century.
{{-}}

== Cityscape ==
When Portage was first established, the streets were laid out on a traditional [[grid system]]. Today, the streets of the outlying city are contorted as a result of the many marshes and lowlands that run through much of Columbia County. The northern side of the city thus looks different than the central city, with the organized grid street system giving way to a more suburban streetscape with a lower housing density.

The city has two commercial areas. One is the [[downtown]] historic district, which features several small boutique shops and restaurants; the other is the Northridge commercial area that features [[big box]] stores. In the summer of 2007, the [[Portage Canal]] was cleaned up and now features a [[bike path]] that runs alongside part of it. In the summer of 2008, the main downtown street was redone. Historical landmarks of the city include the Museum at the Portage, the [[Indian Agency house]], and the [[Surgeons Quarters]].

'''Omro''' is a city in [[Winnebago County, Wisconsin|Winnebago County]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States]]. The population was 3,517 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. The city is located along the [[Fox River (Wisconsin)|Fox River]], approximately 10 miles west of Oshkosh, Wisconsin.

==History==

===1853 description===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
OMRO, P. V., on section 17 and 18, in town of Bloomingdale, Winnebago county, at the junction of the Manitowoc and Menasha, (extended), and the Waupun and Liberty Prairie plank roads. It is pleasantly situated on the south side of the Neenah [Fox] river, 11 miles west from Oshkosh, and 75 miles northeast from Madison. It has a heavy body of timber on the north, with a rich soil of openings and prairie on the south, and has excellent facilities by water for obtaining pine logs from the immense pinery of Wolf river, a great quantity of which is here manufactured into lumber. Population 600, with 100 dwellings, 5 stores, 2 hotels, 3 mills, and 4 religious denominations. A Company has been organized and is now completing the proper buildings for the manufacture of glass.&lt;ref&gt;John W. Hunt,''Wisconsin Gazetteer''. Madison, Wisconsin: 1853.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===History of Omro===
Present day Omro used to be Winnebago Indian Territory when it was first visited by French explorers in 1639. Charles Omereau, the French trader and blacksmith who gave his name to the future city, started a fur trading post there. Omro's location gave it two advantages from the beginning, which were a position on one of the few natural transportation and communications routes of the time and an abundant amount of water for industrial use. The first modern settlers visited in 1847. By 1880, Omro was very popular. It was a stop on the railroad line and was home to the county fairgrounds, several mills, a glass factory, carriage factories, several machine works, and had more than 2,000 people settled there. Most of the manufacturing centers either relocated to nearby Oshkosh, or faded away. Omro started a revitalization process in 1986, and has seen improved growth. Omro has come up with multiple projects to pay its respects to the past while it builds for the future. Some of those projects were; the historical walking tour, the Scott park pavilion project, and the designation of a historic downtown district.&lt;ref&gt;www.omro-wi.com/a-brief-history-of-omro.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''La Crosse''' is a city in and the [[county seat]] of [[La Crosse County, Wisconsin|La Crosse County]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States]]. The city lies alongside the [[Mississippi River]].

As of the 2012 census estimate the population was 51,647.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.doa.state.wi.us/docview.asp?locid=9&amp;docid=7268&lt;/ref&gt; The city forms the core of, and is the principal city in the [[La Crosse Metropolitan Area|La Crosse Metropolitan Statistical Area]], which includes all of La Crosse County and [[Houston County, Minnesota]], with a combined population of 135,298.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.census.gov/popest/data/metro/totals/2012/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; La Crosse is a home to the [[University of Wisconsin-La Crosse]],&lt;ref&gt;http://news.uwlax.edu/u-s-news-uw-l-is-no-3-among-midwests-public-colleges/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Viterbo University]], and [[Western Technical College]].

==History==
La Crosse was incorporated as a city in 1856, but its history dates further. The first Europeans to see the site of La Crosse were [[France|French]] [[fur trade]]rs who traveled the Mississippi River in the late 17th century. There is no written record, however, of any visit to the site until 1805, when Lt. [[Zebulon Pike]] mounted an expedition up the Mississippi River for the [[United States]]. Pike recorded the location's name as &quot;Prairie La Crosse.&quot; The name originated from the game with sticks that resembled a bishop's [[crozier]] or ''[[lacrosse|la crosse]]'' in [[French language|French]], which was played by Native Americans there.&lt;ref&gt;''La Crosse [origin of name].'' Retrieved October 31, 2006, from the Wisconsin Historical Society website: http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&amp;term_id=3421&amp;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diary of Zebulon Pike, September 12, 1805, retrieved from &quot;The Expeditions of Zebulon Pike&quot; by Elliot Coues, 1895&lt;/ref&gt;

The first white settlement at La Crosse occurred in 1841 when [[Nathan Myrick]], a New York native, moved to the village at [[Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin]] to work in the [[fur trade]]. Myrick was disappointed to find that because many fur traders were already well-entrenched there, there were no openings for him in the trade. As a result, he decided to establish a trading post upriver at the then still unsettled site of Prairie La Crosse. In 1841, he built a temporary trading post on Barron Island (now called Pettibone Park), which lies just west of La Crosse's present downtown. The following year, Myrick relocated the post to the mainland prairie, partnering with H.J.B. Miller to run the outfit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historicdowntownlacrosse.com Downtown Mainstreet Inc&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lacrosselibrary.org/genealogy/laxhistory/Ethnicity.asp Brief History of La Crosse County&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The spot Myrick chose to build his trading post proved ideal for settlement. It was near the junction of the [[Black River (Wisconsin)|Black]], [[La Crosse River|La Crosse]], and Mississippi Rivers. In addition, the post was built at one of the few points along the Wisconsin side of the Mississippi River where a broad plain ideal for development existed between the river's bank and the tall [[Hill|bluffs]] that line the river valley. Because of these advantages, a small village grew around Myrick's trading post in the 1840s.

A small [[Mormon]] community settled at La Crosse in 1844, building several dozen cabins a few miles south of Myrick's post. Although these settlers relocated away from the [[Midwest]] after just a year, the land they occupied near La Crosse continues to bear the name Mormon Coulee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.strangite.org/Wisconsin.htm Mormons in Wisconsin&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 23, 1850, Father [[James Lloyd Breck]] of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] said the first Christian liturgy (Episcopalian liturgy) on top of [[Grandad Bluff]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://anglicanhistory.org/usa/jlbreck/letters/04.html The Life of the Reverend James Lloyd Breck, D.D&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Today a monument to that event stands atop the bluff, near the parking lot at a scenic overlook.

More permanent development took place closer to Myrick's trading post, where stores, a hotel, and a post office were constructed during the 1840s. Under the direction of [[Timothy Burns]], lieutenant governor of Wisconsin, surveyor William Hood platted the village in 1851. This opened it up for further settlement, which was achieved rapidly as a result of promotion of the city in eastern newspapers. By 1855, La Crosse had grown in population to nearly two thousand residents, leading to its incorporation in 1856. The city grew even more rapidly after 1858 with the completion of the La Crosse &amp; Milwaukee Railroad, the second railroad connecting [[Milwaukee]] to the Mississippi River.

During the second half of the 19th century, La Crosse grew to become one of the largest cities in Wisconsin. At that time, it was a major economic center in the state, especially of the lumber industry, for logs cut in the interior of the state could be rafted down the Black River toward [[sawmill]]s built in the city. La Crosse also became a center for the [[brewing]] industry and other manufacturers that saw advantages in the city's location adjacent to major transportation arteries, such as the Mississippi River and the railroad between Milwaukee and [[St. Paul, Minnesota]]. Around the turn of the 20th century, the city also became a center for education, with three colleges and universities established in the city between 1890 and 1912.

La Crosse remains the largest city on Wisconsin's western border, and the educational institutions in the city have recently led it toward becoming a regional technology and medical hub.

==Geography==
[[File:Grandadbluff.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Grandad Bluff]] in La Crosse]]
La Crosse is located on the western border of the midsection of [[Wisconsin]], on a broad [[alluvium|alluvial]] plain along the east side of the [[Mississippi River]]. The [[Black River (Wisconsin)|Black River]] empties into the Mississippi north of the city, and the [[La Crosse River]] flows into the Mississippi just north of the downtown area. Just upriver from its mouth, this river broadens into a marshland that splits the city into two distinct sections, north and south.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|22.54|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which, {{convert|20.52|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|2.02|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.&lt;ref name =&quot;Gazetteer files&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surrounding the relatively flat [[prairie]] [[valley]] where La Crosse lies are towering 500&amp;nbsp;ft [[Hill|bluffs]], one of the most prominent of which is [[Grandad Bluff]] (mentioned in [[Life on the Mississippi]] by [[Mark Twain]]), which has an overlook of the three states region. This feature typifies the topography of the [[Driftless Area]] in which La Crosse sits. This rugged region is composed of high ridges dissected by narrow valleys called [[coulee]]s, a French term. As a result, the area around La Crosse is frequently referred to as the &quot;Coulee Region&quot;.

===Climate===
La Crosse's location in the [[United States]]' [[Upper Midwest|upper midwest]]  gives the area a [[temperate]], [[continental climate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Wisconsin State Climatology Office | publisher = University of Wisconsin | year = 2006 | url = http://www.aos.wisc.edu/%7Esco/ | accessdate = 2006-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The warmest month of the year is July, when the average high temperature is 85 °F (29 °C), with overnight low temperatures averaging 63 °F (18 °C).

==Diversity==
The first Southeast Asian refugees to arrive in La Crosse came in 1974. It was a Vietnamese family of five. Then in 1975, the first Cambodian family (of three) settled in this area. The first [[Hmong people|Hmong]] refugees arrived in June 1976. During the next few years, the number of refugees from Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam continued to increase. By 1982, there were approximately 800 Southeast Asian refugees in La Crosse.

To meet the needs of the increasing refugee population, the La Crosse Area Hmong Mutual Assistance Association (HMAA) was formed and incorporated as a non-profit, tax exempt agency in December 1982.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lacrossehmaa.org/HMAA/foundationAndHistory.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Origin of the name===
Early French explorers named the Dells of the Wisconsin River as ''[[dalles]]'', a [[rapid]]s or [[narrows]] on a river in ''[[voyageurs|voyageur]]'' French&lt;ref&gt;Goc (1999), p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early history===
Wisconsin Dells was founded as Kilbourn City in 1857 by [[Byron Kilbourn]], who also founded Kilbourntown, one of the three original towns at the confluence of the [[Milwaukee River|Milwaukee]], [[Menomonee River|Menomonee]], and [[Kinnickinnic River (Milwaukee River)|Kinnickinnic Rivers]] that joined to become [[Milwaukee]]. Before the establishment of Kilbourn City, the region around the dells of the [[Wisconsin River]] was primarily a [[lumbering]] area until 1851, when the [[La Crosse and Milwaukee Railroad]] was chartered, with Kilbourn as its president. The railroad made plans to bridge the Wisconsin River near the river's dells, and a [[boomtown]] named Newport sprang up at the expected site of the bridge in 1853. The population of this new city quickly swelled to over 2,000, but when the railroad finally came through the area in 1857 it took nearly everyone by surprise by crossing the river a mile upstream from the site of Newport. As a result, Newport was rapidly turned into a [[ghost town]] as the settlers flocked to the new city at the site of the railroad bridge, Kilbourn City. The land at the point of crossing was originally owned by Parley Eaton.  Byron Kilbourn bought the land from Eaton for a reduced price as everyone expected the railroad to cross at Newport. However, Kilbourn then went to Madison and lobbied the state to allow for the railroad right-of-way to be moved to cross at the point where he owned the land and greatly increased its value. Gradually, tourism became a large part of Kilbourn City. To make it easier for tourists to identify Kilbourn City with the [[natural landscape]] for which it was famous, the name of the city was changed to Wisconsin Dells in 1931. As the twentieth century progressed, new attractions began to draw even more tourists.

=== Tourism ===
Because of the scenery provided by the dells of the Wisconsin River, Kilbourn City quickly became a popular travel destination in the Midwest. In 1856, Leroy Gates began taking tourists on boat tours of the Wisconsin Dells.  These tours were given using wooden rowboats until 1873 when the first steamboat, the Modocawanda, was used. In 1875, early landscape photographer [[H. H. Bennett]] established a studio in the city and took many photos of the sandstone formations in the dells, including [[stereoscopy|stereoscopic]] views. Prints of these photographs were distributed across the United States, further enhancing the status of Kilbourn City as a destination for sightseers. Taking advantage of this, Bennett began offering to take souvenir pictures of visitors to the dells, becoming one of the first to capitalize on the area's burgeoning tourist trade. Today, the [[H. H. Bennett Studio]] is a historic site operated by the [[Wisconsin Historical Society]].

The Dells region remained primarily a place for sightseers to escape the bustle of the city for many decades. By 1894, [[distillate]]-powered tour boats began to be used. In 1908, the Kilbourn Dam was installed by what is now [[Alliant Energy]], over the protests of people such as H. H. Bennett, separating the Dells into the Upper and Lower Dells.

Since the time of LeRoy Gates, the Dells Boat Tours have gone through many operators. Some of the previous companies were The Riverview Boat Line, the Olson Boat Line, the Dells Boat Company, the Consolidated Boat Company, and the Silver Dollar Boat Line.

A few other events of interest took place during this time, including the June 16, 1911 impact of a 772-gram stony [[meteorite]] in rural [[Columbia County, Wisconsin|Columbia County]] near the city, damaging a barn.

===DUCKS come to the Dells===
In 1946 a Milwaukee native named Mel Flath brought the first amphibious truck ([[DUKW]]) to the Wisconsin Dells. It was an impulse buy that he had made at a government auction in California; the trip's purpose had been to purchase war surplus trucks. Mel opened the &quot;Dells Amphibian Line&quot;, which gave 90-minute tours in the Wisconsin River, exposing tourists to the area's famous sandstone formations. Mel eventually sold his duck fleet to the Associated Boat lines in 1952, which renamed the company the Wisconsin Ducks, Inc. In 1952 the Wisconsin Ducks, founded by [[Jack B. Olson]], began offering tours of the river dells and adjacent areas using decommissioned amphibious [[DUKW]] vehicles from [[World War II]]. However, duck competition was far from over after the 1952 sale. Flath opened up a duck ride again briefly from 1964 to 1966. When he was bought out again, the Soma Boat Company opened its own duck ride on [[Mirror Lake (Wisconsin)|Mirror Lake]], near [[Lake Delton]], which it called the Aquaducks. In response to the competition, Wisconsin Ducks, Inc. assumed the name &quot;Original Wisconsin Ducks&quot;. Aquaducks existed from 1968 until its sale to the boat lines in 1976. In 1977 yet another duck ride began, this one by Flath's daughter and son-in-law, George and Suzanne Field, named Dells Duck Tours, Inc., operating from the same property as Mel had 30 years earlier. This time sporting a red, white and blue exterior, these ducks, while not the &quot;original&quot; ducks that were first brought to the dells, were still World War II production models. Today, the Dells Duck Tours, Inc. are known as the Dells Army Ducks after a paint scheme change in 2002.

=== Growth ===
Lake Delton, Wisconsin Dells's sister city to the south, gradually became popular as the Dells attractions spread out. [[The Wonder Spot]] was founded in Lake Delton in 1952, and remained open until 2006.&lt;ref name=hess&gt;George Hesselberg. &quot;[http://www.lacrossetribune.com/articles/2007/01/12/news/z03spot.txt The Wonder Spot’ to disappear: Old-school Dells tourist attraction closing for good]&quot;. ''La Crosse Tribune''. January 12, 2007. Retrieved on June 5, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952, a new traveling performance from [[Chicago]] called &quot;[[Tommy Bartlett's Thrill Show]]&quot; came to Lake Delton on its second stop. Following the show's huge success in the city, its owner, Tommy Bartlett, chose to keep the performance permanently in Wisconsin Dells. To promote the show, Bartlett gave away [[bumper stickers]] advertising his thrill show and the city, effectively spreading word about the area across the nation. Soon more attractions followed to serve the ever-increasing tourists, along with countless hotels, shops, and restaurants.

==Geography==
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|7.73|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which, {{convert|7.36|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.37|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gazetteer files&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the [[Wisconsin Department of Administration]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.doa.state.wi.us/docs_view2.asp?docid=2270&lt;/ref&gt; on January 19, 2004 the city annexed land from the [[Lyndon, Juneau County, Wisconsin|Town of Lyndon]] in Juneau County, thus expanding the city to include area in four counties.

=== Climate ===
Wisconsin Dells has a [[humid continental climate]], characterized by long, very cold, snowy winters, and warm summers.

On July 13, 1936, the temperature in Wisconsin Dells reached 114 °F (46 °C), the highest ever recorded in the state of [[Wisconsin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Climatological Extremes for Wisconsin - Highest Temperature by Month|url=http://www.aos.wisc.edu/~sco/clim-history/state/wihitemp.html|publisher=Wisconsin State Climatology Office|accessdate=26 August 2013|date=8 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
Tourism is the major contributor to the economy of Wisconsin Dells. The Dells area has many [[indoor waterpark|indoor]] and outdoor [[waterpark]]s, proclaiming itself the &quot;Waterpark Capital of the World&quot;.&lt;ref name=DellsInfo /&gt; Other attractions include boat tours, [[golf]] courses, [[mini golf]], [[go-kart]] tracks, water sports, [[horseback riding]], a water ski show, museums, amusement parks, and a casino.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wisconsin Dells Attractions|url=http://www.dells.com/attractions.html|publisher=Wisconsin Dells Tourism Authority|accessdate=18 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most attractions are located on the Strip, otherwise known as the [[Wisconsin Dells Parkway]]. Accommodations range from economical [[motel]]s to [[RV park]]s to chain hotels to themed [[resort]]s featuring indoor and outdoor waterparks and other amenities.

Since the late 1970s the Dells area (Wisconsin Dells and Lake Delton) has become a water park mecca. [[Noah's Ark Waterpark]] opened in Lake Delton in 1979, and has become the largest and the eighth most visited water park in the U.S.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Other outdoor amusement and water parks followed, featuring water slides, mini golf, [[roller coasters]], [[go-karts]], and other attractions.

The [[Polynesian Resort Hotel]] opened the United States' and the Dells area's first indoor waterpark in 1994. Since then, the number of combination resort/indoor waterparks in the Wisconsin Dells area has swelled, with each new indoor waterpark trying to have the latest innovations in waterslides and to be able to claim the title of America's largest park. The Big 5 Dells resorts with large indoor waterparks are the [[Wilderness Territory]], [[Kalahari Resort]], [[Chula Vista Resort]], [[Great Wolf Lodge]], and Hotel Rome at Mt. Olympus. The three indoor waterparks at the Wilderness Territory have more square feet of waterpark space than any other resort in America.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Kalahari Resort's indoor waterpark is the Dells' largest indoor waterpark under one roof, and is also America's second largest indoor waterpark at {{convert|125000|sqft|m2}} square feet. Additionally, there are other smaller hotels with waterparks such as the [[Atlantis (Wisconsin Dells)|Atlantis Resort]] as well as [[Bluegreen Corporation|Bluegreen]] Odyssey Dells which is adjacent to [[Mt. Olympus Water &amp; Theme Park]] but does not offer an on-site waterpark. These are generally marketed to families with younger children.

In 2005, Big Chief Karts and Coasters merged with the former Family Land Waterpark and Treasure Island Hotel to create a large theme park on the border of Lake Delton and Wisconsin Dells, with a resort called Hotel Rome, an indoor waterpark, outdoor waterpark, theme park, and the area's first indoor theme park. The park, which has roller coasters, go-karts, and water slides, is called [[Mt. Olympus Water &amp; Theme Park]].

The [[Tanger Outlet Center]] opened in 2006 near the Great Wolf Lodge, replacing the defunct Wisconsin Dells Greyhound Park, which opened in May 1990, but closed in 1996 due to heavy competition from the nearby [[Ho-Chunk Casino|Ho-Chunk Gaming Wisconsin Dells]] Bingo/Casino. Since Mt. Olympus opened the Parthenon Indoor Theme Park in 2006, two more indoor theme parks were constructed in the area: Knuckleheads outside the Tanger Complex in 2007, and Kalahari Resort in December 2008. New attractions being constructed include more indoor waterpark resorts, the Grand Cambrian Resort, and the Wedge Resort.

'''Baraboo''' is a city in and the [[county seat]] of [[Sauk County, Wisconsin|Sauk County]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States]].{{GR|2}} The largest city in the county, Baraboo is the principal city of the Baraboo Micropolitan Statistical Area. Its 2010 population was 12,048. It is situated on  the [[Baraboo River]].

Baraboo is home to the [[Circus World Museum]], the former headquarters and winter home of the [[Ringling Brothers]] circus. The [[Al. Ringling Theatre]] is an active landmark in the city.

Baraboo is also the site of the [[International Crane Foundation]]. [[Aldo Leopold]]'s [[Aldo Leopold Shack and Farm|Shack and Farm]] is near Baraboo.

==History==
The area around Baraboo was first settled by Abe Wood in 1838, and was originally known as the village of Adams.&lt;ref&gt;1929 [http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/WI.WIBlueBk1929 ''[[Wisconsin Blue Book]]''], p. 629.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1846 it became the county seat of [[Sauk County, Wisconsin|Sauk County]] after a fierce fight with the nearby village of [[Reedsburg, Wisconsin|Reedsburg]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scls.lib.wi.us/acl/localhistory/past_present/images/00000012.pdf &quot;County Government: Why Adams County?&quot;] in Adams County Historical Society,''From Past to Present: Adams County''. Friendship, Wisconsin: New Past Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1852, the village was renamed &quot;Baraboo&quot;, after the nearby river. It was incorporated as a city in 1882.&lt;ref name=&quot;wisconsinhistory.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&amp;term_id=15087 &quot;Term: Baraboo &amp;#91;brief history&amp;#93;&quot;] in ''Dictionary of Wisconsin History''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Baraboo was the site of several sawmills early in its history because of its location near the [[Baraboo River|Baraboo]] and [[Wisconsin River|Wisconsin]] Rivers.

The city was the home of the [[Ringling Brothers]]. In the 19th century, it was the headquarters of [[Ringling Brothers Circus|their circus]] and several others, leading to the nickname &quot;Circus City&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;wisconsinhistory.org&quot;/&gt; Today Circus World Museum is located in Baraboo. A living history museum, it has a collection of circus wagons and other circus artifacts. It also has the largest library of circus information in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Steigerwald. [http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/sectionfront/life/travels-without-charley-a-beautiful-lake-and-a-movie-palace-await-in-baraboo-268797/ &quot;Travels Without Charley: A beautiful lake and a movie palace await in Baraboo&quot;]. ''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette'', October 17, 2010. Retrieved September 10, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The museum previously hosted the [[Great Circus Parade]], which carried circus wagons and performers through the streets of Baraboo, across the state by train, and then through downtown Milwaukee.

The Al. Ringling Theatre is a grand scale movie palace in downtown Baraboo, made possible through the financial assistance of the Ringling family. The Al Ringling home still exists.

Located near Baraboo is the [[Badger Army Ammunition Plant]], which was the largest munitions factory in the world during WWII, when it was known as &quot;Badger Ordnance Works&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://propertydisposal.gsa.gov/mip/nographics/army/badger/badger.asp GSA - Badger Site Information]&lt;/ref&gt; The plant is no longer in use.

==Geography==
[[File:BarabooWisconsinSignWIS33.jpg|thumb|right|Baraboo welcome sign on [[Wisconsin Highway 33|WIS 33]].]]
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|7.47|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which, {{convert|7.39|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.08|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.&lt;ref name =&quot;Gazetteer files&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baraboo gives its name to the [[Baraboo Syncline]], a doubly plunging, asymmetric [[syncline]] in [[Proterozoic]]-aged [[Baraboo quartzite]].  Researchers at the [[University of Wisconsin]], particularly [[Charles R. Van Hise]], used the syncline to demonstrate that small-scale deformational structures in isolated outcrops reflect larger regional structures and that sedimentary structures could indicate the original top-facing direction within elaborately deformed [[stratum|strata]]. These two principles sparked a global revolution in [[structural geology]] during the 1920s.&lt;ref name=gsabulletin&gt;{{cite journal |first= R.H. |last= Dott, Jr. |title= Wisconsin roots of the modern revolution in structural geology |work= GSA Bulletin |publisher= The Geological Society of America |volume= 113 |number= 8 |pages= 996–1009 |url= http://gsabulletin.gsapubs.org/content/113/8/996.abstract |doi= 10.1130/0016-7606(2001)113&lt;0996:WROTMR |date=2001-08 |accessdate=2013-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nearby [[Baraboo Hills]] are designated one of the &quot;Last Great Places&quot; by the [[Nature Conservancy]] because of their rare rocks, plants and animals. The hills were created by glacial action, and in some points poke up from the flat terrain to form a stark contrast. Some of these features were created when a glacial pocket was formed during the [[Wisconsonian glaciation]] where the advance of the glacier halted. [[Devil's Lake State Park (Wisconsin)|Devil's Lake State Park]], Wisconsin's largest state park, contains large areas of the Baraboo Hills. [[Pewits Nest]] is located outside Baraboo.

==Demographics==
Baraboo forms the core of the [[United States Census Bureau]]'s Baraboo [[Micropolitan Statistical Area]], which includes all of Sauk County (2000 population: 55,225).

'''Green Bay''' is a city in and the [[county seat]] of [[Brown County, Wisconsin|Brown County]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Wisconsin]],{{GR|6}} located at the head of [[Green Bay (Lake Michigan)|Green Bay]], a sub-basin of [[Lake Michigan]], at the mouth of the [[Fox River (Wisconsin)|Fox River]]. It has an elevation of {{convert|581|ft|m}} above sea level and is located {{convert|112|mi|km}} north of [[Milwaukee]]. The population was 104,057 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].{{GR|2}} It is the third-largest city in the state of Wisconsin, after [[Milwaukee]] and [[Madison, WI|Madison]]. It is also the third-largest city on the west shore of Lake Michigan, after [[Chicago]] and Milwaukee.  Green Bay is home to the [[Green Bay Packers]] of the [[National Football League]], making it by far the smallest metropolitan area in the USA to host a major professional sports franchise.

Green Bay is the principal city of the [[Green Bay metropolitan area|Green Bay Metropolitan Statistical Area]], which covers Brown, [[Kewaunee County, Wisconsin|Kewaunee]], and [[Oconto County, Wisconsin|Oconto]] Counties&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.census.gov/population/www/estimates/metro_general/2006/List4.txt METROPOLITAN STATISTICAL AREAS AND COMPONENTS], [[Office of Management and Budget]], 2007-05-11. Accessed 2008-07-30.&lt;/ref&gt; and had a combined population of 306,241 at the [[United States Census, 2010|2010 census]].{{GR|2}}

Green Bay is an industrial city with several [[meatpacking]] and paper plants, and a [[seaport|port]] on [[Green Bay (Lake Michigan)|Green Bay]], an arm of Lake Michigan that locals call ''the Bay of Green Bay'', to avoid conflating it with the eponymous city. It is home to the [[National Railroad Museum]]; the Neville Public Museum, with exhibitions of art, history, and science; and the [[University of Wisconsin–Green Bay]].

==History==
[[Image:heritage hill park.jpg|left|thumb|275px|Heritage Hill State Park in Green Bay]]

[[Jean Nicolet]] was commissioned by [[New France]]’s founder, [[Samuel de Champlain]] to form a peaceful alliance with Indians whose unrest was interfering with French trade and to possibly find a shorter trade route to China through Canada. Nicolet and others had learned of the existence of the [[Ho-Chunk]] (Winnebago) people, who referred to themselves as &quot;People of the Sea&quot;, and believed they must reside on or near the Pacific Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&amp;term_id=2330&amp;keyword=nicolet&lt;/ref&gt; Champlain had also heard about resources in the area, including fertile soil, forests, and animals. Nicolet set out on his journey for this new land shortly before winter in 1634.&lt;ref name&gt;City of Green Bay. &quot;City of Green Bay.&quot; www.ci.green-bay.wi.us. 5 Oct. 2008 &lt;http://www.ci.green-bay.wi.us/geninfo/history_o.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In what later became a French fur-trading route, he sailed up the Ottawa River, through [[Lake Nipissing]] and down the [[French River (Ontario)|French River]] to [[Lake Huron]], then through the straits of [[Michilimackinac]] into Lake Michigan and is believed to have landed at Red Banks, near the modern-day city of Green Bay.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.enchantedlearning.com/explorers/page/n/nicollet.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

A small trading post, originally named ''La Baye'' or ''La Baie des Puants'' (French for &quot;the stinking Bay&quot;), was established by Nicolet at this location in 1634,&lt;ref name=&quot;Nicolet&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Jean Nicolet | url = http://www.uwgb.edu/wisfrench/library/articles/nicolet.htm | author = Rodesch, Jerrold C. | year = 1984 | publisher = [[University of Wisconsin–Green Bay]] | accessdate=2007-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; making Green Bay one of the oldest permanent settlements in America. When Nicolet arrived in the Green Bay area, the first group he encountered was the Menominee, as Green Bay was in their territory. There was also one that spoke a [[Sioux]] language, the [[Ho-Chunk]], also known as the Winnebago. Besides hunting and fishing, the Winnebagos cultivated corn, bean, squash, and tobacco. Wild rice, a dietary staple, grew in abundance in the river and its tributaries, and was gathered along with nuts, berries, and edible roots of the woods.&quot;&lt;ref name&gt;City of Green Bay. &quot;City of Green Bay.&quot; www.ci.green-bay.wi.us. 5 Oct. 2008 &lt;http://www.ci.green-bay.wi.us/geninfo/history_o.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In this tribe there were distinguished and easily identified gender roles. The men typically hunted and fished for food, and the women cooked and prepared the furs of the dead animals for rugs, furniture and other uses around the house. Women were an important aspect of the political process, as no action could be taken without agreement of half of the women. Nicolet stayed with this tribe for about a year, becoming an ally, which helped open up opportunities for trade and commerce. He then returned to Quebec.&lt;ref name&gt;City of Green Bay. &quot;City of Green Bay.&quot; www.ci.green-bay.wi.us. 5 Oct. 2008 &lt;http://www.ci.green-bay.wi.us/geninfo/history_o.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

A few months after Nicolet returned from his quest, Champlain died. His death put a halt on journeys to the newly discovered land, La Baie Verte (French for The Green Bay).

[[Nicolas Perrot]] was the next journeyman sent to La Baie by Pere [[Claude Allouez]]. After this, the French avoided the area because of the intensity of Indian and European wars. In 1671 a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] Mission was set up in the area. A fort was added in 1717. The town was incorporated in 1754, and was passed to [[United Kingdom|British]] control in 1761.

[[File:Green Bay 1867.jpg|thumb|right|1867 bird's eye illustration of Green Bay]]
The first permanent French settler was [[Charles de Langlade]] and his family, who moved to Green Bay in 1765, becoming the first permanent settlers in Wisconsin. Langlade, called the &quot;Founder and Father of Wisconsin&quot;, was a half-French [[Ottawa]] war chief who is credited with planning the ambush of British [[Edward Braddock|General Braddock]] and [[George Washington]] in the [[French and Indian War]]. The Grignons, Porliers and Lawes who followed brought Canadian-French culture with them. Colorful &quot;jack-knife Judge&quot; Reaume dispensed British justice in the territory.”&lt;ref name&gt;City of Green Bay. &quot;City of Green Bay.&quot; www.ci.green-bay.wi.us. 5 Oct. 2008 &lt;http://www.ci.green-bay.wi.us/geninfo/history_o.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; These early French settlers set the tone for the remainder who came to the area.

[[File:2009-0620-WI004-GB-Hazelwood.jpg|left|thumb|275px|Built in 1837, the Hazelwood Historic House Museum was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1964 and is home of the Brown County Historical Society.&lt;ref name=GBPG071609&gt;Warren Gerds, [http://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/article/99999999/GPG04/711280632/0/specials A is for architecture: Hazelwood stands out in Greek Revival style], ''Press-Gazette'', July 16, 2009, Accessed July 16, 2009. {{Dead link|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The Green Bay area was still under British control until years after the end of the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], even after America had gained its independence. &quot;Doty, Whitney, Arndt, Baird and Martin were among the American settlers who pushed French culture into the background following the American establishment of [[Fort Howard (Wisconsin)|Fort Howard]] in 1816.&quot;&lt;ref name&gt;City of Green Bay. &quot;City of Green Bay.&quot; www.ci.green-bay.wi.us. 5 Oct. 2008 &lt;http://www.ci.green-bay.wi.us/geninfo/history_o.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; As British settlers in the area came to outnumber the French, the name &quot;Green Bay&quot; (from the French: ''Baie Verte'') became the more common name for the town. In 1783 the town became part of the [[United States|United States of America]]. The [[United States Army]] built [[Fort Howard (Wisconsin)|Fort Howard]] on the banks of the Fox River in 1816.

Before Wisconsin became a state in 1848, the majority of commerce had to do with fur trading. After statehood, there was a shift away from fur trading toward lumbering. &quot;For a short time in 1860s and 1870s, iron smelting in charcoal kilns rivaled the timber industry while the port handled increasing amounts of fuel, feed, and lumber. Today's major local industry had its start in 1865 when the first paper mill was built.&quot;&lt;ref name&gt;City of Green Bay. &quot;City of Green Bay.&quot; www.ci.green-bay.wi.us. 5 Oct. 2008 &lt;http://www.ci.green-bay.wi.us/geninfo/history_o.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Wisconsin's first newspaper, ''The [[Green Bay Intelligencer]]'', was first published in 1833 by [[Albert Gallatin Ellis|Albert Ellis]] and [[John Voorhees Suydam|John V. Suydam]]. The borough of Green Bay was created in 1838 and is the main center of the current city.  The borough combined the town of Astor (a company town of the [[American Fur Company]]), with Navarino, platted by [[Daniel Whitney (Wisconsin entrepreneur)|Daniel Whitney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Martin |first1=Deborah Beaumont |last2=Beaumont |first2=Sophie |title=Old Green Bay |url=http://www.archive.org/details/oldgreenbay00mart |accessdate=September 13, 2013 |year=1899 |publisher=Cheltenham Press |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1850 the town had a population of 1,923. The town was incorporated as the city of Green Bay in 1854. The [[Green Bay Area Public School District]] was founded in 1856.&lt;ref name&gt;City of Green Bay. &quot;City of Green Bay.&quot; www.ci.green-bay.wi.us. 5 Oct. 2008 &lt;http://www.ci.green-bay.wi.us/geninfo/history_o.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1850s brought much change to the city of Green Bay when other groups started immigrating to the area. That decade brought an influx of Belgian, German, Scandinavian, Irish and Dutch immigrants as word spread of America's cheap land and good soil. The greatest concentration of newcomers came from Belgium. They cleared the land to farm and build their homes.&lt;ref name&gt;City of Green Bay. &quot;City of Green Bay.&quot; www.ci.green-bay.wi.us. 5 Oct. 2008 &lt;http://www.ci.green-bay.wi.us/geninfo/history_o.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The railroad arrived in the 1860s. Chicago and Northwestern Railroad companies were formed, which allowed people and products to travel all over the state, increasing business and trade opportunities. The area was able to grow and enrich itself with the use of the river and the plentiful timber resources. This led to the paper industry becoming the major employer in Green Bay, and opened up the port for international trade.&lt;ref name&gt;City of Green Bay. &quot;City of Green Bay.&quot; www.ci.green-bay.wi.us. 5 Oct. 2008 &lt;http://www.ci.green-bay.wi.us/geninfo/history_o.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Downtown Green Bay.JPG|thumb|right|Facing east across the Fox River to downtown Green Bay.]]

In 1934, President Franklin D. Roosevelt came to Green Bay to honor its tercentenary.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nicolet&quot;/&gt; By 1950 the city had a population of 52,735. In 1964, the Town of [[Preble, Wisconsin|Preble]] was consolidated with the city of Green Bay.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ci.green-bay.wi.us/geninfo/mayors_past/mayor_denissen_o.html Mayor Denissen&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
Green Bay is located at the end of [[Interstate 43]], about {{Convert|90|mi}} north of [[Milwaukee]].

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|55.96|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which, {{convert|45.47|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|10.49|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.&lt;ref name =&quot;Gazetteer files&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===
The climate of Green Bay is similar to that of many other cities in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Dfb'' inland, ''Dfa'' on the lake), with some moderation due to the city's proximity to [[Lake Michigan]]. Like other cities with this type of climate, there are four distinct [[season]]s, often with severe or extreme variation between them in terms of temperature and precipitation. Green Bay experiences warm, humid, frequently hot summers and long, cold and [[snow]]y winters. The variance in temperature and precipitation between months is severe and often extreme.

====Temperature====
Monthly mean temperatures range from {{convert|16.6|°F|1}} in January to {{convert|69.1|°F|1}} in July.&lt;ref name=NOAA/&gt; In July, the warmest month, the average high temperature is {{convert|81.2|°F|1}}.&lt;ref name=NOAA/&gt; There are 6.1 days of {{convert|90|F|0}}+ highs, 68 days where the high remains at or below freezing, and 19 days with sub-{{convert|0|F|0}} lows annually. From December to February, even during thaws, the temperature rarely reaches {{convert|50|F|0}}. Extremes have ranged from {{convert|−36|F|0}} on January 21, 1888 to {{convert|104|F|0}} on July 13, 1936.

====Precipitation====
The wettest month in Green Bay is August, when 3.77&amp;nbsp;inches (95.8&amp;nbsp;mm) of precipitation falls, mostly in the form of rainfall from [[thunderstorm]]s. The driest month in Green Bay is February, when the majority of precipitation falls as low moisture-content snow due to cold, dry air. On average, 1.01&amp;nbsp;inches (25.7&amp;nbsp;mm) of precipitation falls in February.

Green Bay's unofficial nickname is &quot;Titletown, USA&quot; &lt;ref name=Wisconsin /&gt; for the record number of NFL championship titles (13) the Packers have won, including four [[Super Bowl]]s in 1967, 1968, 1997 and 2011. &quot;Titletown&quot; appears on the city seal, is used by the Green Bay Chamber of Commerce for its web address, and appears in the name of more than two dozen local businesses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/titletown/news/story?id=3336558 ESPN.com, &quot;There is no other TitleTown USA&quot;, April 10, 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Joseph Dessert Library ==
[[Joseph Dessert]] came from Canada to Mosinee (then known as &quot;Little Bull Falls&quot;) in 1844. He decided that a library was needed and built and equipped a free library for the community. 

Dedicated on February 11, 1899, the building was used as a library as well as a post office, village hall, and school, and it was the scene of many community events, including dances and balls. The library was the only place in town with theater facilities, so amateur plays were often presented there, and school commencements were held in the Grand Hall. The library existed as a city library until 1974, when the library and municipal boards recommended that the Joseph Dessert Library should join the [[Marathon County Public Library]] ([[Marathon County Public Library|MCPL]]). Since then, it has also come to be known as the [[Marathon County Public Library - Mosinee Branch|MCPL - Mosinee Branch]].

Celebrations have marked two significant anniversaries for the library, the first in 1949 at the 50th anniversary, and the second in 1999 at the time of the library's 100th year. Several renovations have also taken place, with the most recent occurring in 1995 as part of a county-wide building and improvement program for libraries. Today, the library maintains its status in the City of Mosinee as both an important community service and as a building significant to the history of the community. The library building is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

==History==
===Mock Communist invasion===
On May 1, 1950, local residents acting as [[Communist]] invaders seized control of Mosinee.&lt;ref&gt;Richard M. Fried, 1998. ''The Russians are Coming! The Russians are Coming! Pageantry and Patriotism in Cold-War America'' (Oxford University Press, New York, ch. 4).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=jvrRlaHg2sAC&amp;dat=19500501&amp;printsec=frontpage&amp;hl=en &quot;Mosinee in Hands of 'Reds' After a Make Believe Coup&quot;, ''Milwaukee Journal'', May 1, 1950]&lt;/ref&gt;

The action was a part of an elaborate pageant organized by the Wisconsin Department of the [[American Legion]].  The &quot;Communists&quot; dragged Mayor [[Ralph E. Kronenwetter]] and Police Chief Carl Gewiss out of their beds. Mayor Kronenwetter surrendered at 10:15 AM in the town's new &quot;[[Red Square]]&quot; with a pistol to his back. The police chief was reported to have resisted and was &quot;liquidated&quot;.

Roadblocks were set up around Mosinee, the library was &quot;purged&quot;, prices of goods were inflated for the duration of the coup, and local restaurants served Russian [[black bread]] and potato soup for lunch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60611F8385F177A93C0A9178ED85F448585F9 Town Deserts U.S. For Day In Soviet; The 'Communists' Take Over A Wisc... - Free Preview - The New York Times&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 

As he arrived at a rally to restore democracy to the community the night of May 1 Mayor Kronenwetter suffered a [[cerebral hemorrhage]] and never regained consciousness. He died five days later on May 6, 1950 at age 49. The mayor's doctor said the excitement and exertion probably contributed to his collapse.

Franklin Baker, commander of the local American Legion post, said, &quot;It was a terrible coincidence.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F1081FF8385B177B93CAA9178ED85F448585F9 MAYOR, MINISTER DEAD AFTER MOCK RED COUP - Free Preview - The New York Times&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Local minister Will La Brew Bennett, 72, who, during the Communist invasion, demonstrated to the media how he would hide his Bible in the church organ if the Communists really invaded and was herded with other residents into a barbed-wire ringed &quot;[[concentration camp]]&quot; near &quot;Red Square&quot;, was found dead in his bed hours after the mayor's death on May 7, 1950.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.conelrad.com/books/flyleaf.php?id=360_0_1_0_M&lt;/ref&gt;

Footage from the &quot;invasion&quot; was used in the movie ''[[The Atomic Cafe]]''.

'''Crandon''' is a [[Political subdivisions of Wisconsin#City|city]] in [[Forest County, Wisconsin|Forest County]], [[Wisconsin]], United States; it is in the northeastern part of the state, about {{convert|100|mi|km}} north of [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]]. The population was 1,920 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Census 2010&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://factfinder2.census.gov| title=Race, Hispanic or Latino, Age, and Housing Occupancy: 2010 Census Redistricting Data (Public Law 94-171) Summary File (QT-PL), Crandon city, Wisconsin| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau, American FactFinder 2| accessdate=August 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the [[county seat]] of Forest County and is the only [[Municipal corporation|incorporated]] community in the county. The city is located adjacent to the [[Crandon (town), Wisconsin|Town of Crandon]].

==History==
Samuel Shaw, an entrepreneur and capitalist, bought property in the area of [[Forest County, Wisconsin|Forest County]] in the 1880s, formerly [[Oconto County, Wisconsin|Oconto County]]. With the aide of Major Frank P. Crandon, tax commissioner with the [[Chicago and North Western Transportation Company]], he successfully lobbied the [[Wisconsin Legislature]] for the creation of Forest County, which was established in 1887. Because of his help, Frank Crandon became the namesake for the county seat. Rail service arrived shortly thereafter in the region via the [[Soo Line Railroad]], but a [[spur line]] did not directly reach the town until the turn of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.forestcountyhistory.org/ | title= History of Forest County | publisher= Forest County Historical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The lumber industry defined the early growth of the city. In 1891, Page and Landeck Lumber Company purchased a tract of hardwood timberlands near Crandon, and by 1902, the company built a huge sawmill (later named the Keith &amp; Hiles Lumber Mill) near Clear Lake on Crandon's north side. The population of Crandon grew from 800 to more than 2,400 in just a few years. With the rail line's presence, settlers and loggers from [[Kentucky]] were recruited for the bustling timber industry of northern Wisconsin. The company's sawmill eventually was moved to Crandon from [[Glasgow, Kentucky]]. Modern culture lore reflects the early &quot;Kentuck&quot; ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.forestcountywi.com/events/ForestCountyVG12007.pdf | title= 2007 Forest County Visitors Guide | publisher= Crandon Chamber of Commerce | year= 2007|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city was officially incorporated as Crandon in 1909 after construction of the county courthouse began, and much of the town's building stock was constructed during this time. Though timber has diminished as a prominent industry in the north-central United States, logging companies still operate in the nearby [[Nicolet National Forest]]. 

From the 1980s to 2003, Crandon was the center of an environmental debate to construct a mining operation at the proposed [[Crandon mine]], a rich [[copper]] deposit discovered by the [[Exxon]] Coal and Minerals Company. The heated discussion led to a Wisconsin Legislature mining moratorium act in 1998. Eventually, the proposed company and mine site lands were purchased by the opposed Mole Lake Sakaogon [[Chippewa]] and Forest County [[Potawatomi]] tribes, whose reservations sat near the site. The project was withdrawn in October 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.geotimes.org/jan04/resources.html | title=Controversial mineral deposit sold | author= Naomi Lubick | publisher= Geotimes | date= 2004-01 | accessdate=2007-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dnr.state.wi.us/org/es/science/crandon/ | title= Proposed Crandon Mine Information | publisher=Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources | date= 2003-10-28 | accessdate=2007-10-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 7, 2007, Crandon drew the attention of national and world media when [[Crandon, Wisconsin shooting|Tyler Peterson]], an employee of the Forest County Sheriff's Department and a part-time officer for the Crandon Police Department, shot seven people, wounding one and killing six in the town. They ranged in age from 14 to 20.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gunman kills six in US Midwest | publisher=BBC | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/7032971.stm | date=2007-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Suspected Gunman Killed After Shooting 6 in Forest County | publisher=WTMJ | url=http://www.620wtmj.com/news/local/10299757.html | date=2007-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/10/07/wisconsin.shooting/index.html | title=Shooter dead along with six victims in rampage - CNN.com}} {{Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20071008/ap_on_re_us/wisconsin_shooting&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Milwaukee''' {{IPAc-en|m|ɪ|l|ˈ|w|ɔː|k|iː}} is the largest city in the U.S. state of [[Wisconsin]], the [[List of United States cities by population|30th most populous]] city in the [[United States]], and [[Table of United States Metropolitan Statistical Areas|39th most populous]] region in the United States. It is the [[county seat]] of [[Milwaukee County, Wisconsin|Milwaukee County]] and is located on the southwestern shore of [[Lake Michigan]]. According to 2010 census data, the City of Milwaukee has a population of {{formatnum:594833}}.&lt;ref name=2010PopWis&gt;{{cite web| url = http://2010.census.gov/news/releases/operations/cb11-cn80.html | title = U.S. Census Bureau Delivers Wisconsin's 2010 Census Population Totals, Including First Look at Race and Hispanic Origin Data for Legislative Redistricting | format = [[comma-separated values|CSV]] | work = 2010 Census Data | publisher = [[United States Census Bureau]], Population Division | date = 2011-03-10 | accessdate = 2011-04-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Milwaukee is the main cultural and economic center of the Milwaukee–Waukesha–West Allis Metropolitan Statistical Area, with an estimated population of 1,566,981 as of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[[List of Core Based Statistical Areas|List of Core Based Statistical Areas - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia]].

The first Europeans to pass through the area were [[France|French]] [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] missionaries and [[fur trade]]rs. In 1818, the [[French Canadian|French-Canadian]] explorer [[Solomon Juneau]] settled in the area, and in 1846 Juneau's town combined with two neighboring towns to incorporate as the City of Milwaukee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://192.159.83.40/SOS/pdf/THEOSOS_025/images/00014104.pdf |title=City of Milwaukee Incorporated, page 164, 1846; page 314, 1851 |accessdate=2007-04-08 |author=City of Milwaukee |publisher=Office of the Secretary of State of Wisconsin|format=PDF |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070605144656/http://192.159.83.40/SOS/pdf/THEOSOS_025/images/00014104.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large numbers of [[German people|German]] and other immigrants helped increase the city's population during the 1840s and the following decades.

Known for its [[brewing]] traditions, major new additions to the city include the [[Milwaukee Riverwalk]], the [[Wisconsin Center]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brandt|first=Jaclyn|title=Delta Center sign change will cost almost $100,000|url=http://www.todaystmj4.com/news/local/212360431.html|newspaper=Today's TMJ 4|date=June 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Miller Park (Milwaukee)|Miller Park]], an internationally renowned addition to the [[Milwaukee Art Museum]], [[Milwaukee Repertory Theater]], and [[Pier Wisconsin]], as well as major renovations to the [[U.S. Cellular Arena]]. In addition, many new skyscrapers, condos, lofts and apartments have been constructed in [[Neighborhoods of Milwaukee|neighborhoods]] on and near the lakefront and riverbanks.

There have been [[USS Milwaukee|five ships]] of the [[United States Navy]] named after the city, including [[USS Milwaukee (LCS-5)|USS ''Milwaukee'' (LCS-5)]].

==History==
{{Main|History of Milwaukee}}
[[File:Solomon Juneau.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of [[Solomon Juneau]], who helped establish the city of Milwaukee]]
The Milwaukee area was originally inhabited by the [[Menominee]], [[Fox (tribe)|Fox]], [[Mascouten]], [[Sauk people|Sauk]], [[Potawatomi]], [[Ojibwe]] (all Algic/Algonquian peoples) and [[Ho-Chunk|Ho-Chunk (Winnebago)]] (a Siouan people) [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes. French missionaries and traders first passed through the area in the late 17th and 18th centuries. Alexis Laframboise, in 1785, coming from Michilimackinac (now in Michigan) settled a trading post; therefore, he is the first European descent resident of the Milwaukee region.&lt;ref name=&quot;St-Pierre, T 1895&quot;&gt;St-Pierre, T. 2000; 1895. Histoire des canadiens du michigan et du comté d'essex, ontario. Cahiers du septentrion. Vol. 17. Sillery, Québec: Septentrion.&lt;/ref&gt; The word &quot;Milwaukee&quot; may come from the [[Potawatomi language]] ''minwaking'', or [[Ojibwe language]] ''ominowakiing'', &quot;Gathering place [by the water]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;WGBruce&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last= Bruce |first= William George |year= 1936 |title= A Short History of Milwaukee |location= Milwaukee, Wisconsin |publisher= The Bruce Publishing Company |pages= 15–16|lccn= 36010193 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freelang.net/dictionary/ojibwe.html |title=Ojibwe Dictionary |publisher=[[Freelang]] |accessdate=2007-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early explorers called the Milwaukee River and surrounding lands various names: Melleorki, Milwacky, Mahn-a-waukie, Milwarck, and Milwaucki. For many years, printed records gave the name as &quot;Milwaukie&quot;. One story of Milwaukee's name says,
{{quote|[O]ne day during the thirties of the last century [1800s] a newspaper calmly changed the name to Milwaukee, and Milwaukee it has remained until this day.&lt;ref name=&quot;WGBruce&quot;/&gt;}}
The spelling &quot;Milwaukie&quot; lives on in [[Milwaukie, Oregon]], named after the Wisconsin city in 1847, before the current spelling was universally accepted.

Milwaukee was first settled by a [[French Canadian]] called Alexis Laframboise in 1785; it was only a trading post.&lt;ref name=&quot;St-Pierre, T 1895&quot;/&gt;  Therefore, Solomon Juneau was not the first to arrive in the area, in 1818. However, Juneau founded the town called Juneau's Side, or Juneautown, that began attracting more settlers. [[Byron Kilbourn]] was Juneau's equivalent on the west side of the [[Milwaukee River]]. In competition with Juneau, he established Kilbourntown west of the Milwaukee River, and made sure the streets running toward the river did not join with those on the east side. This accounts for the large number of angled bridges that still exist in Milwaukee today. Further, Kilbourn distributed maps of the area which only showed Kilbourntown, implying Juneautown did not exist or that the east side of the river was uninhabited and thus undesirable. The third prominent builder was [[George H. Walker]]. He claimed land to the south of the Milwaukee River, along with Juneautown, where he built a log house in 1834. This area grew and became known as Walker's Point.

By the 1840s, the three towns had grown quite a bit, along with their rivalries. There were some intense battles between the towns, mainly Juneautown and Kilbourntown, which culminated with the [[Milwaukee Bridge War]] of 1845. Following the Bridge War, it was decided the best course of action was to officially unite the towns. So, on January 31, 1846, they combined to incorporate as the City of Milwaukee and elected [[Solomon Juneau]] as Milwaukee's first mayor.

Milwaukee began to grow as a city as high numbers of immigrants, mainly German, made their way to Wisconsin during the 1840s and 1850s.  Scholars classify [[German immigration to the United States]] in three major waves, and Wisconsin received a significant number of immigrants from all three.  The first wave from 1845-1855 consisted mainly of people from Southwestern Germany, the second wave from 1865-1873 concerned primarily Northwestern Germany, while the third wave from 1880 to 1893 came from Northeastern Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bungert, Heike 2006&quot;&gt;Bungert, Heike, Cora Lee Kluge and Robert C. Ostergren. ''Wisconsin German Land and Life''. Madison: [[Max Kade Institute]] for German-American Studies, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1840s, the number of people who left German speaking lands was 385,434, in the 1850s it reached 976,072, and an all-time high of 1.4 million emigrated in the 1880s.  In 1890, the 2.78 million first-generation German Americans represented the second largest foreign-born group in the United States.  Of all those who left the German lands between 1835-1910, 90 percent went to the United States, most of them traveling to the Mid-Atlantic states and the Midwest.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bungert, Heike 2006&quot;/&gt;

One of the major destinations of German immigrants was Wisconsin.  By 1900, 34 percent of its population was of German background.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bungert, Heike 2006&quot;/&gt;  The largest number of German immigrants to Milwaukee came from Prussia, followed by Bavaria, Saxony, Hanover, and Hesse-Darmstadt.  Milwaukee gained its reputation for the most German of American cities not just from the large number of German immigrants it received, but the sense of community which the immigrants established there.&lt;ref name=&quot;Conzen, Kathleen Neils 1860&quot;&gt;Conzen, Kathleen Neils. ''Immigrant Milwaukee, 1836-1860''. Cambridge, Massachusetts and London, England: [[Harvard University Press]], 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most German immigrants came to Wisconsin in search of inexpensive farmland.&lt;ref name=&quot;Conzen, Kathleen Neils 1860&quot;/&gt; However, immigration began to change in character and size in the late 1840s and early 1850s, due to the 1848 revolutionary movements in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Conzen, Kathleen Neils. “’The German Athens’ Milwaukee and the Accommodation of Its Immigrants 1836-1860.” PhD diss., vol. 1, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; After 1848, hopes for a united Germany had failed, and revolutionary and radical Germans, known as the &quot;Forty-Eighters,&quot; turned their attention to the United States.  One of the most famous “liberal revolutionaries” of 1848 was [[Carl Schurz]], who explained why he came to Milwaukee in 1854, “It is true, similar things [cultural events and societies] were done in other cities where the Forty-eighters [sic] had congregated. But so far as I know, nowhere did their influence so quickly impress itself upon the whole social atmosphere as in 'German Athens of America' as Milwaukee was called at the time.”&lt;ref&gt;“Milwaukee and Watertown as Seen by Schurz in 1854.” ''[[Milwaukee Journal]]'', October 21, 1941. [[Wisconsin Historical Society]]. http://wisconsinhistory.org (accessed February 5, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

Schurz was referring to the various clubs and societies that Germans developed in Milwaukee. The pattern of German immigrants to settle near each other encouraged the continuation of German lifestyle and customs.  This resulted in German language organizations that encompassed all aspects of life; for example, singing societies and gymnastics clubs.  Germans also made a lasting impact on the American school system.  Kindergarten was created as a pre-school for children, and sports programs of all levels, as well as music and art were incorporated as elements of the regular school curriculum.  These ideas were first introduced by radical-democratic German groups, such as the Socialist Turner Societies, known today as the [[American Turners]]. Specifically in Milwaukee, the American Turners established its own Normal College for teachers of physical education and a German-English Academy.&lt;ref&gt;Rippley, LaVern J. and Eberhard Reichmann, trans. “The German Americans, An Ethnic Experience.” [http://maxkade.iupui.edu Max Kade German-American Center] and [[Indiana University-Purdue University at Indianapolis]]. (accessed February 5, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

Milwaukee's German element is still strongly present today.  The city celebrates its German culture by annually hosting a German Fest in July and an Oktoberfest in October.  Milwaukee boasts a good number of German restaurants, as well as a traditional German beer hall.  Even the German language is not lost, as a German language immersion school is offered for children in grades [[K-5 (education)|K-5]].  Germans were, and still are, an important component of life in Wisconsin and Milwaukee.

Although the German presence in Milwaukee after the Civil War remained strong, other groups made their way to the city. Foremost among these were [[Polish people|Polish]] immigrants. The Poles had many reasons for leaving their homeland, mainly poverty and political oppression. Because Milwaukee offered the Polish immigrants an abundance of low-paying entry level jobs, it became one of the largest [[Polish settlements in the USA]].

For many residents, [[Neighborhoods of Milwaukee#Milwaukee's South Side|Milwaukee's South Side]] is synonymous with the [[Milwaukee#Polish immigrants|Polish community]] which settled here.  The group's proud ethnicity maintained a high profile here for decades and it was not until the 1950s and 1960s that the families began to disperse to the southern suburbs.

By 1850, there were seventy-five Poles in [[Milwaukee County, Wisconsin|Milwaukee County]] and the [[US Census]] indicates that they had a variety of occupations: grocers, blacksmiths, tavernkeepers, coopers, butchers, broommakers, shoemakers, draymen, laborers, and farmers.  Three distinct Polish communities evolved in Milwaukee, with the majority settling in the area south of Greenfield Avenue.  Milwaukee County's Polish population of 30,000 in 1890 rose to 100,000 by 1915.  Poles historically have had a strong national cultural and social identity, maintained through the Catholic Church.  A view of Milwaukee's South Side skyline is replete with the steeples of the many churches these immigrants built, churches that are still vital centers of the community.

[[St. Stanislaus Catholic Church (Milwaukee, Wisconsin)|St. Stanislaus Catholic Church]] and the surrounding [[Neighborhoods of Milwaukee|neighborhood]] was the center of Polish life in Milwaukee. As the Polish community surrounding St. Stanislaus continued to grow, Mitchell Street became known as the '''&quot;Polish Grand Avenue&quot;'''. As Mitchell Street grew denser, the Polish population started moving south to the [[Lincoln Village, City of Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Lincoln Village neighborhood]], home to the [[Basilica of St. Josaphat]] and [[Lincoln Village, City of Milwaukee, Wisconsin#Kosciuszko Park|Kosciuszko Park]].  Other Polish communities started on the east side of Milwaukee and [[Neighborhoods of Milwaukee#Jones Island|Jones Island]], a major commercial fishing center settled mostly by Poles from the Baltic Coast.

Milwaukee has the fourth-largest Polish population in the U.S. at 57,485 (9.6% of the city's population), ranking behind [[New York City]] 213,447 (2.7%), [[Chicago]] 210,421 (7.3%), and [[Philadelphia]] 65,508 (4.3%). The city holds [[Polish Fest]], an annual celebration of [[Polish culture]] and [[Polish food|cuisine]].

In addition to the Germans and Poles, Milwaukee received large influxes of other [[Europe]]an immigrants from [[Lithuania]], [[Italy]], [[Ireland]], [[France]], [[Russia]], [[Bohemia]] and [[Sweden]], which included [[American Jews|Jews]], [[Lutherans]], and [[Catholics]]. [[Italian Americans]] number in the city at around 40,000 but, in Milwaukee County they number at 110,000. The largest Italian American festival, Festa Italiana is held in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~gbhs/resources/unitedstates/Milwaukee.html|title=Aus dem Egerland, nach Milwaukee|last=Muehlhans-Karides|first=Susan|accessdate=2009-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1910, Milwaukee shared the distinction with [[New York City]] of having the largest percentage of foreign-born residents in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.uwm.edu/Library/digilib/Milwaukee/records/picture.html| title=Picturing Milwaukee's Neighborhoods| publisher=[[University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee]]| year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1910, whites represented 99.7% of the city's total population of 373 857.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Historical Census Statistics On Population Totals By Race, 1790 to 1990, and By Hispanic Origin, 1970 to 1990, For Large Cities And Other Urban Places In The United States|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|url=http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html|accessdate=2011-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Milwaukee has a strong [[Greek Orthodox]] Community, many of whom attend the Greek Orthodox Church on Milwaukee's northwest side, designed by [[Wisconsin]]-born architect [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]. Milwaukee has a sizable [[Croats|Croatian]] population with Croatian churches and their own historic and successful soccer club [[Croatian Eagles|The Croatian Eagles]] located at the 30 acre Croatian Park in Franklin, WI. 

Milwaukee also has a large [[Serbs|Serbian]] population with Serbian restaurants, a [[St. Sava Orthodox School|Serbian K-8 School]], Serbian churches along with an American Serb Hall. The American Serb Hall in Milwaukee is known for its Friday fish fries and popular events.  Many U.S. presidents have visited Milwaukee's Serb Hall in the past. The Bosnian population is growing in Milwaukee as well due to the recent migration after the war in [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]].

During this time, a small community of [[African American]]s who emigrated from the [[Southern United States|South]] formed a community that would come to be known as [[Neighborhoods of Milwaukee#Bronzeville|Bronzeville]]. As industry boomed, the African-American influence grew in Milwaukee.

By 1925, there were around 9,000 [[Mexican Americans]] that lived in Milwaukee, but the [[Great Depression]] forced many of them to move back home. In the 1950s, the Hispanic community was beginning to emerge. They arrived for jobs, filling positions in the manufacturing and agricultural sectors. During this time there were labor shortages due to the immigration laws that restricted Europeans from immigrating to the United States. Additionally, strikes contributed to the labor shortages.&lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;[http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/turningpoints/tp-052/?action=more_essay Wisconsinhistory.org], additional text.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the first half of the 20th century, Milwaukee was the major city in which the [[Socialist Party of America]] earned the highest votes. Milwaukee elected three [[mayor]]s who ran on the ticket of the Socialist Party: [[Emil Seidel]] (1910–1912), [[Daniel Hoan]] (1916–1940), and [[Frank Zeidler]] (1948–1960). Often referred to as &quot;[[Sewer Socialism|Sewer Socialists]]&quot;, the Milwaukee Socialists were characterized by their practical approach to government and labor.

===Historic neighborhoods===

[[File:Third Ward MKEa.jpg|thumb|The historic Third Ward]]
In 1892, [[Whitefish Bay, Wisconsin|Whitefish Bay]], [[South Milwaukee, Wisconsin|South Milwaukee]], and [[Wauwatosa, Wisconsin|Wauwatosa]] were incorporated. They were followed by [[Cudahy, Wisconsin|Cudahy]] (1895), North Milwaukee (1897) and East Milwaukee, later known as [[Shorewood, Wisconsin|Shorewood]], in 1900. In the early 20th century [[West Allis, Wisconsin|West Allis]] (1902) and [[West Milwaukee, Wisconsin|West Milwaukee]] (1906) were added, which completed the first generation of &quot;inner-ring&quot; suburbs.

In the 1920s [[Chicago]] gangster activity came north to Milwaukee during the [[Prohibition era]]. [[Al Capone]], noted Chicago mobster, owned a home in the Milwaukee suburb [[Brookfield, Wisconsin|Brookfield]], where [[moonshine]] was made. The house still stands on a street named after Capone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.brookfieldnow.com/news/102435199.html |date=2010-11-11 |title=It's everyday life that keeps local historian fascinated: But the Hollywood- worthy moments aren't bad, either? |author=Nan Bialek}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1960, Milwaukee had grown to become one of the largest cities in the [[United States of America]].  Its population peaked at 741,324.

By the late 1960s, Milwaukee's population had started to decline due to [[white flight]].  Milwaukee had a population of 636,212 by 1980, while the population of the metropolitan area increased.  Milwaukee avoided the severe declines of its fellow &quot;[[rust belt]]&quot; cities due to its large immigrant population and historic neighborhoods.

Since the 1980s, the city has begun to make strides in improving its economy, [[Neighborhoods of Milwaukee|neighborhoods]], and image, resulting in the revitalization of [[Neighborhoods of Milwaukee|neighborhoods]] such as the [[Historic Third Ward, Milwaukee|Historic Third Ward]], [[Lincoln Village, City of Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Lincoln Village]], the [[East Side, Milwaukee|East Side]], and more recently Walker's Point and [[Bay View, Milwaukee|Bay View]], along with attracting new businesses to its downtown area.  These efforts have substantially slowed the population decline and has stabilized many parts of Milwaukee.

Milwaukee's rich European history is evident today. Largely through its efforts to preserve its history, in 2006 Milwaukee was named one of the &quot;Dozen Distinctive Destinations&quot; by the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;distinctive&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.preservationnation.org/travel-and-sites/sites/midwest-region/milwaukee-wi-2006.html| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100222174953/http://www.preservationnation.org/travel-and-sites/sites/midwest-region/milwaukee-wi-2006.html| archivedate=2010-02-22| title=Dozen Distinctive Destinations - Milwaukee| publisher=[[National Trust for Historic Preservation]]| year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the Census Bureau released revised population numbers for Milwaukee that showed the city gained population, growing by 1.3%, between 2000 and 2009.  This was the first population increase the city of Milwaukee has seen since the [[1960 census]].

Historic Milwaukee walking tours provide a guided tour of Milwaukee's historic districts, including topics on Milwaukee's architectural heritage, its glass skywalk system, and the [[Milwaukee Riverwalk]].

==Geography==
Milwaukee lies along the shores and bluffs of [[Lake Michigan]] at the confluence of three rivers: the [[Menomonee River|Menomonee]], the [[Kinnickinnic River (Milwaukee River)|Kinnickinnic]], and the [[Milwaukee River|Milwaukee]]. Smaller rivers, such as the [[Root River (Wisconsin)|Root River]] and Lincoln Creek, also flow through the city.

Milwaukee's terrain is sculpted by the glacier path and includes steep bluffs along Lake Michigan that begin about a mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) north of downtown. In addition, {{convert|30|mi|km}} southwest of Milwaukee is the Kettle Moraine and lake country that provides an industrial landscape combined with inland lakes.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|96.80|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which, {{convert|96.12|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.68|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gazetteer files&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The City is located overwhelmingly (99.89% of its area) in [[Milwaukee County, Wisconsin|Milwaukee County]], but there are two tiny unpopulated parts of it that extend into neighboring counties. The part in [[Washington County, Wisconsin|Washington County]] is bordered by the southeast corner of [[Germantown, Wisconsin|Germantown]], while the part in [[Waukesha County, Wisconsin|Waukesha County]] is bordered by the southeast corner of [[Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin|Menomonee Falls]], north of the village of [[Butler, Waukesha County, Wisconsin|Butler]].

===Cityscape===
North-south streets are numbered, and east-west streets are named. However, north-south streets east of 1st Street are named, like east-west streets. The north-south numbering line is along the Menomonee River (east of Hawley Road) and Fairview Avenue/Golfview Parkway (west of Hawley Road), with the east-west numbering line defined along 1st Street (north of Oklahoma Avenue) and Chase/Howell Avenue (south of Oklahoma Avenue). This numbering system is also used to the north by [[Mequon, Wisconsin|Mequon]] in [[Ozaukee County, Wisconsin|Ozaukee County]], and by some [[Waukesha County, Wisconsin|Waukesha County]] communities.

Milwaukee is crossed by [[Interstate 43]] and [[Interstate 94]], which come together downtown at the [[Marquette Interchange]]. [[Interstate 894]] bypass runs through portions of the city's southwest side, and [[Interstate 794]] comes out of the Marquette interchange eastbound, bends south along the lakefront and crosses the harbor over the [[Hoan Bridge]], then ends near the [[Bay View, Milwaukee|Bay View]] [[Neighborhoods of Milwaukee|neighborhood]] and becomes the &quot;Lake Parkway&quot; ([[Wisconsin Highway 794|WIS-794]]).

[[File:Milwaukee Wisconsin pano.jpg|thumb|Panoramic view of Downtown Milwaukee at night, grid system visible]]
One of the distinctive traits of Milwaukee's residential areas are the neighborhoods full of so-called [[Polish flat]]s. These are two-[[family]] [[home]]s with separate entrances, but with the units stacked one on top of another instead of side-by-side. This arrangement enables a family of limited means to purchase both a home and a modestly priced [[rental]] [[apartment]] unit. Since [[Polish-American]] immigrants to the area prized land ownership, this solution, which was prominent in their areas of settlement within the city, came to be associated with them.

===Climate===
Milwaukee's location in the [[Great Lakes region (North America)|Great Lakes Region]] often has rapidly changing weather, producing a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Dfa''), with cold, windy, snowy winters, and very warm, humid summers. The warmest month of the year is July, when the 24-hour average is {{convert|71.8|F|1}}, while January is the coldest month, with a 24-hour average of {{convert|22.3|F|1}}. Of the 50 largest cities in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| title=Historical Weather for Milwaukee, Wisconsin

| accessdate=2006-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Milwaukee's proximity to Lake Michigan causes a convection current to form around mid-afternoon in light wind regimes, resulting in the so-called &quot;lake breeze&quot; - a smaller scale version of the more common [[sea breeze]]. The lake breeze is most common between the months of March and July. This onshore flow causes cooler temperatures to move inland usually {{convert|5|to|15|mi|0}}, with much warmer conditions persisting further inland. Residents of the area refer to this phenomenon through the phrase &quot;cooler near the lake&quot;.  Because Milwaukee's official climate site, [[General Mitchell International Airport]], is only {{convert|3|mi}} from the lake, seasonal variations in temperature are less extreme than in many other locations of the [[Milwaukee metropolitan area]].

As the sun sets, the convection current reverses and an offshore flow ensues causing a land breeze. After a land breeze develops, warmer temperatures flow east toward the lakeshore, sometimes causing high temperatures to be reached during the late evening. The lake breeze is not a daily occurrence and will not usually form if a southwest, west, or northwest wind generally exceeds {{convert|15|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. The lake acts to moderate cold air outbreaks along the lakeshore during winter months.

Aside from the lake influence, overnight lows in downtown Milwaukee year-round are often much warmer than suburban locations because of the [[urban heat island effect]]. Onshore winds elevate daytime [[relative humidity]] levels in Milwaukee as compared to inland locations nearby.

Thunderstorms in the region can be dangerous and damaging, bringing [[hail]] and high winds. In rare instances, they can bring a [[tornado]]. However, almost all summer rainfall in the city is brought by these storms. In spring and fall, longer events of prolonged, lighter rain bring most of the precipitation. A moderate snow cover can be seen on or linger for many winter days, but there are many days with less than {{convert|1|in|cm|1}} on the ground.&lt;ref name = NCDC &gt;

===Water===
In the 1990s and 2000s, Lake Michigan experienced large algae blooms. Responding to this problem, in 2009 the city signed on as an Innovating City of the [[Global Compact]] Cities Program. The Milwaukee Water Council was also formed in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thewatercouncil.com/about/overviewhistory/ Who We Are | Milwaukee Water Council]. Thewatercouncil.com.

The strategy used the [[Circles of Sustainability]] method. Instead of treating the water quality problem as confined to a single environmental issue, the Water Council draw on the Circles method to analyze the interconnection between ecological, economic, political and cultural considerations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://citiesprogramme.com/aboutus/our-approach/circles-of-sustainability Circles of Sustainability].

The Milwaukee metropolitan area ranks fifth in the United States in terms of the number of [[Fortune 500]] company headquarters as a share of the population. Milwaukee also has a large number of financial service firms, particularly those specializing in mutual funds and transaction processing systems, and a number of publishing and printing companies.

Service and managerial jobs are the fastest-growing segments of the Milwaukee economy, and [[health care]] alone makes up 27% the jobs in the city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uwm.edu/Course/448-440/employers.html Milwaukee's 10 largest employers]{{Dead link|date=July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Johnson Controls]] Inc., Glendale, placed fourth among motor-vehicle parts firms. Ranked fifth were [[Fiserv]] Inc., Brookfield, in financial data services and [[Kohl’s]] Corp., Menomonee Falls, among general merchandisers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://milwaukee.bizjournals.com/milwaukee/stories/2009/03/23/tidbits2.html |title=Local firms among most admired; Free classes for laid-off workers - The Business Journal of Milwaukee |publisher=Milwaukee.bizjournals.com |date=2009-03-20 |accessdate=2010-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Milwaukee became synonymous with [[Germans]] and [[beer]] beginning in the 1850s. The Germans had long enjoyed beer and set up breweries when they arrived in Milwaukee. By 1856, there were more than two dozen breweries in Milwaukee, most of them German-owned and -operated. Besides making beer for the rest of the nation, Milwaukeeans enjoyed consuming the various beers produced in the city's breweries. As early as 1843, pioneer historian [[James Buck]] recorded 138 taverns in Milwaukee, an average of one per forty residents. Today, [[Beer hall]]s and taverns are abundant in the city, although only one of the major breweries—[[Miller Brewing Company|Miller]]—remains in Milwaukee.&lt;ref name=&quot;milwaukeehistory.net&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.milwaukeehistory.net/milwaukee_timeline/1800s.html |title=Milwaukee County Historical Society - Milwaukee Timeline 1800s |publisher=Milwaukeehistory.net |date= |accessdate=2010-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Milwaukee's founding fathers had a vision for the city. They knew it was perfectly situated as a port city, a center for collecting and distributing produce. Many of the new [[immigrants]] who were pouring into the new state of [[Wisconsin]] during the middle of the 19th century were wheat farmers. By 1860, Wisconsin was the second ranked [[wheat]]-growing state in the country and Milwaukee shipped more wheat than any place in the world. [[Railroads]] were needed to transport all this grain from the wheat fields of Wisconsin to Milwaukee's [[harbor]]. Improvements in railways at the time made this possible.

There was intense competition for markets with [[Chicago]], and to a lesser degree, with [[Racine, Wisconsin|Racine]] and [[Kenosha]]. Eventually Chicago won out. Due to its superior financial and transposition status, as well as being a hub on major railroad lines throughout the United States, Chicago had a distinct advantage over Milwaukee. Milwaukee did solidify its place as the commercial capital of Wisconsin and an important market in the Midwest.&lt;ref name=&quot;milwaukeehistory.net&quot;/&gt;

Milwaukee was once the home to four of the world's largest beer breweries ([[Joseph Schlitz Brewing Company|Schlitz]], [[Valentin Blatz Brewing Company|Blatz]], [[Pabst Brewing Company|Pabst]], and [[Miller Brewing|Miller]]), and was the number one beer producing city in the world for many years. Despite the decline in its position as the world's leading beer producer after the loss of two of those breweries, its one remaining major brewery, [[Miller Brewing Company]] remains a key employer by employing over 2,200 of the city's workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.millerbrewing.com/images/inthecommunity/pdf/millerWIimpact.pdf| format=PDF|title=Connected to Wisconsin — its people and its economy| publisher=Miller Brewing Company| month=February| year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of Miller's solid position as the second-largest beer-maker in the U.S., the city remains known as a beer town despite there being only one brewery.

The historic Milwaukee Brewery, located in &quot;Miller Valley&quot; at 4000 West State Street, is the oldest still-functioning major brewery in the United States. In July 2008, it was announced that [[Coors Brewing Company|Coors]] beer would be added to the list of beers brewed in Miller Valley. This created additional brewery jobs in Milwaukee, however, the company's world headquarters moved from Milwaukee to [[Chicago]].

Besides Miller and the heavily automated [[Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Company|Leinenkugel's]] brewery in the old [[Valentin Blatz Brewing Company|Blatz]] 10th Street plant, the only other currently operating stand-alone breweries in Milwaukee are Milwaukee Brewing Company, a microbrewery in [[Neighborhoods of Milwaukee#Walker's Point|Walker's Point neighborhood]], and [[Lakefront Brewery, Inc.|Lakefront Brewery]], a [[microbrew]]ery located in Brewers Hill. The suburb of [[Glendale, Wisconsin|Glendale]] is home to [[Sprecher Brewery]], another locally popular microbrew. Various [[brewpub]]s can be found throughout the Milwaukee area, including Milwaukee Ale House and Water Street Brewery.

Three beer brewers with [[Wisconsin]] operations made the 2009 list of the 50 largest beermakers in the [[United States]], based on beer sales volume. Making the latest big-breweries list from Wisconsin is [[MillerCoors]] at No. 2. MillerCoors is a joint venture formed in 2008 by Milwaukee-based Miller Brewing Co. and Golden, Colorado-based [[Molson Coors Brewing Company]]. The [[Joseph Huber Brewing Company|Minhas Craft Brewery]] in [[Monroe, Wisconsin]] which brews Huber, Rhinelander and Mountain Crest brands, ranked No. 14 and [[New Glarus Brewing Company]]., [[New Glarus, Wisconsin]] whose brands include Spotted Cow, Fat Squirrel and Uff-da, ranked No. 32.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://milwaukee.bizjournals.com/milwaukee/stories/2009/04/13/daily23.html |title=Three state breweries make largest list - The Business Journal of Milwaukee |publisher=Milwaukee.bizjournals.com |date=2009-04-14 |accessdate=2010-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Happy Days]]'' and ''[[Laverne and Shirley]]'', two [[sitcoms]] that aired on ABC in the 1970s and 1980s, were set in Milwaukee, and often used the Milwaukee breweries as a backdrop for the storyline.

[[File:Menomonee Valley.jpg|thumb|[[Rail tracks]] along the industrial [[Menomonee Valley]], ancestral home of the [[Menominee]] Indians]]
Because of its easy access to [[Lake Michigan]] and other waterways, Milwaukee's [[Menomonee Valley]] has historically been home to [[manufacturing]], [[Meat packing industry|stockyards]], [[Rendering (food processing)|rendering plants]], [[shipping]], and other [[heavy industry]].

Reshaping of the valley began with the [[rail transport|railroads]] built by city co-founder [[Byron Kilbourn]] to bring product from Wisconsin's farm interior to the port. By 1862 Milwaukee was the largest shipper of [[wheat]] on the planet, and related industry developed. [[Grain elevator]]s were built and, due to Milwaukee's dominant [[German American|German immigrant population]], [[Brewery|breweries]] sprang up around the processing of [[barley]] and [[hops]]. A number of [[Tanning|tanneries]] were constructed, of which the Pfister &amp; Vogel tannery grew to become the largest in America.

In 1843 George Burnham and his brother Jonathan opened a [[brickyard]] near 16th Street. When a durable and distinct cream-colored brick came out of the clay beds, other brickyards sprang up to take advantage of this resource. Because many of the city's buildings were built using this material it earned the nickname &quot;Cream City&quot;, and consequently the brick was called [[Cream City brick]]. By 1881 the Burnham brickyard, which employed 200 men and peaked at 15 million bricks a year, was the largest in the world.

[[Gristmill|Flour mills]], packing plants, breweries, railways and tanneries further industrialized the valley. With the [[marsh]]lands drained and the [[Kinnickinnic River (Milwaukee River)|Kinnickinnic]] and [[Milwaukee River]]s dredged, attention turned to the valley.

Along with the processing industries, bulk commodity storage and machining and manufacturing entered the scene. The valley was home to the [[Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad|Milwaukee Road]], [[Falk Corporation]], [[Cutler-Hammer]], Harnischfeger, Chain Belt Company, Nordberg and other industry giants.

Early in the 20th century, Milwaukee was home to several pioneer [[brass era]] [[automobile]] makers, including Ogren (from 1919 to 1922).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Clymer |first=Floyd |title=Treasury of Early American Automobiles, 1877–1925 |location=New York |publisher=Bonanza Books |year=1950 |page=153 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, three Milwaukee-area companies were among nine firms honored for manufacturing excellence in the Wisconsin Manufacturer of the Year competition. [[Astronautics Corporation of America]] and [[Brady Corporation]], both of which have headquarters in Milwaukee, and Wisconsin Plating Works Inc., Racine, each received special awards. Privately held Astronautics, a major supplier of government and commercial avionics, was honored for its high-technology research and development program. Brady, a publicly owned manufacturer of signs, labels and other identification and security products, received an award for corporate excellence. Privately owned Wisconsin Plating Works, which provides metal finishing services, received an award for employee and environmental stewardship. Nominated companies were evaluated in areas such as financial growth or consistency, technological advances, product development, environmental solutions, operational excellence/continuous improvement, commitment to employees, and effective research and development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://milwaukee.bizjournals.com/milwaukee/stories/2007/03/05/story11.html |title=Milwaukee firms win manufacturing excellence awards - The Business Journal of Milwaukee |publisher=Milwaukee.bizjournals.com |date=2007-03-02 |accessdate=2010-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, a group of elected officials and business leaders is trying to entice Boston-Power Inc., a Massachusetts-based battery maker, to open a factory in Milwaukee. Milwaukee Alderman [[Tony Zielinski]] has introduced a resolution to have the city of Milwaukee appropriate from $1 million to $20 million for a factory for Boston-Power, the [[Westborough]], Mass.-based manufacturer of lithium-ion batteries for laptop computers, personal digital assistants, mobile telephones and other portable devices. Stimulus package funds are included in the $787 billion stimulus package signed by President [[Barack Obama]] for lithium-ion battery development, he said. Boston-Power’s interest in locating a plant in Milwaukee stems in part from the area’s manufacturing heritage and that it’s home to [[Johnson Controls]] Inc., the manufacturer has been developing lithium-ion batteries for [[hybrid electric vehicle]]s, plug-in hybrid-electric vehicles and electric vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://milwaukee.bizjournals.com/milwaukee/stories/2009/03/16/story1.html |title=Milwaukee eyed for new factory - The Business Journal of Milwaukee |publisher=Milwaukee.bizjournals.com |date=2009-03-13 |accessdate=2010-07-02 |first=Rich |last=Rovito}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, a non-peer reviewed study was conducted by hired researchers at the [[University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee]] which claimed that Milwaukee is not &quot;hypersegregated&quot; and instead ranks as the 43rd most integrated city in America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=109872 JSonline.com]{{Dead link|date=July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, according to an article by Daniel Denvir at www.salon.org, John Paul Dewitt of censusscope.org and the University of Michigan's Social Science Data Analysis Network looks at census data and finds Milwaukee to be the most segregated urban area in the US.&lt;ref name=&quot;hypersegregation refreshed&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.salon.com/news/politics/war_room/2011/03/29/most_segregated_cities/index.html| publisher=www.salon.com| title=The 10 most segregated urban areas in America| date=March 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through continued dialogue between Milwaukee's citizens, the city is making an effort to reduce racial tensions and reduce the rate of segregation.&lt;ref name=&quot;segregation&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.uwm.edu/Dept/CED/pdf/fairhousing.pdf| publisher=The Metropolitan Milwaukee Fair Housing Council| format=PDF| last=Levine| first=Marc V.| title=Citizens and MMFHC Respond to Milwaukee Journal Sentinel Article: Getting the Facts Right on Segregation in Milwaukee| work=Fair Housing Keys|date=May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; With demographic changes in the wake of [[white flight]], segregation in metropolitan Milwaukee is primarily in the suburbs rather than the city as in the era of [[James Groppi|Father Groppi]].&lt;ref name=&quot;integration&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.uwm.edu/Dept/ETI/integration/integration.htm| publisher=University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee Employment and Training Institute| last=Pawasarat| first=John| title=Racial Integration in Urban America: A Block Level Analysis of African American and White Housing Patterns|month=January | year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;QuinnCensus&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.uwm.edu/Dept/ETI/integration/QuinnCensus.pdf| publisher=University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee Employment and Training Institute| format=PDF| last=Quinn| first=Lois M.| title=Assumptions and Limitations of the Census Bureau Methodology Ranking Racial and Ethnic Residential Segregation in Cities and Metro Areas|month=October | year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
[[File:Basilica of St. Josaphat.jpg|thumb|left|[[St. Josaphat Basilica]], in Milwaukee's historic [[Neighborhoods of Milwaukee#Lincoln Village|Lincoln Village]].]]
The Association of Religion Data Archives reported on the religious composition of the Milwaukee-Racine area as of 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.thearda.com/mapsReports/reports/metro/5082_2000.asp| title=Metro Area Membership Report: Milwaukee-Racine, WI CMSA| accessdate=2006-11-24| year=2002| publisher=[http://www.thearda.com/ Association of Religion Data Archives]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 55% of residents were adherents to one of the 188 groups included in the data.

Of them, 58% were [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]], 23% [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]], 3% [[Methodism|Methodist]], and 2.5% [[Judaism|Jewish]]. &quot;Others&quot; included adherents to other [[Protestantism|Protestant]] denominations, Orthodox churches, paganism and Eastern religions. Historically African-American denominations were not included in the data.

Milwaukee is home to the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milwaukee]], and the [[Episcopal Diocese of Milwaukee]]. The [[School Sisters of the Third Order of St Francis]] have their mother house in Milwaukee, and several other religious orders have a significant presence in the area, including the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] and [[Franciscan]]s. Milwaukee, where [[Joseph Kentenich|Father Josef Kentenich]] was exiled for 14 years from 1952–1965, is also the center for the [[Schoenstatt Movement]] in the United States. [[St. Joan of Arc Chapel]], the oldest church in Milwaukee, is located on the [[Marquette University]] campus. [[St. Josaphat Basilica]] was the first church to be given the Basilica honor in Wisconsin and the third in the United States. [[Holy Hill National Shrine of Mary, Help of Christians]], located northwest of Milwaukee, in [[Hartford, Wisconsin]], was also made a Basilica in 2006.

Milwaukee is home for several [[Lutheran Church]] Synods, including The [[Greater Milwaukee Synod]] of the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]]; the [[Lutheran Church Missouri Synod]] (LCMS), which operates Concordia University in [[Mequon, Wisconsin|Mequon]] and [[Milwaukee Lutheran High School]], the oldest Lutheran high school in the nation; and the [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]] (WELS), which was founded in 1850 in Milwaukee and maintains its national headquarters there.

[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] has a presence in the Milwaukee area.  The Milwaukee area has two stakes, with fourteen wards and four branches among them.

Numerous [[mosques]], [[synagogues]], and [[temple]]s serve Milwaukee's [[Muslim]], Jewish, [[Hindu]], [[Sikh]], [[Unitarian Universalist]], and [[Buddhist]] communities.

==Government and politics==
{{Main|Government of Milwaukee}}
Milwaukee has a [[mayor-council]] form of government.  With the election of Mayor Jon O. Norquist in 1988, the city adopted a cabinet form of government with the mayor appointing those department heads not otherwise elected or appointed—notably the Fire and Police Chiefs.  While this gave the mayor greater control of the day-to-day operations of the city, the Common Council retains almost complete control over the city's finances and the mayor, with the exception of his proposed annual budget, cannot directly introduce legislation.  The Common Council consists of elected members, each representing one of 15 districts in the city. Milwaukee has a history of giving long tenures to its mayors; from [[Frank Zeidler]] to [[Tom Barrett (politician)|Tom Barrett]], the city has had only four mayors in the last 60 years. When 28-year incumbent [[Henry Maier]] retired in 1988, he held the record for longest term of service for a city of Milwaukee's size.

Milwaukee has been a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] stronghold for more than a century, with Democrats dominating every level of government, except for its [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist]] mayors and (for briefer periods) other city and county offices. The city is split between four state Senate districts, each of which is composed of three Assembly districts. All 12 of the officials representing the city in the State Legislature are Democrats. In 2008, [[Barack Obama]] won Milwaukee with 77% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;http://county.milwaukee.gov/ImageLibrary/Groups/cntyElectCommission/ElectionResults/2008/11408_Canvass_Pres___Vice_Pres.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Milwaukee makes up the overwhelming majority of [[Wisconsin's 4th congressional district]]. The district is heavily Democratic. The Democratic primary for the seat is considered more important than the general election.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=256664 Editorial, &quot;4th Congressional District: Moore, Hoze in primaries,&quot; ''Milwaukee Journal Sentinel''; September 4, 2004]{{Dead link|date=July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The district is currently represented by Democrat [[Gwen Moore]].

[[Tim Carpenter]] (D), [[Lena Taylor]] (D), [[Leah Vukmir]] (R), [[Nikiya Harris]] (D), [[Chris Larson]] (D), [[Alberta Darling]] (R), and [[Mary Lazich]] (R) represent Milwaukee in the [[Wisconsin State Senate]], and [[Daniel Riemer]] (D), [[JoCasta Zamarripa]] (D), [[Josh Zepnick]] (D), [[Sandy Pasch]] (D), [[Mandela Barnes]] (D), [[Frederick P. Kessler]] (D), [[Rob Hutton]] (R), [[Dale P. Kooyenga]] (R), [[Leon Young]] (D), [[La Tonya Johnson]] (D), [[Evan Goyke]] (D), [[Jon Richards (politician)|Jon Richards]] (D), [[Christine Sinicki]] (D), [[Don Pridemore]] (R), and [[Mike Kuglitsch]] (R) represent Milwaukee in the [[Wisconsin State Assembly]].

In addition to the election of a Mayor and Common Council on the city level, Milwaukee residents elect county representatives to the [[Milwaukee County]] [[Board of Supervisors]], as well as a Milwaukee County Executive. The current [[County Executive]] is [[Chris Abele]].

===Crime===
For several years, Milwaukee ranked among the ten most dangerous large cities in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g, [http://www.morganquitno.com/cit01pop.htm Violent crime rankings, 2001] Milwaukee is ranked seventh among large cities&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.morganquitno.com/cit07pop.htm#25 |title=Top 25 most dangerous cities, 2007 |publisher=Morganquitno.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its improvement since then, Milwaukee still fares worse when comparing specific crime types to the national average (e.g., homicide, rape, robbery); only aggravated assaults occur less frequently in Milwaukee than the national average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityrating.com/citycrime.asp?city=Milwaukee&amp;state=WI |title=Milwaukee Crime Report |publisher=Cityrating.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.jsonline.com/News/HomicideTracker/ |title=Up to date Journal Sentinel Homicide Tracker Website |publisher=Data.jsonline.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Milwaukee Police Department’s Gang Unit was reactivated in 2004 after Nannette Hegerty was sworn in as chief. In 2006 alone, some 4,000 charges were brought against suspects through Milwaukee’s Gang Unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.milwaukeemagazine.com/currentIssue/full_feature_story.asp?NewMessageID=11745 |title=Gang Wars - Features |publisher=Milwaukee Magazine |date= |accessdate=2010-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
[[File:Rough waters lake michigan with milwaukee at horizon.jpg|thumb|Milwaukee's skyline visible from a sailboat out on [[Lake Michigan]]]]
Milwaukee is a popular venue for [[Lake Michigan]] sailing, windsurfing, kitesurfing, ethnic dining, and cultural festivals. Often referred to as the City of Festivals, Milwaukee has various cultural events which take place throughout the summer at Maier Festival Park, on the lake. Museums and cultural events, such as Jazz in the Park, occur weekly in downtown parks. A 2011 study by [[Walk Score]] ranked Milwaukee 15th most walkable of fifty largest U.S. cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.walkscore.com/rankings/cities/|title=2011 City and Neighborhood Rankings |publisher=Walk Score |year=2011 |accessdate=August 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===City of Festivals===
[[Image:Summerfest Pabst Showcase 1994.jpg|thumb|Henry Maier Festival Grounds during [[Summerfest]]]]
While Milwaukee had been previously marketed as &quot;A Genuine American City&quot; as well as &quot;A Great Place on a [[Lake Michigan|Great Lake]],&quot; it has earned the nickname, the &quot;City of Festivals.&quot;

The city hosts the [[Wisconsin State Fair]], as well as an annual lakefront fair called [[Summerfest]]. Listed in the ''1999 [[Guinness Book of Records|Guinness Book of World Records]]'' as the largest [[music festival]] in the world, for the last several years Summerfest has attracted around a million visitors each year to its eleven stages.

Milwaukee is home to a variety of primarily ethnically themed festivals throughout the summer. Held generally on the lakefront Summerfest grounds, these festivals span several days (typically Friday plus the weekend) and celebrate Milwaukee's history and diversity. In 2008 Riversplash, which markets itself as 'the official opening of summer', kicks off festival season on the last weekend of May. Festivals for the [[LGBT]] ([[PrideFest (Milwaukee)|PrideFest]]) and [[Polish-Americans|Polish]] ([[Polish Fest]]) communities follow in June. Summerfest spans 11 days at the end of June and beginning of July. Milwaukee hosts the [[Great Circus Parade]] in July. In 1960, the [[Shamrock Club of Wisconsin]] was started in Milwaukee with chapters in other parts of the state. There are [[French-Americans|French]] (Bastille Days), [[Greek-Americans|Greek]], [[Italian-Americans|Italian]] ([[Festa Italiana]]) and [[German-Americans|German]] ([[German Fest]]) festivals in July. The [[African-Americans|African]], [[Arab-Americans|Arab]], [[Irish-Americans|Irish]], [[Mexican-Americans|Mexican]], and [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] events wrap it up from August through September.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.milwaukee.org/docs/2008_Major_Events.pdf 2008 Major Events Calendar]{{Dead link|date=July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Milwaukee is also home to [[Trainfest (Milwaukee)|Trainfest]], the largest operating model railroad show in America, in November.

Amtrak operates its [[Empire Builder]] passenger train daily between [[Chicago]] and the [[Pacific Northwest]], with stops near [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]], [[Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin|Wisconsin Dells]] and [[Minneapolis]]. In 2010, $800 million in federal funds were allocated to the creation of high speed rail links from Milwaukee to Chicago and Madison;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Held |first=Tom |url=http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/82864412.html |title=Wisconsin lands $800 million for high-speed rail |publisher=JSOnline |date=2010-01-28 |accessdate=2010-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the funds were eventually rejected by newly elected [[List of Governors of Wisconsin|Wisconsin Governor]] [[Scott Walker (politician)|Scott Walker]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://lacrossetribune.com/news/local/walker-defends-rejecting-fed-funds-for-passenger-rail/article_d3fb1326-1e2d-11e1-a602-001871e3ce6c.html#ixzz1lAqhmFlX Hubbuch, Chris. &quot;Walker defends rejecting fed funds for passenger rail&quot; ''[[La Crosse Tribune]]'' December 4, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, [[Wisconsin]] Gov. [[Jim Doyle]], with seven other governors of Midwestern states and then-[[Chicago]] Mayor [[Richard M. Daley]], joined in bipartisan support of a high-speed rail network that would link cities around the region. Milwaukee would be connected to [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]] and Chicago as part of the first phase of the system. “[[Barack Obama|President Obama]]’s vision of making high-speed rail a part of our nation’s future transportation network holds great promise”, Doyle and co-signers wrote in a letter to U.S. Department of Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood. “We recognize that a high-speed rail network has the potential to reduce highway and airway congestion, greenhouse gas emissions and the nation’s dependence on foreign oil.” Governors Pat Quinn of [[Illinois]], Jay Nixon of [[Missouri]], Mitch Daniels of [[Indiana]], Chet Culver of [[Iowa]], Jennifer Granholm of [[Michigan]], Ted Strickland of [[Ohio]] and Tim Pawlenty of [[Minnesota]] were co-signers of the letter. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds and mandates high-speed passenger rail and the Midwestern network would include {{convert|3000|mi}} of existing rights of way to connect cities with trains capable of at least {{convert|110|mph}}. Chicago would serve as the hub, just as it does for freight. The rail network would link large and small metropolitan areas, airports, bus stations and highways.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://milwaukee.bizjournals.com/milwaukee/stories/2009/04/13/daily14.html?surround=lfn |title=Governors unite for high-speed rail - The Business Journal of Milwaukee |publisher=Milwaukee.bizjournals.com |date=2009-04-13 |accessdate=2010-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Obama administration announced $823 million in federal stimulus spending to build high-speed rail for the southern half of Wisconsin. The rail line connecting Milwaukee and Madison, which Governor Jim Doyle touted as revolutionary, would have started out at roughly {{convert|79|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} when it would have begun in 2013 and would not have reached its top speed of {{convert|110|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} for at least several years. The state's application for the federal funds put the acceleration in 2016, when the line was expected to expand to the [[Twin Cities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Held |first=Tom |url=http://www.jsonline.com/newswatch/83000147.html |title=Doyle, mayors laud high-speed rail plan |publisher=JSOnline |date=2010-01-28 |accessdate=2010-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2011, the project was ended by Doyle's successor, [[Scott Walker (politician)|Scott Walker]].

===Commuter transit===
The [[Badger Bus]] and station in downtown Milwaukee provides bus service between Milwaukee and [[Madison, Wisconsin]]. Stops include the [[Memorial Union (Wisconsin)|UW–Madison Memorial Union]], Madison Bus Depot, [[Johnson Creek, Wisconsin|Johnson Creek]], Goerkes Corners, Milwaukee 84th St, Milwaukee Bus Depot (downtown Milwaukee), and [[Milwaukee Airport]].  The [[Milwaukee County Transit System]] provides bus services within Milwaukee County. The renovated [[Milwaukee Intermodal Station]] provides [[Jefferson Lines]] intercity bus riders access to [[Amtrak]] and [[Greyhound Lines]].

A tram system known as the Milwaukee Connector was proposed and passed by the Common Council, but Mayor [[Tom Barrett (politician)|Tom Barrett]] vetoed the bill because of problems of cost and availability. A modern streetcar is now planned to connect the Milwaukee Intermodal Station, downtown Milwaukee, and Ogden Ave.  The project is projected to cost $64.6 million and open in the summer of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themilwaukeestreetcar.com |title=Introduction |publisher=Milwaukee Streetcar |date= |accessdate=2012-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 0.5% sales tax was proposed for the counties of [[Milwaukee County|Milwaukee]], [[Racine County, Wisconsin|Racine]], and [[Kenosha County, Wisconsin|Kenosha]] by the Southeast Wisconsin Regional Transit Authority to fund the KRM (Kenosha-Racine-Milwaukee) Commuter Rail project serving those cities as well as several other stops on the route.  A connection to [[Metra]] commuter rail in Kenosha was planned with some trains continuing to Chicago.  In Milwaukee, the line was to terminate at the Milwaukee Intermodal Station.  In June 2011, authorizing legislation for regional transit authorities in Wisconsin was repealed, leading to the dissolution of the Southeastern Regional Transit Authority, which was leading the commuter rail planning.  The project is currently on indefinite hold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maps.sewrpc.org/KRMonline/ |title=KRMonline - Home |publisher=Maps.sewrpc.org |date=2009-10-05 |accessdate=2012-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freeways===
[[File:Hoan Bridge.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Hoan Bridge]]]]
Two of Wisconsin's [[Interstate highway]]s intersect in Milwaukee. [[Interstate 94]] comes north from Chicago to enter Milwaukee and continues west to [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]]. [[Interstate 43]] enters Milwaukee from the southwest and continues north to [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]]. Milwaukee has two branch interstate highways, [[Interstate 894]] and [[Interstate 794]]. I-894 extends from the western suburbs to the southern suburbs, bypassing downtown. I-794 extends east from the [[Marquette Interchange]] to Lake Michigan before turning south over the [[Hoan Bridge]] toward the [[General Mitchell International Airport|airport]], turning into [[Highway 794 (Wisconsin)|Highway 794]] along the way. Milwaukee is also served by three [[United States Numbered Highways|US highways]]. [[U.S. Route 18]] provides a link from downtown to points west. [[U.S. Route 41]] and [[U.S. Route 45]] both provide north-south freeway transportation on the western side of the city.

In 2010, the Milwaukee area was ranked the 4th best city for commuters by [[Forbes (magazine)|''Forbes'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.forbes.com/2010/02/12/best-worst-commutes-lifestyle-mass-transit_chart.html?partner=msnlocal |title=Best And Worst Cities For Commuters |publisher=Forbes.com |date= 2010-02-16|accessdate=2010-07-02 |first=Francesca |last=Levy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bicycle===
[[File:Oak leaf trail milwaukee.jpg|thumb|The [[Oak Leaf Trail]] on the [[East Side, Milwaukee|East Side]]]]
Milwaukee has over {{convert|65|mi|km}} of bicycle lanes and trails, most of which run alongside or near its rivers and [[Lake Michigan]]. The [[Oak Leaf Trail]], a multi-use recreational trail, provides bicycle trails throughout the city and county. Still pending are the creation of bicycle lanes along major commuting routes, such as the [[Hoan Bridge]] connector between downtown and the suburbs to the south. The city has also identified over {{convert|250|mi|km}} of streets on which bike lanes will fit. It has created a plan labeling {{convert|145|mi|km}} of those as high priority for receiving bike lanes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.city.milwaukee.gov/BikeLanesandBikeRout14143.htm |title=Bike Lanes and Bike Routes |accessdate=2008-03-22 |author=City of Milwaukee}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the city's Bicycle and Pedestrian Task Force's mission to &quot;make Milwaukee more bicycle and pedestrian friendly&quot;, over 700 bike racks have been installed throughout the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.city.milwaukee.gov/BicycleTaskForce3727.htm |title=Bicycle and Pedestrian Task Force |accessdate=2008-03-22 |author=City of Milwaukee}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bicycle Federation of Wisconsin&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bfw.org bfw.org]&lt;/ref&gt; holds an annual Bike to Work Week. The event, held in May each year, has frequently featured a commuter race between a car, a bus, and a bike; and also a morning ride into work with the mayor. In 2006, Milwaukee obtained bronze-level status from the League of American Bicyclists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bicyclefriendlycommunity.org/AllBicycleFriendlyCommunities.htm |title=League of American Bicyclists * Bicycle Friendly Community Campaign |publisher=bicyclefriendlycommunity.org |date= |accessdate=2010-07-02}} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  a rarity for a city its size.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.silentsports.net/madison_makes_sense.html ]{{Dead link|date=July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting on June 4, 2009, the [[Milwaukee County Transit System]] has begun installing bicycle racks to the front of county buses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ridemcts.com/riding_the_bus/index.asp?id=1276 ]{{Dead link|date=July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This &quot;[[Environmental movement|green]]&quot; effort has been done, in part, with hopes of settling an [[asbestos]] lawsuit leveled by the [[Wisconsin|state]] at the [[Milwaukee County|county]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=715962 County hopes bike racks on buses cancel out asbestos - Plan may settle environmental lawsuit by state] ''[[Milwaukee Journal]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The lawsuit cites the release of asbestos into the environment when the [[Milwaukee County Courthouse|Courthouse Annex]] was demolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.onmilwaukee.com/politics/articles/hissom021308.html |title=Rack and Roll |publisher= Onmilwaukee.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Madison''' is the [[Capital city|capital]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Wisconsin]] and the [[county seat]] of [[Dane County, Wisconsin|Dane County]]. As of July 1, 2012, Madison had an estimated population of 240,323,{{GR|2}} making it the second largest city in Wisconsin, after [[Milwaukee]], and the [[List of United States cities by population|81st largest]] in the United States. The city forms the core of the [[United States Census Bureau]]'s [[Madison, Wisconsin metropolitan area|Madison Metropolitan Statistical Area]], which includes all of Dane County and neighboring [[Iowa County, Wisconsin|Iowa]] and [[Columbia County, Wisconsin|Columbia]] counties. The Madison [[Metropolitan Statistical Area]] had a 2010 population of 568,593.

==History==
[[File:madison 1855.jpg|thumb|250px|right|View of Madison. From the Water Cure, South Side of Lake Monona, 1855.]]
[[File:Madison WI Barber 1865p439cropped.jpg|250px|thumb|right|View of downtown and Capitol from Washington Street, 1865.]]
Madison's origins begin in 1829, when former federal judge [[James Duane Doty]] purchased over a thousand acres (4&amp;nbsp;km²) of swamp and forest land on the isthmus between Lakes Mendota and Monona, with the intention of building a city in the Four Lakes region. When the [[Wisconsin Territory]] was created in 1836 the territorial legislature convened in [[Belmont, Wisconsin]]. One of the legislature's tasks was to select a permanent location for the territory's capital. Doty lobbied aggressively for Madison as the new capital, offering [[American bison|buffalo]] robes to the freezing legislators and promising choice Madison lots at discount prices to undecided voters{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}. He had [[James Slaughter]] [[plat]] two cities in the area, Madison and &quot;The City of Four Lakes&quot;, near present-day [[Middleton, Wisconsin|Middleton]]. Doty named the city Madison for [[James Madison]], the fourth President of the U.S. who had died on June 28, 1836 and he named the streets for the other 39 signers of the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;Historic Madison, Inc., [http://www.historicmadison.org/Madison%27s%20Past/madisonspast.html Madison's Past - Early History]&lt;/ref&gt; Although the city existed only on paper, the territorial legislature voted on November 28 in favor of Madison as its capital, largely because of its location halfway between the new and growing cities around [[Milwaukee]] in the east and the long established strategic post of [[Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin|Prairie du Chien]] in the west, and between the highly populated [[lead]] mining regions in the southwest and Wisconsin's oldest city, [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]] in the northeast. Being named for the much-admired [[Founding Fathers of the United States|founding father]] [[James Madison]], who had just died, and having streets named for each of the [[Philadelphia Convention|39 signers]] of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]], may have also helped attract votes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wicourts.gov/about/organization/supreme/hearingroom.htm WiC-hear], WiCourts.gov.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creation and expansion===
The cornerstone for the Wisconsin capitol was laid in 1837, and the legislature first met there in 1838.  On October 9, 1839, [[Kintzing Prichette|Kintzing Prichett]] registered the [[plat]] of Madison at the registrar's office of the then-territorial [[Dane County, Wisconsin|Dane County]].&lt;ref name=&quot;platted1839&quot;&gt;{{cite book| title= Reports of cases argued and determined in the Supreme Court of the State of Wisconsin| volume= 6 | publisher= E.E. Hale &amp; Co. | location= Beloit| year= 1858 |page= 215 | chapter= Vilas vs. Reynolds| url= http://books.google.com/books?id=Qf4aAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA215 | accessdate= 2011-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Madison was incorporated as a village in 1846, with a population of 626. When Wisconsin became a state in 1848, Madison remained the capital, and the following year it became the site of the University of Wisconsin (now [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]). The [[Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad|Milwaukee &amp; Mississippi Railroad]] (a predecessor of the [[Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad|Milwaukee Road]]) connected to Madison in 1854. Madison incorporated as a city in 1856, with a population of 6,863, leaving the unincorporated remainder as a separate [[Madison (town), Wisconsin|Town of Madison]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/WI/WI-idx?type=header;pview=hide;id=WI.MadDane  ''Madison, Dane County and Surrounding Towns''], Madison: Wm. J. Park, 1877, pp. 543–558.&lt;/ref&gt; The original capitol was replaced in 1863 and the second capitol burned in 1904. The current capitol was built between 1906 and 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.wisconsin.gov/state/core/wisconsin_state_capitol_tour.html | title=Wisconsin State Capitol Tour | publisher=State of Wisconsin |accessdate=2007-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Madison served as a center of the [[Union Army]] in Wisconsin. The intersection of Milwaukee, East Washington, Winnebago and North Streets is known as Union Corners, because a tavern located there was the last stop for Union soldiers before heading to fight the Confederates. Camp Randall, on the west side of Madison, was built and used as a training camp, a military hospital, and a prison camp for captured [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] soldiers. After the war ended, the Camp Randall site was absorbed into the University of Wisconsin and [[Camp Randall Stadium]] was built there in 1917. In 2004 the last vestige of active military training on the site was removed when the stadium renovation replaced a firing range used for [[ROTC]] training.

The City of Madison continued annexations from the Town of Madison almost from the date of the city's incorporation, leaving the latter a collection of discontinuous areas subject to annexation. In the wake of continued controversy and an effort in the state legislature to simply abolish the town, an agreement was reached in 2003 to provide for the incorporation of the remaining portions of the Town into the City of Madison and the [[Fitchburg, Wisconsin|City of Fitchburg]] by October 30, 2022.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=ftp://doaftp04.doa.state.wi.us/doadocs/Madison-Madison-FitchburgAgreement.pdf | title=2003 City of Madison, City of Fitchburg and Town of Madison Cooperative Plan |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Madison is located in the center of Dane County in south-central Wisconsin, {{convert|77|mi|km|0}} west of [[Milwaukee]] and {{convert|122|mi|km|0}} northwest of [[Chicago]]. The city completely surrounds the smaller [[Madison (town), Wisconsin|Town of Madison]], the City of [[Monona, Wisconsin|Monona]], and the [[Village (Wisconsin)|villages]] of [[Maple Bluff, Wisconsin|Maple Bluff]] and [[Shorewood Hills, Wisconsin|Shorewood Hills]]. Madison shares borders with its largest suburb, [[Sun Prairie, Wisconsin|Sun Prairie]], and three other communities, [[Middleton, Wisconsin|Middleton]], [[McFarland, Wisconsin|McFarland]] and [[Fitchburg, Wisconsin|Fitchburg]]. The city's boundaries also approach the villages of [[Verona, Wisconsin|Verona]], [[Cottage Grove, Wisconsin|Cottage Grove]], [[DeForest, Wisconsin|DeForest]], and [[Waunakee, Wisconsin|Waunakee]].

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|94.03|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which, {{convert|76.79|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|17.24|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.&lt;ref name =&quot;Gazetteer files&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city is sometimes described as ''The City of Four Lakes'', comprising the four successive lakes of the [[Yahara River]]: [[Lake Mendota]] (&quot;Fourth Lake&quot;), [[Lake Monona]] (&quot;Third Lake&quot;), [[Lake Waubesa]] (&quot;Second Lake&quot;) and [[Lake Kegonsa]] (&quot;First Lake&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&amp;term_id=9293&amp;term_type_id=2&amp;term_type_text=Places&amp;letter=F|title=Dictionary of Wisconsin History: Four Lakes|publisher=[[Wisconsin Historical Society]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; although Waubesa and Kegonsa are not actually in Madison, but just south of it. A fifth smaller lake, [[Lake Wingra]], is within the city as well; it is connected to the Yahara River chain by Wingra Creek. The Yahara flows into the [[Rock River (Illinois)|Rock River]], which in turn, flows into the [[Mississippi River]]. Downtown Madison is located on an [[Madison Isthmus|isthmus]] between Lakes Mendota and Monona. The city's trademark of &quot;Lake, City, Lake&quot; reflects this geography.

Local identity varies throughout Madison, with over 120 officially recognized neighborhood associations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofmadison.com/residents/Community/index.cfm|title=City of Madison Website, Communities and Neighborhoods}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neighborhoods on and near the eastern part of the isthmus, some of the city's oldest, have the strongest sense of identity and are the most politically liberal.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} Historically, the north, east, and south sides were [[blue-collar worker|blue collar]] while the west side was [[white-collar worker|white collar]], and to a certain extent this remains true. Students dominate on the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison|University of Wisconsin]] campus and to the east into downtown, while to its south and in [[Shorewood Hills, Wisconsin|Shorewood Hills]] on its west, faculty have been a major presence since those neighborhoods were originally developed. The turning point in Madison's development was the university's 1954 decision to develop its experimental farm on the western edge of town; since then, the city has grown substantially along suburban lines.

Madison, along with the rest of the state, has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Dfb/Dfa''), characterized by variable weather patterns and a large seasonal temperature variance: winter temperatures can be well below freezing, with moderate to occasionally heavy snowfall and temperatures reaching {{convert|0|°F|0}} on 17 nights annually; high temperatures in summer average in the lower 80s °F (27–28 °C), reaching {{convert|90|°F|0}} on an average 12 days per year,&lt;ref name=NOAA/&gt;&lt;!--{{cite web|url=http://cdo.ncdc.noaa.gov/climatenormals/clim20/wi/474961.pdf|title=NCDC: U.S. Climate Normals|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; often accompanied by high humidity levels. Summer accounts for a greater proportion of annual rainfall, but winter still sees significant precipitation.

====2012 controversy====
The Madison Police Department was criticized for absolving Officer Steve Heimsness of any wrongdoing in the November 2012 shooting death of an unarmed man, Paul Heenan. The department's actions resulted in community protests, including demands that the shooting be examined and reviewed by an independent investigative body.&lt;ref&gt;http://host.madison.com/wsj/news/local/crime_and_courts/madison-rally-calls-for-independent-review-of-fatal-police-shooting/article_0acaf784-5d8b-11e2-b307-001a4bcf887a.html&lt;/ref&gt;  WisconsinWatch.org called into question the MPD's facts and findings, stating that the use of deadly force by Heimsness was unwarranted.&lt;ref&gt;WisconsinWatch.org. [http://www.wisconsinwatch.org/2013/01/06/police-account-of-shooting-disputed &quot;Police account of shooting disputed&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; There were calls for an examination of the Madison Police Department’s rules of engagement and due process for officers who use lethal force in the line of duty.

===Madison Fire Department===
The Madison Fire Department (MFD) provides fire protection and [[emergency medical services]] to the city. The MFD operates out of 12 fire stations, with a fleet of 10 engines, 5 ladders, 2 rescue squads, 2 haz-mat. units, 2 water rescue units, and 9 ambulances. The MFD also provides mutual aid to surrounding communities.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cityofmadison.com/fire/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cityofmadison.com/fire/operations/suppression.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cityofmadison.com/fire/ems.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cityofmadison.com/fire/about/organization.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cityofmadison.com/fire/about/annualReport.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cityofmadison.com/fire/about/history/history.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
[[Image:Wis-capitol.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Wisconsin State Capitol]] atop Madison's [[Madison Isthmus|isthmus]]]]
City voters have supported the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] in national elections in the last half-century, and a liberal and progressive majority is generally elected to the city council. Detractors often refer to Madison as ''The [[People's Republic#Other uses|People's Republic]] of Madison,'' the &quot;Left Coast of Wisconsin&quot; or as &quot;77 square miles surrounded by reality.&quot; This latter phrase was coined by former Wisconsin Republican governor [[Lee S. Dreyfus]], while campaigning in 1978, as recounted by campaign aide Bill Kraus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Surrounded by reality |last=Moe |first=Doug |authorlink=Doug Moe (writer) |year=2005 |publisher=Jones Books |location=Madison |isbn=0976353938 |page=xiii |pages= |accessdate=July 26, 2012 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8EgjAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=dreyfus+78+square+miles+surrounded+by+reality&amp;dq=dreyfus+78+square+miles+surrounded+by+reality&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=E3LcgUapq_&amp;sig=laOz0X2BD2VP6-_n9fb-7z9ZDmQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=SMoQUIXGMILt0gHTkYHgDQ&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, there was a motion in the city council to turn Dreyfus' insult into the official city &quot;punchline,&quot; but it was voted down by the city council.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibmadison.com/In-Business-Madison/July-2013/Madison-to-stay-real-City-Council-rejects-Soglins-proposed-slogan/]&lt;/ref&gt;

The city's voters are generally much more liberal than voters in the rest of Wisconsin. For example, 76% of Madison voters voted against a 2006 state [[Wisconsin Referendum 1 (2006)|constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Fair Wisconsin News Release | url=http://www.fairwisconsin.com | accessdate=2007-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; even though the ban passed statewide with 59% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Key Ballot Measures | publisher=CNN.com | url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2006/pages/results/ballot.measures/ | accessdate=2007-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current politics===
Madison city politics remain dominated by activists of liberal and progressive ideologies. In 1992, a local third party, [[Progressive Dane]], was founded. Recently enacted city policies supported in the Progressive Dane platform have included an [[inclusionary zoning]] ordinance, later abandoned by the mayor and a majority of the city council, and a city minimum wage. The party holds several seats on the Madison City Council and Dane County Board of Supervisors, and is aligned variously with the Democratic and Green parties.

In early 2011, Madison was the site for [[2011 Wisconsin protests|large protests]] against a bill proposed by Governor [[Scott Walker (politician)|Scott Walker]] that abolished almost all collective bargaining for public worker unions. The protests at the capitol ranged in size from 10,000 to over 100,000 people and lasted for several months.

===Historical politics===
In the 1960s and 1970s, the Madison [[counterculture]] was centered in the neighborhood of Mifflin and Bassett streets, referred to as &quot;Miffland&quot;. The area contained many three-story apartments where students and counterculture youth lived, painted murals, and operated the co-operative grocery store, the Mifflin Street Co-op. Residents of the neighborhood often came into conflict with authorities, particularly during the administration of Republican mayor [[William Dyke|Bill Dyke]]. Dyke was viewed by students as a direct antagonist in efforts to protest the [[Vietnam War]] because of his efforts to suppress local protests. The annual [[Mifflin Street Block Party]] became a focal point for protest, although by the late 1970s it had become a mainstream community party.

During the late 1960s and early 1970s, thousands of students and other citizens took part in [[Opposition to the Vietnam War#Growing protests|anti-Vietnam War marches and demonstrations]], with more violent incidents drawing national attention to the city and UW campus. These include:
* the 1967 student protest of [[Dow Chemical Company]], with 74 injured;
* the 1969 strike to secure greater representation and rights for African-American students and faculty, which resulted in the involvement of the Wisconsin [[United States National Guard|Army National Guard]];
* the 1970 fire that caused damage to the Army [[Reserve Officer Training Corps|ROTC]] headquarters housed in the Old Red Gym, also known as the Armory; and
* the 1970 late summer predawn [[ANFO]] bombing of the Army Mathematics Research Center in Sterling Hall, killing a postdoctoral researcher, Robert Fassnacht. ''(See [[Sterling Hall bombing]])''

These protests were the subject of the documentary [[The War at Home (1979 film)|''The War at Home'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/52754/The-War-at-Home/overview | title=The War at Home (1979) Review Summary | publisher=New York Times | accessdate=July 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Maraniss]]'s book, ''[[They Marched into Sunlight]]'', incorporated the 1967 Dow protests into a larger [[Vietnam War]] narrative. Tom Bates wrote the book ''Rads'' on the subject (ISBN 0-06-092428-4). Bates wrote that Dyke's attempt to suppress the annual Mifflin Street block party &quot;would take three days, require hundreds of officers on overtime pay, and engulf the student community from the nearby Southeast Dorms to Langdon Street's fraternity row. [[Tear gas]] hung like heavy fog across the Isthmus.&quot; In the fracas, student activist [[Paul Soglin]], then a city [[alderman]], was arrested twice and taken to [[County jail|jail]]. Soglin was later elected mayor of Madison, serving from 1973 to 1979, 1989 to 1997, and is the current mayor, elected again in April, 2011. During his middle term he led the construction of the Frank Lloyd Wright designed [[Monona Terrace]].

===Political groups and publications===
Madison is home to the [[Freedom from Religion Foundation]], which attempts to influence government in matters relating to the [[separation of church and state]]. The largest national organization advocating for non-theists, FFRF is known for its lawsuits against religious displays on public property, and for advocating removal of &quot;[[In God We Trust]]&quot; from American [[currency]]. The group publishes a monthly newspaper, ''Freethought Today''.

Madison is associated with [[Robert M. La Follette, Sr.|&quot;Fighting Bob&quot; La Follette]] and the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1924)|Progressive movement]]. La Follette's magazine, ''[[The Progressive]]'', founded in 1909, is still published in Madison.

==Religion==
Madison is the [[episcopal see]] for the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Madison]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.madisondiocese.org |title=Roman Catholic Diocese of Madison home page |publisher=Madisondiocese.org |date= |accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saint Raphael's Cathedral, Madison, Wisconsin|Saint Raphael's Cathedral]], damaged by arson in 2005 and demolished in 2008, was the mother church of the diocese.

The USA's third largest congregation of [[Unitarian Universalists]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Walton|first=Christopher|title=What size are Unitarian Universalist congregations?|url=http://uuworld.org/ideas/articles/188538.shtml|publisher=uuworld.org|accessdate=6 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the [[First Unitarian Society of Madison]], makes its home in the historic Unitarian Meeting House, designed by one of its members, [[Frank Lloyd Wright]].

[[InterVarsity Christian Fellowship|InterVarsity Christian Fellowship/USA]] has its headquarter in Madison. The city also has a [[Buddhist]] temple, a [[Hindu]] temple, three [[mosques]] and several [[synagogues]], a [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í]] community center, an [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|LDS]] [[stake (LDS)|stake]], and a [[Unity Church]] congregation. Most American Christian movements are represented in the city including mainline denominations, evangelical, fundamentalist, charismatic and fully independent churches.

==Economy==
Wisconsin state government and the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] remain the two largest Madison employers. However, Madison's economy today is evolving from a government-based economy to a consumer services and high-tech base, particularly in the health, biotech and advertising sectors.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} Beginning in the early 1990s, the city experienced a steady economic boom and has been less affected by recession than other areas of the state. Much of the expansion has occurred on the city's south and west sides, but it has also affected the east side near the Interstate 39-90-94 interchange and along the northern shore of Lake Mendota. Underpinning the boom is the development of high-tech companies, many fostered by UW–Madison working with local businesses and entrepreneurs to transfer the results of academic research into real-world applications, especially bio-tech applications.

Many businesses are attracted to Madison's skill base, taking advantage of the area's high level of education. 48.2% of Madison's population over the age of 25 holds at least a bachelor's degree.&lt;ref&gt;city-data.com&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine reported in 2004 that Madison has the highest percentage of individuals holding Ph.D.s in the United States. In 2006, the same magazine listed Madison as number 31 in the top 200&amp;nbsp;metro areas for &quot;Best Places for Business and Careers.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forbes.com/lists/2006/1/Rank_2.html &quot;Best Places for Business] ''[[Forbes]]'', May 22, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Madison has also been named in ''Forbes'' ten Best Cities several times within the past decade.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} In 2009, in the midst of the [[late-2000s recession]], Madison had an unemployment rate of 3.5% and was ranked number one in a list of &quot;ten cities for job growth&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.forbes.com/2009/01/05/cities-jobs-employment-leadership-careers-cx_tw_0105cities_slide_2.html |title= No. 1: Madison, Wis. |work=10 Cities Where They're Hiring| publisher= [[Forbes]] | date=January 5, 2009| accessdate=2011-07-24 | first=Tara | last=Weiss}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transportation==
Madison is served by the [[Dane County Regional Airport]], which serves more than 100 commercial flights on an average day, and nearly 1.6&amp;nbsp;million passengers annually.  Most major [[general aviation]] operations take place at [[Morey Field]] in [[Middleton, WI|Middleton]] {{convert|15|mi|km|0}} from the city center.

===Railways===
A [[high-speed rail]] route from [[Chicago]] through Milwaukee and Madison to [[Minneapolis/St. Paul, Minnesota]], was proposed as part of the [[Midwest Regional Rail Initiative]]. Funding for the railway connecting Madison to Milwaukee was approved in January, 2010, but Governor-elect Scott Walker's opposition to the project led the [[Federal Railroad Administration]] to retract the $810 million in funding and reallocate it to other projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dot.gov/affairs/2010/dot20810.html |title=Statement From The U.S. Department Of Transportation |publisher=Dot.gov |date=2010-12-09 |accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nearest passenger train station is in [[Columbus, Wisconsin]], {{convert|28|mi|km}} away to the northeast.

Railroad freight services are provided to Madison by [[Wisconsin and Southern Railroad]] (WSOR) and [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] (CP). Wisconsin &amp; Southern has been operating since 1980, having taken over trackage owned since the 19th century by the [[Chicago and North Western Railway|Chicago and North Western]] and the [[Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad|Milwaukee Road]].

The [[Transport 2020]] project proposed a hybrid [[commuter rail]]-[[light rail]] transit line along one of the existing rail corridors from [[Middleton, Wisconsin]] to Reiner Road between Madison and [[Sun Prairie, Wisconsin]], serving the University Avenue corridor, [[University of Wisconsin–Madison|UW-Madison]] campus, the isthmus, and northeast Madison. In June 2008, the project submitted an application with the [[Federal Transit Administration]] to begin preliminary engineering for the project. However, in June 2011, authorizing legislation for regional transit authorities in Wisconsin was repealed and the application was withdrawn. The project is currently on hold.

===Buses===
In addition to public transportation, regional buses connect Madison to [[Milwaukee]], [[Chicago]], [[Minneapolis–Saint Paul]], and many other communities. [[Badger Bus]], which connects Madison and[[Milwaukee]], runs several trips daily. [[Greyhound Lines]], a nationwide bus company, serves Madison on its [[Chicago]], [[Milwaukee]], and [[Minneapolis–Saint Paul]] route. [[Van Galder Bus Company]], a subsidiary of [[Coach USA]], provides transportation through [[Rockford, Illinois|Rockford]] to [[Chicago]] – stopping at [[Union Station (Chicago)|Union Station]], [[O'Hare International Airport|O'Hare Airport]], and [[Chicago Midway International Airport|Midway Airport]].

Madison is home to an extensive and varied number of print publications, reflecting the city's role as the state capital and its diverse political, cultural and academic population. The ''[[Wisconsin State Journal]]'' (weekday circulation: ~95,000; Sundays: ~155,000) is published in the mornings, while its sister publication, ''[[The Capital Times]]'' (Thursday supplement to the Journal) is published online daily, with two printed editions a week. Though jointly operated under the name [[Capital Newspapers]], the ''Journal'' is owned by the national chain [[Lee Enterprises]], and the ''Times'' is independently owned. ''Wisconsin State Journal'' is the descendant of the ''Wisconsin Express'', a paper founded in the Wisconsin Territory in 1839. ''The Capital Times'' was founded in 1917 by William T. Evjue, a business manager for the ''State Journal'' who disagreed with that paper's editorial criticisms of Wisconsin Republican Senator [[Robert M. La Follette, Sr.]] for his opposition to U.S. entry into [[World War I]].

The free weekly alternative newspaper ''[[Isthmus (newspaper)|Isthmus]]'' (weekly circulation: ~65,000) was founded in Madison in 1976. ''[[The Onion]]'', a satirical weekly, was founded in Madison in 1988. Two student newspapers are published during the academic year, ''[[The Daily Cardinal]]'' (Mon-Fri circulation: ~10,000) and ''[[The Badger Herald]]'' (Mon-Fri circulation: ~16,000). Other specialty print publications focus on local music, politics and sports, including ''The Madison Times'', ''Madison Magazine'', ''The Simpson Street Free Press'' and fantasy sports web site [[RotoWire.com]].  There is a strong community of local blogs including [[Ann Althouse|Althouse]], dane101, and [[The Critical Badger]].

''[[The Progressive]]'', published in Madison, is a left-wing periodical that may be best known for the attempt of the U.S. government in 1979 to suppress one of its articles before publication. The magazine eventually prevailed in the landmark First Amendment case, [[United States v. The Progressive, Inc.]] During the 1970s, there were two radical weeklies published in Madison, known as ''TakeOver'' and ''Free for All'', as well as a Madison edition of the ''[[Bugle (newspaper)|Bugle-American]]'' [[underground newspaper]].

Madison hosts two volunteer-operated and community-oriented radio stations, [[WORT]] and [[WSUM]]. WORT Community Radio (89.9 FM), founded in 1975, is one of the oldest volunteer-powered radio stations in the United States. A listener-sponsored community radio station, WORT offers diverse music and talk programming that is locally produced and hosted by local DJs. WSUM (91.7 FM) is a [[student radio]] station whose programming and operation are carried out almost entirely by students.

Madison's [[Wisconsin Public Radio]] station, [[WHA (AM)|WHA]], was one of the first radio stations in the nation to begin broadcasting, and remains the longest continuously broadcasting station in the nation.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Among the city's neighborhood fairs and celebrations are two large student-driven gatherings, the [[Mifflin Street Block Party]] and the [[State Street Halloween Party]]. Rioting and vandalism at the State Street gathering in 2004 and 2005 led the city to institute a cover charge for the 2006 celebration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.madison.com/wsj/mad/top/index.php?ntid=91722&amp;ntpid=1b |title=Madison WI news sports entertainment |publisher=Madison.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to give the event more structure and to eliminate vandalism, the city and student organizations worked together to schedule performances by bands, and to organize activities.

===Architecture===
[[Image:Capitol Madison, WI.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Wisconsin State Capitol]]
The [[Wisconsin State Capitol]] dome, closely based on the dome of the [[United States Capitol|U.S. Capitol]], is the jewel of the Madison skyline, and is visible throughout the Madison area because of its position on the high point of the isthmus. A state law limits building heights within one mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) of the structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Holst, ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=_0pDAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Wisconsin+capitol:+official+guide+and+history&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=l9OpTpCbI-Lq0gGDpfiyDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Wisconsin Capitol: Official Guide and History]''. 2nd ed. Madison, WI: Author, 1919, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its location in the urban core, Capitol Square is well integrated with everyday pedestrian traffic and commerce, and the spoke streets—especially State Street and E. Washington—offer dramatic views of the capitol.

Architect [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] spent much of his childhood in Madison and studied briefly at the University, and is responsible for several Madison buildings. [[Monona Terrace]], a convention and community center overlooking Lake Monona, designed by Taliesin Architect and student of Wright Anthony Puttnam, was based on a 1957 Wright design. Wright designed the seminal [[Usonia|Usonian House]], which is located here. Another key Wright building, the [[First Unitarian Society of Madison|Unitarian Meeting House]], is in the adjacent suburb of [[Shorewood Hills, Wisconsin|Shorewood Hills]]. The [[Harold C. Bradley House]] in the University Heights neighborhood, designed collaboratively by [[Louis Sullivan|Louis H. Sullivan]] and [[George Grant Elmslie]] in 1908–1910, now serves as the Sigma Phi Fraternity.

[[Image:Harold-c-bradley-house.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Harold C. Bradley House]]

[[Overture Center|The Overture Center for the Arts]], designed by [[Argentina]]-born architect [[César Pelli]], stands on State Street near the capitol. Since opening in 2004, the center has presented shows and concerts in its Overture Hall, Capitol Theater and The Playhouse. The center houses the [[Madison Museum of Contemporary Art]]. Its style, unlike Pelli's [[Petronas Towers]], leans toward sleek [[modernism]], with simple expanses of glass framed by stone that are intended to complement the historic building facades preserved as part of the building's State Street exposure.

Many of the over 175 Madison buildings designed by the architectural firm of [[Claude and Starck]] are still standing, including [[Breese Stevens Field]], Doty School (now converted to condominiums), and many private residences.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.madisonmagazine.com/article.php?story_id=152147&amp;xstate=view_story Behold…The Genius Of Claude And Starck]&quot;, ''Madison Magazine''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The UW–Madison campus includes many buildings designed or supervised by architects [[J. T. W. Jennings]], including the Dairy Barn and Agricultural Hall, and by [[Arthur Peabody]], including the Memorial Union and the Carillon Tower. The density of the campus has grown to include 8- to 10-story [[high-rise]]s including dormitories, research facilities, and classrooms. Several campus buildings erected in the 1960s exhibit [[brutalist architecture]], which is now unpopular. In 2005 the University of Wisconsin embarked on a major redevelopment initiative that will transform the east end of its campus. The plan calls for the razing of a nearly a dozen 1950s to 1970s vintage buildings and the construction of new dormitories, administration, and classroom buildings, as well as the development of a new pedestrian mall extending to Lake Mendota.

'''Rhinelander''' is a city in and the [[county seat]] of [[Oneida County, Wisconsin|Oneida County]],{{GR|6}} [[Wisconsin]], [[United States]]. The population was 7,798 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].

==History==
The area that eventually became the city of Rhinelander was originally called Pelican Rapids by early settlers, named for the stretch of rapids just above the convergence of the Wisconsin and Pelican Rivers. Around 1870, [[Anderson W. Brown]] of [[Stevens Point]] and Anson P. Vaughn traveled up the [[Wisconsin River]] in order to cruise timber for Brown's father, E. D. Brown. Upon arriving at the meeting point of the Wisconsin and Pelican Rivers at the site of John Curran's trading post, and seeing the high banks along the rapids and the excellent pine stands, Anderson Brown envisioned a mill town with a lumber mill powered by the waters of the Wisconsin River. Brown's vision would not come to fruition for some years, however after subsequent expeditions with others including his brother and Rhinelander's first mayor, [[Webster Brown]], the brothers managed to convince their father and uncle to purchase the land from the federal government and build a town. In its charter, the city was named Rhinelander after Frederic W. Rhinelander of New York, who was president of the Milwaukee, Lake Shore &amp; Western Road at the time. This was part of a bid by the Brown brothers to induce the railroad to extend a spur to the location to further their lumbering business. Ultimately, after over ten years of negotiations, the Brown family agreed to convey half their land holdings in the area to the railroad in exchange for a rail line to their future city. In 1882, the railroad line from present-day [[Monico, Wisconsin|Monico]] to Rhinelander was completed, jump starting the development of Rhinelander as the commercial hub of the region.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rhinelander&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last=Olsen| first=T.

==History==
The American Indians called the area &quot;Ahdawagam&quot;, meaning &quot;Two-sided Rapids&quot;. Although Europeans began to settle this area in the 1830s, Wisconsin Rapids has been known by this name only since 1920. Prior to that, the community was divided by the [[Wisconsin River]], with the west side incorporated as Centralia and the east side as Grand Rapids. The two cities merged in 1900, with the entire community taking the name Grand Rapids. The name was changed in 1920 to avoid mail and other goods from being misdirected to the much better known [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wirapids.org&lt;/ref&gt;
