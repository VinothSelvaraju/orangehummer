'''Monessen''' is a city in [[Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania|Westmoreland County]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[United States]]. The population was 7,720 at the 2010 census. In 1940, 20,257 people lived there. In 1990 the population was 13,026. Monessen is the most southwestern municipal of Westmoreland County. Steel-making was a prominent industry in Monessen, which was a [[Rust Belt]] borough in the &quot;[[Monongahela River|Mon]] Valley&quot; of southwestern [[Commonwealth of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]] that became a third-class city in 1921. It is near [[Charleroi, Pennsylvania|Charleroi]] and [[Donora, Pennsylvania|Donora]], two similar places with similar histories.

==History==
Monessen, named for the [[Monongahela River]] and the industrial German city of [[Essen]], was created by land speculators fairly late in the history of the Mon Valley, after neighboring towns had already been settled.  The ''East Side Land Company'' bought land from various farmers, laid out the streets, and then sold the lots to prospective residents and employers. [[James M. Schoonmaker]], who had made his fortune in [[coke (fuel)|coke]], owned a controlling interest in the land company. Other investors in the land company who were also immortalized in street names include [[Philander C. Knox]], [[James H. Reed]], H. Sellers McKee, George O. Morgan, and George B. Motheral.&lt;ref name='Vivian-p13'&gt;{{cite book | last = Vivian | first = Cassandra | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Monessen: A Typical Steel Country Town | publisher = Arcadia Publishing | year = 2002 | location = Charleston, South Carolina | pages = 13 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-7385-2383-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1897, National Tin Plate Company, founded by [[William Donner]], began building its mill, thus becoming Monessen’s first employer. Sales of lots began on July 27, 1897, for the general public and other employers.&lt;ref name='Vivian-p13'/&gt; Monessen became a borough on September 3, 1898.&lt;ref name='PHMC'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phmc.state.pa.us/Bah/dam/counties/pdfs/Westmoreland.pdf |title=Westmoreland County (Dates of incorporation of municipalities) |accessdate=2008-05-24 |format=PDF |publisher=Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monessen experienced rapid growth in the first two decades of the twentieth century, the population increasing from 2,197 in 1900 to 11,775 in 1910 and then to 18,179 in 1920.

While there were many companies operating in Monessen, the largest employer was Pittsburgh Steel Company, later renamed [[Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel]].  In a practice that is shocking by today’s standards (and not limited to Monessen), pay was determined by ethnic background. For example, a Welsh immigrant would be paid more than an Italian immigrant. A normal workweek was 84 hours (7 days times 12 hours).&lt;ref name='Vivian-p53'&gt;{{cite book | last = Vivian | first = Cassandra | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Monessen: A Typical Steel Country Town | publisher = Arcadia Publishing | year = 2002 | location = Charleston, South Carolina | pages = 53 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-7385-2383-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Employers did not adopt the eight hour workday until the 1920s.

Monessen’s status changed from “borough” to “city” on September 16, 1921.&lt;ref name='PHMC'/&gt;

In the years following [[World War II]], the region’s manufacturers, especially the steel industry, found it harder to compete, leading to a period of employment cutbacks. In 1972, the closure of Page Steel and Wire Company was a major setback to the city. A far greater blow to Monessen occurred when its largest employer, [[Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel]], closed nearly all its Monessen operations in 1986.&lt;ref name='Vivian-p143-145'&gt;{{cite book | last = Vivian | first = Cassandra | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Monessen: A Typical Steel Country Town | publisher = Arcadia Publishing | year = 2002 | location = Charleston, South Carolina | pages = 143–145 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-7385-2383-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (The company’s rail mill did not close until March 1987,&lt;ref name='Vivian-p143-145'/&gt; due to a bad batch of rails that were shipped.) The mill’s closure marked the end of an era in Monessen's history.

Monessen is currently trying to revitalize itself. The city has made efforts for several years to clean up abandoned properties in hopes of revitalizing the city. In January 2010 the first female mayor, Mary Jo Smith was sworn in at the Monessen Municipal Building.

The [[Charleroi-Monessen Bridge]] was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1988.&lt;ref name=&quot;nris&quot;&gt;{{NRISref|version=2010a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Corry''' is a city located in [[northwestern Pennsylvania]] in the [[United States]]. With a population of 6,605 at the [[2010 United States Census]], it is the second largest city in [[Erie County, Pennsylvania|Erie County]]. Corry is a part of the [[Erie, PA Metropolitan Statistical Area]]. The city became famous in the late-19th and early-20th centuries for being the manufacturer of [[Climax locomotive]]s.

==History==
Erie County was formed from parts of [[Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Allegheny County]] on March&amp;nbsp;12, 1800.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Hottenstein |first=JoAnne |last2=Welch |first2=Sibyl |chapter=Erie County |title=Incorporation dates of Pennsylvania municipalities |year=1965 |publisher=Bureau of Municipal Affairs, Pennsylvania Department of Internal Affairs |location=[[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]] |url=http://www.phmc.state.pa.us/bah/dam/counties/pdfs/Venango.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=June 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May&amp;nbsp;27, 1861, [[track (rail transport)|track]]s owned by the [[Atlantic and Great Western Railroad]] intersected with those of the [[Sunbury and Erie Railroad]] and was called the &quot;Atlantic and Erie Junction&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;etn&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |last=Springirth |first=Kenneth |title=Railroads that helped Corry thrive could be key to city's prosperity |date=June 13, 2011 |newspaper=[[Erie Times-News]] |url=http://www.goerie.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20110613/OPINION08/306139991/-1/etn02 |accessdate=June 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bates, p. 809.&lt;/ref&gt; Land at the junction was owned by Hiram Cory, who sold a portion to the Atlantic and Great Western in October&amp;nbsp;1861. The railroad constructed a ticket office at the junction and named it for Cory, but through a misspelling it became Corry.&lt;ref name=&quot;etn&quot;/&gt;

The combination of railroad growth and the discovery of oil in nearby Titusville contributed greatly to Corry's development.  This boomtown was chartered as a borough in 1863 and designated as a city in 1866.  Industry has played a big part in Corry's growth, and the Corry Area Historical Society maintains a museum where one of the Climax locomotives (the steam engine used in logging operations that brought fame to Corry) is on display.

Corry has been named a [[Tree City USA]] for seven consecutive years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Sear |first=Stephen |title=Tree City honors roll 7 in Corry |date=April 20, 2011 |newspaper=The Corry Journal |url=http://www.thecorryjournal.com/articles/2011/04/20/news/doc4daf15ace5a5d044338755.txt |accessdate=June 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Corry Armory]] was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1991.&lt;ref name=&quot;nris&quot;&gt;{{NRISref|version=2010a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The population was 5,565 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Census 2010&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://factfinder2.census.gov| title=Race, Hispanic or Latino, Age, and Housing Occupancy: 2010 Census Redistricting Data (Public Law 94-171) Summary File (QT-PL), Duquesne city, Pennsylvania| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau, American FactFinder 2| accessdate=September 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The borough of Duquesne was settled in 1789&lt;ref name=&quot;dates&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.phmc.state.pa.us/bah/dam/counties/pdfs/Allegheny.pdf |format=PDF|title = Allegheny County - 2nd class |accessdate = 2007-05-24 |publisher = [[Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and incorporated in 1891.

Duquesne Works, a productive [[steel mill]] that was part of [[Carnegie Steel Company|Carnegie Steel Corporation]] and later part of [[U.S. Steel]], was the heart and soul of Duquesne during its brightest moments in the early 20th century. Duquesne was home to the largest [[blast furnace]] in the world, named the &quot;Dorothy Six&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;The furnace's official name was Dorothy, after Dorothy Worthington, wife of the then-current USS CEO. &quot;#6&quot; was what the furnace was called by everyone who worked in Duquesne, referring to it being the sixth blast furnace built in Duquesne.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bob Dylan]]´s song ''[[Duquesne Whistle]]'' ([[Tempest (Bob Dylan album)|''Tempest'']], 2012) is dedicated to it.

The city's population peaked in 1930, then declined with [[deindustrialization]] beginning in the 1960s. Today a stark post-industrial landscape, Duquesne has fewer total residents (5,565 at the 2010 U.S. census) than were the city's mill workers in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;[http://explorepahistory.com/hmarker.php?markerId=788 ExplorePaHistory.com, s.v. Duquesne Steel Works]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[McKeesport Daily News]]'', Duquesne has the worst performing schools in the state of [[Pennsylvania]]. Duquesne was designated a [[Financially Distressed Municipalities Act|financially distressed municipality]] in 1991 by the state.

Duquesne High School closed in 2007. Beginning with the 2007-08 school year, Duquesne students have reported to [[West Mifflin Area School District|West Mifflin Area]] High School, or [[East Allegheny School District|East Allegheny]] High School. Since July 2007, the [[Allegheny Intermediate Unit]] (AIU) has managed all academic and business operations of the Duquesne's K-8 school district.

== History==
What is now the City of Monongahela was founded in 1769 on a tract of land near the [[confluence]] of Pigeon Creek and the [[Monongahela River]].  It is the oldest settlement in the Monongahela River Valley and most likely the oldest in Washington County.&lt;ref&gt;http://history.rays-place.com/pa/wash-monongahela.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  The original tract of land was actually owned by three different men, who named their land areas Eden, Paradise, and Gloucester.  Joseph Parkison, who operated a ferry on the west bank of the Monongahela River, is recognized as the founder of Monongahela.  Parkison built the town’s first post office, and in 1782 the town was officially recognized as Parkison’s Ferry.  Adam Wickerham took claim to {{convert|130|acre|km2}} on the Parkison Ferry tract, July 1, 1788. On this tract he laid out Georgetown in 1807. Georgetown was made part of Williamsport by him on Feb. 23, 1816. In 1833 the first borough officers were elected for Williamsport. On April 1, 1837 Wiliamsport was given the name Monongahela City and in 1893 shortened to Monongahela.

The word Monongahela is [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] in origin, meaning “falling banks”.  The [[Monongahela tribe]] was also indigenous to the area prior to the settlement of the city.

The [[Edward G. Acheson House]], [[Bethel African American Episcopal Church of Monongahela City]], [[David Longwell House]], and [[Monongahela Cemetery]] are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nris&quot;&gt;{{NRISref|2010a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Places of interest ==
Monongahela is home to many parks, playgrounds and museums.  Chess Park, located near the center of the city, hosts community events throughout the year.  The Mounds Park, built on the site of an ancient Indian Burial Ground, is a local playground and sports complex.  On the banks of the Monongahela River is the Aquatorium, a waterfront venue that hosts the annual Fourth of July celebration.  The Historical Society Museum and Monongahela River Museum are also located within the city.

Whiskey Point, a bluff overlooking the Monongahela River located within the city, was an important meeting place during the [[Whiskey Rebellion]].  The Pennsylvania State Historical Marker located here reads:  &quot;The bluff at Main St. and Park Ave. was the site on Aug. 14, 1794, of a meeting of 226 whiskey rebels. [[Albert Gallatin]]'s eloquence turned the tide, resulting in peaceful ending of the Whiskey Rebellion and the possibility of civil strife.&quot;

Many buildings in Monongahela, such as the Longwell House and the Bethel A.M.E Church, were used by freed slaves as stops on the [[Underground Railroad]].

There are twenty churches representing fifteen denominations located in Monongahela.

== Park Avenue ==
Park Avenue, a two mile (3&amp;nbsp;km) stretch of road in Monongahela, has fostered a remarkable amount of notable people, most famous among them NFL [[Hall of Fame]] Quarterback [[Joe Montana]].

Other notable residents include [[Carl E. Vuono]], four-star general and Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army; Jim Jimirro, founder of the Disney Channel; Fred Cox, all-time leading scorer for the Minnesota Vikings and inventor of the Nerf ball; and Dr. Ronald V. Pellegrini, a world renowned cardiothoracic surgeon based in Pittsburgh.

A documentary about Park Avenue, titled “One Extraordinary Street” was released in 2008, produced by Laura M. Magone.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/08328/929534-58.stm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Landmarks==
Notable landmarks in Arnold have included:
*Arnold Station, established in 1867, which was Arnold’s railroad stop. It was so named because the land on which it was built was given by the Arnold Family.&lt;ref&gt;The Woman’s Club of New Kensington. Lore of Yore. New Kensington,Pennsylvania:Buhl Brothers Printing,1986.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Chambers Glass Company, which opened in 1891, was at the time the first, best equipped, and most efficient glass plant in the country.&lt;ref&gt;The Woman’s Club of New Kensington. Lore of Yore. New Kensington,Pennsylvania: Buhl Brothers Printing,1986.&lt;/ref&gt;
*George Moore Home, which was built with 17 rooms, but has since been demolished.
*The Morris Davis home stands across from where the George Moore home stood. Morris Davis built it very precisely, rejecting many loads of lumber if they had knotholes or any defects. It was one of the very first homes in the area that had electricity.
*The Hartley Howard Home was another home of that time, which still stands today, serving as apartments.
*Eiler Hall was a fashionable site for parties, dances, banquets and public shows. It is now a parking lot for city employees of the Municipal Building.
*The Edna Hotel was named after George Moore‘s daughter Edna in the late 1800s. It was the meeting place for all of Arnold at the turn of the 20th century.
*The John Fedan Store began as a rental for other merchants. When that did not follow through, Fedan started his own business with a small hardware store and later added a furniture and appliance store.
*The Arnold Drug Store opened in 1898 and was also the post office location at the time.

W.R. Gott was one of the leading merchants of his time in the city. He opened his own grocery store in 1914 at the age of twenty and added appliances to his line in 1920. It was the largest electric appliance dealer in Allegheny Valley and was Tri-Boro’s leading grocery store. In 1921 he built his own store and then expanded it in 1932. In 1936, he took over the Arnold Traffic Store, which had been a general store, a meeting place, a temporary church, an office, an amateur playhouse and a nightclub became W.R. Gott’s Furniture Store. In 1973, the building was sold to [[Goodwill Industries|Goodwill]] and it was later sold to Arnold Furniture, who still own it today.

==Growth==
The city has grown to include many family owned businesses, churches, volunteer ambulance and fire departments, the Arnold Police Department, [[YMCA]], Roosevelt Park and Arnold Chamber of Commerce.

==Education==
Arnold is served by the [[New Kensington–Arnold School District]], which includes six schools in New Kensington and Arnold: [[Valley High School (New Kensington, Pennsylvania)|Valley High School]], a middle school, and four elementary schools. The current middle school was Arnold's high school prior to the merger of the two districts.

'''Parker''' is a city located in [[Armstrong County, Pennsylvania|Armstrong County]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[United States]].  It is located in the extreme northwestern portion of the county. The population was 840 at the [[United States Census 2010|2010 census]].  The city was named for Judge John Parker, a lead surveyor of Lawrenceburg and founder/owner of Parker's Landing, the two villages which were combined to create Parker.

Parker is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Smallest City in the U.S.A.&quot;. Parker was incorporated as a city on March 1, 1873 by special state legislation in the midst of the northwestern Pennsylvania oil boom. The new municipality was called &quot;Parker&quot; and was made up of the earlier villages of Parker's Landing (on the Allegheny River) and Lawrenceburg (on the bluff above the river).  Residents assumed that Parker would quickly become a major population center, and, at the height of the oil boom, the population of Parker grew to over 20,000.  The boom quickly went bust, however, and by the 1880s the &quot;city&quot; returned to its historic, small village size, and a population of approximately 1,000.

== Transportation ==
* '''[[Roads]]'''

There are two highways that pass through Parker.  From the east, [[Pennsylvania Route 268|PA 268]] goes right through downtown, then proceeds north towards [[Foxburg, Pennsylvania|Foxburg]], and [[Emlenton, Pennsylvania|Emlenton]].  There is also an intersection with [[Pennsylvania Route 368|PA 368]] at the [[Parker Bridge]].[[Image:Parker Bridge.jpg|thumb|left|170px|[[Parker Bridge]]]]

* '''[[Waterways]]'''

The [[Allegheny River]], at this point is not used to transport goods and materials, but is still a navigable waterway for [[boating]].  The first lock ([[Allegheny River Lock and Dam No. 9]]) is located south of Parker, just past the borough of [[East Brady, Pennsylvania|East Brady]].

==Geography==
Parker is located at {{coord|41|5|39|N|79|40|58|W|type:city}} (41.094151, −79.682771){{GR|1}}.

'''Uniontown''' is a city in [[Fayette County, Pennsylvania|Fayette County]], [[Pennsylvania]], {{convert|50|mi|km}} southeast of [[Pittsburgh]] and part of the [[Pittsburgh Metro Area]]. The population was 10,372 at the 2010 census. It is the [[county seat]] and largest city of [[Fayette County, Pennsylvania|Fayette County]].{{GR|6}}

==History==
Popularly known as Beesontown, &quot;The Town of Union&quot; was founded by Henry Beeson on July 4, 1776, coincidentally the same date as the United States Declaration of Independence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fayettechamber.com/cwt/external/wcpages/visitor/ &quot;Uniontown&quot;], Fayette County Chamber of Commerce&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Road]], also known as the [[Cumberland Road]], was routed through Uniontown in the early 19th century, and the town grew along with the road (now US 40). Within 10&amp;nbsp;miles of Uniontown is [[Fort Necessity]], built by [[George Washington]] during the [[French and Indian War]] (part of the international [[Seven Years War]]).

Uniontown's role in the [[Underground Railroad]] in the antebellum years is commemorated by a marker on the corner of East Main Street and Baker Alley.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=1115 &quot;Underground Railroad&quot;], Historic Markers Database&lt;/ref&gt; Residents helped [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]] escaping from the South to freedom.

In the late nineteenth century, the town grew based on the development of coal mines and the steel industry. Uniontown was the site of violent clashes between striking coal miners and guards at the local [[Coke (fuel)|coke works]] during the [[Bituminous Coal Miners' Strike of 1894]].  Fifteen guards armed with carbines and machine guns held off an attack by 1500 strikers, killing five and wounding eight.&lt;ref&gt;G. E. Plumbe, ''The Great Coal Strike,'' [http://books.google.com/books?id=fRR_mxkNlsgC&amp;pg=PA78 ''The Daily News Almanac and Political Register for 1895''], ''Chicago Daily News,'' 1895; pp. 77-78&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Columbia Rolling Mill]], an [[iron]] and [[steel]] works, was located in Uniontown from 1887 to 1895. The mill was the town's top industry at that time. During the Coal Boom of the early part of the 20th century, Uniontown was home to at least 13 millionaires, the most (per capita) of any city in the United States. &quot;Coal barons&quot; and [[Carl Laemmle]], the president of [[Universal Films]], sponsored the famous [[Uniontown Speedway]] board track from 1916 to 1922. It was a mile and a quarter raceway.

As with most of Western Pennsylvania, Uniontown's economy waned during the region's [[deindustrialization]] of the late 20th century, when the steel industry restructured and many jobs went elsewhere, including offshore. This decline continued into the 21st century, and the population is about half its peak of 1940.

The [[USS Uniontown (PF-65)]], a Tacoma-class frigate, was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for Uniontown, Pennsylvania on August 16, 1944.

In 1967 Uniontown was the birthplace of the McDonald’s [[Big Mac]] sandwich.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/mcdonaldsr-celebrates-40-years-serving-twoallbeefpattiesspecialsaucelettucecheesepicklesonionsonasesameseedbunr-58510247.html www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ McDonald's Celebrates 40 Years] ''PR Newswire'', Official McDonald’s News release, August 22, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pabook.libraries.psu.edu/palitmap/BigMac.html] Big Mac History&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 the Big Mac Museum was opened in [[North Huntingdon]], Pennsylvania to the disappointment of some Uniontown residents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bing.com/images/search?q=big+mac+museum+photos+uniontown&amp;view=detail&amp;id=BBC196F7FE964C83D8342D69C6CD534ECD632743&amp;first=1] Big Mac Museum Photos&lt;/ref&gt; According to a McDonald’s spokesperson the decision was based on logistics and access, but it still did not sit well with some residents and an article was published in [[the Herald-Standard]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://thinkwebworks.com/ao/History.asp?ID=18 &quot;The Mystery of the Curry Burger!&quot;] ''Herald-Standard'' article, September 15, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Uniontown Downtown Historic District]], [[Gallatin School (Uniontown, Pennsylvania)|Gallatin School]], [[John S. Douglas House]], [[John P. Conn House]], and [[Adam Clarke Nutt Mansion]] are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nris&quot;&gt;{{NRISref|version=2010a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city has some of the most impressive architecture in the area. For a smaller city, it has a number of high rise buildings and has a very impressive skyline for a city of its size. Uniontown is also home to a number of large Victorian era homes.

==Geography==
Uniontown is located at 39°54'0&quot; [[Latitude|North]], 79°43'28&quot; [[Longitude|West]] (39.900040, -79.724478).{{GR|1}}

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|2.0|sqmi|km2}}  The city is 999&amp;nbsp;feet (304&amp;nbsp;m) above mean sea level and rests at the base of [[Chestnut Ridge (Laurel Highlands)|Chestnut Ridge]], the western-most ridge of the [[Appalachian mountains]] to the east. The National Pike or Cumberland Road crossed over the mountains and passed through the area which became the center of Uniontown. The route is now Business Route 40, as the mainline of US 40 bypasses the city center as a freeway loop called the George Marshall Parkway.

'''Hermitage''' is a city in [[Mercer County, Pennsylvania|Mercer County]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[United States]]. The population was 16,220 at the 2010 census. It is part of the [[Youngstown, Ohio|Youngstown]]&amp;ndash;[[Warren, Ohio|Warren]]&amp;ndash;[[Boardman, Ohio|Boardman]], [[Ohio|OH]]-PA [[Youngstown-Warren-Boardman, OH-PA Metropolitan Area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]].

==History==
Formerly known as Hickory Township (hence Hickory High School with its Hickory Hornet mascot). The City of Hermitage, in [[Mercer County, Pennsylvania|Mercer County]], [[Pennsylvania]], was first settled in 1796, and the Township of Hickory was incorporated in 1832 from portions of the [[Shenango Township, Mercer County, Pennsylvania|Shenango]] and [[Pymatuning Township, Pennsylvania|Pymatuning]] townships. Following the incorporation of the cities of [[Sharon, Pennsylvania|Sharon]] and [[Farrell, Pennsylvania|Farrell]] and the Boroughs of [[Sharpsville, Pennsylvania|Sharpsville]] and [[Wheatland, Pennsylvania|Wheatland]], the remainder of the Township was incorporated into a First Class Township.

The Home Rule Charter and Optional Plans Law, Act 62 of 1972, provided all local governments in Pennsylvania a unique opportunity of true &quot;home rule.&quot; On August 9, 1972, Ordinance 13-72 was enacted by the Board of Commissioners, providing for a referendum on electing a Governmental Study Commission of nine members. On November 17, 1972, the electors voted in favor of a commission and selected nine members with the task of studying present Township government and the alternative of an Optional Plan of Government or a Home Rule Charter.

On March 13, 1974, the final report of the Government Study Commission recommended a Home Rule Charter, which was approved on May 21, 1974 by a vote of 1,375 to 546. The Charter was to become effective on January 1, 1976.

A resolution of April 9, 1975 stated the Board of Commissioners' intent to start an informal campaign to consider the possibility of a name change for the Township. A survey was conducted to determine possible names. In July, 1975, the Commissioners petitioned to the Court of Common Pleas of Mercer County pursuant to the Act of June 14, 1957, P.L. 330. The petition contained almost double the signature requirement of ten percent of the registered electors of the Township. The questions to be placed on the ballot were whether the name of the Township should be changed, and if so, which name: &quot;Hermitage,&quot; &quot;Mount Hickory,&quot; &quot;Hickory Hills.&quot;

On November 4, 1975, the voters approved, by 2,986 to 695, a change in name, and selected &quot;Hermitage.&quot; The President Judge of Mercer County Court of Common Pleas issued an order on December 11, 1975 decreeing that the name of the Township of Hickory shall be changed to Hermitage, Pennsylvania, effective January 2, 1976.

On [[1985 United States – Canadian tornado outbreak|May 31, 1985]] Hermitage was struck by an F5 tornado that killed 18 people and injured 310. It was the strongest tornado ever recorded in Pennsylvania.

'''Oil City''' is a city in [[Venango County, Pennsylvania|Venango County]], [[Pennsylvania]] that is known in the initial exploration and development of the [[petroleum industry]]. After the first [[oil well]]s were drilled nearby in the 1850s, Oil City became central in the petroleum industry while hosting headquarters for the [[Pennzoil]], [[Quaker State]], and [[Wolf's Head (motor oil)|Wolf's Head]] motor oil companies. Tourism plays a prominent role in the region by promoting oil heritage sites, nature trails, and [[Victorian architecture]]. The population was 10,557 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], and is part of the [[Oil City, PA Micropolitan Statistical Area]].

==History==
[[File:Tarbell 1904 Fleet of Oil Boats at Oil City 1864.jpg|thumb|left|Fleet of Oil Boats at Oil City, 1864.]]
[[File:Allegheny River Ice Jam.jpg|thumb|left|Ice jam on Oil Creek near Oil City, during mid/late 1970s.]]
In the early 17th century, the [[Seneca nation]] first settled in the region; by, the late 18th century Chief [[Cornplanter]] was given three tracts of land as a &quot;gift&quot; from the State of Pennsylvania. In 1818, local prospectors purchased the land and built a [[blast furnace]], which closed in the early 1850s. As population in the area began to decline, [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Edwin L. Drake]] drilled the first commercially successful oil well on August 27, 1859, in nearby [[Titusville, Pennsylvania|Titusville]]. A number of [[boomtown]]s came to life in the region, including Oil City, Titusville, [[Petroleum Center, Pennsylvania|Petroleum Center]], [[Pithole, Pennsylvania|Pithole]], and [[Rynd Farm, Pennsylvania|Rynd Farm]].

Barges were used to transport the oil down Oil Creek and into Oil City, where it was transported to steamboats or bulk barges to continue on to [[Pittsburgh]] and other locations. Oil City was founded in 1860,{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} incorporated as a borough in 1868,{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} and chartered as a city in 1874.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} The Borough of Oil City was incorporated as a city in 1871.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} The city was partially destroyed by flood in 1865 and by both flood and fire in 1866 and again in 1892; on this last occasion, several oil tanks that were struck by lightning gave way, and Oil Creek carried a mass of burning oil into the city, where some 60 lives were lost and property valued at more than $1 million was destroyed. Oil City grew into a thriving community through the later half of the 19th century and into the 20th century. By the 1990s, Pennzoil, Quaker State, and Wolf's Head had all relocated their headquarters elsewhere. However, some oil wells continue to produce a steady supply of quality petroleum.

Regional governments and public organizations promote tourism by thoroughly educating the public about oil history.  Oil City's location along the Allegheny River in the foothills of the [[Appalachian Mountains]] provides excellent opportunities for exploring Northwestern Pennsylvania.

The [[Oil City Downtown Commercial Historic District]], [[Oil City North Side Historic District]], [[Oil City South Side Historic District]], [[National Transit Building]], and [[Oil City Armory]] are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nris&quot;&gt;{{NRISref|version=2010a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
Oil City, Pennsylvania is located at the confluence of the [[Allegheny River]] and [[Oil Creek (Allegheny River)|Oil Creek]] at {{Coord|41.428280|-79.707327|type:city_region:US|format=dms|display=inline}}.{{GR|1}}  According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|4.7|sqmi|km2}}, of which, {{convert|4.5|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|0.2|sqmi|km2}} (4.65%) is water.

Many layers of rock and sedimentary material containing fossils can be seen on the [[hill|bluffs]] in and around Oil City.  Oil City is framed by the surrounding foothills with the Allegheny River winding through downtown.

The Allegheny River and Oil Creek freeze occasionally during the winter, sometimes causing [[ice dam|ice jams]]; although remediation by the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] has reduced ice formation via a floating ice control structure on the river and a fixed concrete weir on the banks of the creek.&lt;ref name=&quot;Army Corps&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lrp.usace.army.mil/fc/oilcity.htm|title=Pittsburgh District – Oil City, PA Ice Control Structure|date=2005-12-09|publisher=U.S. Army Corps of Engineers|accessdate=2009-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flooding of the river flats is a possibility throughout the year due to ice jams, excessive snow melt, large volume storms and hurricane or tropical storm remnants.

'''Aliquippa''' is a city in [[Beaver County, Pennsylvania|Beaver County]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Pennsylvania]]; it is within the [[Pittsburgh metropolitan area]].  The population was 9,438 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].  Formerly the borough of Aliquippa, it was formally named a city in 1987 by the Aliquippa Borough Council.

==History==
Aliquippa was founded by the merger of three towns: Aliquippa, Woodlawn, and New Sheffield.&lt;ref name=BCB&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bchistory.org/beavercounty/BeaverCountyCommunities/Aliquippa/Aliquippa.html |title=Aliquippa |work=Beaver County Bicentennial Atlas |year=2002 |accessdate=July 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no evidence connecting the [[Seneca nation|Seneca]] [[Queen Alliquippa]] with the location of the borough. This was one of several Indian names selected arbitrarily by the [[Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad]] in 1878 for stations along the route.&lt;ref name=BCB/&gt; Aliquippa is best known as the location of a productive steel mill that the [[Jones and Laughlin Steel Company]] constructed there along the [[Ohio River]] beginning in 1905. Employment at the facility sustained a population of 27,023 in 1940.&lt;ref name=BCB/&gt;[[Image:Aliquippa Station.JPG|thumb|left|150px|[[Aliquippa Station|P&amp;LE Station]]]] The mill closed during the collapse of the [[steel industry]] during the 1980s. This major economic loss alongside suburbanization caused a major population loss through the end of the 20th century. The oldest church within the current boundaries of Aliquippa is Mt. Carmel Presbyterian Church (formerly White Oak Flats Presbyterian Church), established about 1793 in the New Sheffield region on Brodhead Road.&lt;ref name=BCB/&gt;  Many of the city's businesses have left since the closing of the mill. This has left the area economically depressed.

The [[B.F. Jones Memorial Library]] is a historical landmark of the community.

'''Warren''' is a city in [[Warren County, Pennsylvania|Warren County]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[United States]], located along the [[Allegheny River]]. The population was 9,710 at the 2010 census. It is the [[county seat]] of [[Warren County, Pennsylvania|Warren County]].{{GR|6}} It is home to the headquarters of the [[Allegheny National Forest]] and the [[Cornplanter State Forest]]. It is also the headquarters for the [[Chief Cornplanter Council]], the oldest continuously chartered [[Boy Scouts of America]] Council, and the catalog company [[Blair Corporation|Blair]].  Warren is the principal city of the [[Warren, PA Micropolitan Statistical Area]].  

==History==
Warren was initially inhabited by Native Americans of the [[Seneca nation]]. French explorers had longstanding claims to the area which they acted to secure in an unambiguous fashion with an military-Amerindian expedition in 1749 that buried a succession of plaques claiming the territory as France's in response to the formation of the colonial [[Ohio Company]]{{mdash}}and the first of these was buried in Warren&lt;ref

|quote=Thereupon to counteract the designs of the English, the Governor-General of Canada, the Marquis de la Galissoniere, sent Celoron in 1749 down the Allegheny and Ohio riversm to take possession of the country in the name of the King of France. His command consisted of 215 French and Canadian soldiers and 55 Indians of various tribes. ... omitted ... Provided with a number of leaden plates, the left... omitted ... by means of [[Chatauqua creek]], a portage, [[Chautauqua Lake]] and [[Conewango creek]], they came on the 29th, to the Allegheny river, near the point now occupied by the town of Warren, in Warren County, Pa. The first of the leaden plates was buried at this point. (''Q.E.D.'')

&lt;/ref&gt; but ultimately control was transferred to the British after the [[French and Indian War]]. After the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], General [[William Irvine (physician)|William Irvine]] and [[Andrew Ellicott]] were sent to the area to lay out a town in 1795. It was named after Major General [[Joseph Warren]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epodunk.com/cgi-bin/genInfo.php?locIndex=15026|title=Profile for Warren, Pennsylvania|publisher=[[ePodunk]]|accessdate=2010-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first permanent structure in Warren, a storehouse built by the [[Holland Land Company]], was completed in 1796. [[Daniel McQuay]] of Ireland was the first permanent inhabitant of European descent. Lumber was the main industry from 1810&amp;ndash;1840, as the abundance of wood and access to water made it profitable to float lumber down the Allegheny River to [[Pittsburgh]].
  
[[David Beaty]] discovered oil in Warren in 1875 while drilling for natural gas in his wife's flower garden. Oil came to dominate the city's economy. Many of the town's large Victorian homes were built with revenue generated by the local oil and timber industries.

In recent years, Warren has struggled through hard economic times and a steady decline in population (after peaking at nearly 15,000 residents in 1940), but the city is attempting to bounce back with the [[Impact Warren]] project, a riverfront development project in downtown Warren. The completed project will include new townhouses and senior citizen housing, retail and commercial development, a parking garage, convention center and bus depot.

'''Chester''' is a city in [[Delaware County, Pennsylvania]], United States, with a population of 33,972 at the 2010 [[census]].  Chester is situated on the [[Delaware River]], between the cities of [[Philadelphia]] and [[Wilmington, Delaware]].

== History ==
The first [[New Sweden|European settlers]] in the area were [[Sweden|Swedes]]. They called the settlement that became Chester first Finlandia (The Latin name for Finland), then Upland (see the Swedish province of [[Uppland]] and the borough of [[Upland, Pennsylvania|Upland]]). They built Fort Mecoponacka in 1641 to defend the settlement.&lt;ref&gt;''Narratives of Early Pennsylvania, West New Jersey and Delaware 1630–1707'' (edited by Albert Cook Myers.  New York: Charles Scribner's Sons. 1912) http://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=6006508&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Hendrickson House.JPG|thumb|left|[[Hendrickson House]], built in Chester in 1690 by Swedish farmers, was moved to Wilmington, Delaware, in 1958]]
By 1682, Upland was the most populous town of the new [[Province of Pennsylvania]]. On October 27, the ship ''Welcome'' arrived at the town, bearing [[William Penn]] on his first visit to the province. Penn renamed the settlement for the [[England|English]] city of [[Chester]].{{Citation needed|date = June 2012}}

Chester served as the county seat for [[Chester County, Pennsylvania|Chester County]], which then stretched from the [[Delaware River]] to the [[Susquehanna River]]. In 1789, the city became the county seat for the newly created Delaware County (whereupon Chester County became landlocked, with [[West Chester, Pennsylvania|West Chester]] as its county seat), but the county seat was moved to the borough of [[Media, Pennsylvania|Media]] in 1851. The courthouse is near the new City Hall building.{{Citation needed|date = June 2012}}

Chester's naval shipyard supplied the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], and the United States in subsequent wars until the shipyard at Philadelphia became dominant after [[World War II]]. America's largest [[Reconstruction era of the United States|postbellum]] shipyard, [[John Roach]]'s [[Delaware River Iron Ship Building and Engine Works]], was also located at Chester. The [[Sun Shipbuilding &amp; Drydock Co.]], later Pennsylvania Shipyard &amp; Dry Dock Company, was located in Chester until it closed in 1990. Two ships of the [[United States Navy]] have been named [[USS Chester|USS ''Chester'']] in honor of the city.{{citation needed|date = June 2012}}

On April 10, 1917 an explosion at the Eddystone Ammunition Corporation near Chester resulted in the deaths of 133 workers, mostly women.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} 

Chester is one of numerous places that claim to be the birthplace of the [[hoagie]] sandwich.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chestercity.com |title=City of Chester, PA |author=George Sheridan |date=2008-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also known as the &quot;Cradle of [[Rock 'n Roll]]&quot;{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} as [[Bill Haley &amp; His Comets]] first performed and maintained their headquarters in the Chester area.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

== Economy ==
Chester began losing its mainstay [[shipyard]] and [[automobile manufacturing]] jobs as early as the 1960s, causing the population to be halved in fifty years from 65,000 in 1950 to under 37,000 in 2000. Poverty and crime rose as the city declined. In 1995, the state designated Chester as a [[Financially Distressed Municipalities Act|financially distressed municipality]]. Soon thereafter, the city's schools ranked last among the state's 501 districts, leading Pennsylvania education officials in 2001 to hire the for-profit [[Edison Schools]] to run the local school district for three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://interversity.org/lists/arn-l/archives/Jan2003/msg00857.html |title=Edison in Chester Upland |author=George Sheridan |date=2003-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Chester became eligible for Pennsylvania's [http://koz.inventpa.com/Keystone Opportunity Zone (KOZ) program], firms began to accept state and local tax breaks to invest in KOZ-designated areas of this southeastern Pennsylvania city. The Wharf at Rivertown, a $60 million renovation of the [[Philadelphia Electric Company|Philadelphia Electric Company (PECO)]]'s {{convert|396000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} generating plant, which was originally built in Chester in 1918, has returned the waterfront to the local residents, providing both recreational and office space for new local endeavors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.preservationnation.org/magazine/ |title=New Power in Pennsylvania's Oldest City |publisher=Preservation Online |date=2003-10-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/stories/2001/12/10/focus2.html |title=Industrial Grandeur, PriceDraw First Tenant |publisher=Philadelphia Business Journal |date=2001-12-07 |first=Jim |last=Cory}}&lt;/ref&gt; AdminServer is an upstart insurance software solution company that has drawn the market's attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adminserver.com/Marketing/PR-DeloitteFast2007.pdf |title=For the Second Consecutive Year, AdminServer was named to Deloitte’s Greater Philadelphia Technology Fast 50 and North America Technology Fast 500 |publisher=AdminServer news release |date=2007-10-31|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newpa.com/default.aspx?id=349 Pennsylvania Dept of Community and Economic Development]&lt;/ref&gt; Sun Shipbuilding converted part of the [[shipyard]] to a smaller shipping concern and sold its interest, then sold off portions of the rest to new users, such as the [http://www.cor.state.pa.us/chester/site/default.asp Pennsylvania State Correctional Institution Chester].

==Crime==
In 2010, Chester had 24 homicides, and a homicide rate of 64.3 per 100,000. The high homicide rate in 2010 prompted then-Mayor Wendell N. Butler, who previously served as the city's police chief before becoming mayor, to implement a &quot;State of Emergency,&quot; implementing 12-hour shifts for the entire city police force, assistance from both the Delaware County Sheriff's Office and the [[Pennsylvania State Police]], and a 9PM to 6AM curfew in five of the city's crime hotspots.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} The &quot;State of Emergency,&quot; which lasted 34-days, coincided with the opening of [[PPL Park]], but was sparked due to the murder of a 3-year old toddler in the city's crime-plagued West End (between Lamokin Street and the western borders with Upper Chichester Township and Trainer Borough).{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}  The city had 14 homicides in 2009, 17 in 2008, 27 in 2007, 18 in 2006, 15 in 2005, 19 in 2004, 12 in 2002, 19 in 2000, and nine in 1999.&lt;ref name=&quot;IDcide&quot;&gt;[http://www.idcide.com/citydata/pa/chester.htm IDcide Chester, PA Profile]&lt;/ref&gt; The city did not record crimes in 2003 and 2001.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

As of the census of 2010, there were 29,972 people living in the city.  The racial makeup of the city was 17.2% White, 74.7% Black, 0.4% Native American, 0.6% Asian, 0.1% Native Hawaiian, 3.9% of some other race, and 3.0% from two or more races.  9.0% were Hispanic or Latino of any race.

There were 12,814 households out of which 32.7% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 24.8% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 32.1% had a female householder with no husband present, and 36.6% were non-families. 31.2% of all households were made up of individuals and 11.2% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.64 and the average family size was 3.34.

The median income for a household in the city was $23,703, and the median income for a family was $29,436. Males had a median income of $29,528 versus $21,005 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the city was $9,052. About 22.8% of families and 27.2% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 36.9% of those under age 18 and 21.8% of those age 65 or over.

== Transportation ==

In Chester, east-west streets are numbered, while north-south streets carry names. The main bisecting street, known as The Avenue of the States south of 9th Street and Edgmont Avenue north of it, is signed as both [[Pennsylvania Route 320]] (southbound only; northbound PA Rt. 320 uses adjacent Madison Street to [[Interstate 95 in Pennsylvania|Interstate 95]]) and [[Pennsylvania Route 352]]. North of I-95, State Route 320 follows Providence Avenue.  Between 1993 and 2006, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) widened and realigned [[Pennsylvania Route 291]] from Trainer to Eddystone from a two-lane roadway to a five-lane roadway.  This widening and realignment project, spearheaded by the late State Senator Clarence D. Bell of Upland, allows PA Route 291 to maintain at least two travel lanes in each direct between the refinery towns of Marcus Hook and Trainer and the Philadelphia International Airport, as well as promote the riverfront development in the city.  Prior to the realignment, which was done first, the roadway followed 2nd Street to Crosby Street, then bore right onto E. 4th Street, widening to four lanes and becoming the &quot;Industrial Highway&quot; in Eddystone.  Post-realignment, the road now follows W. 2nd Street to Concord Avenue, becoming the &quot;Industrial Highway&quot; past Concord Avenue and bypassing the [[Kimberly-Clark]] (formerly Scott Paper) processing facility.

===Highways and bridges===
[[File:Commodore Barry Bridge From Ferry Rd.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Commodore Barry Bridge]] across the [[Delaware River]] at Chester]]
In addition to State Rt. 291, Chester is served by two [[interstate highways]]: [[Interstate 95 in Pennsylvania|Interstate 95]] and [[Interstate 476]], which meet in nearby Eddystone. I-95 was built in the 1960s and originally terminated just north of the Chester/Eddystone line at the present-day I-95/I-476 junction. It was extended north in the 1970s with the section around [[Philadelphia International Airport]] being completed in 1985. Three exits on I-95 allow access to Highland Avenue, Kerlin Street, and The Avenue of the States (Rts. 320 &amp; 352), with access to [[Widener University]], via State Rt. 320.  Of the three, only Kerlin Street is a partial exit, although the Avenue of the States exit was also a partial exit until the completion of a southbound on-ramp, also spearheaded by the late State Sen. Bell, was completed in 2002.  I-476, planned as an alternative route to State Rt. 320 since the 1920s and an original planned extension of the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]] in the 1950s (as part of the {{convert|1000|mi|km|sing=on}} Turnpike network), was finally opened to traffic in 1992. An exit at MacDade Boulevard (which becomes 22nd Street in Chester) allows access to I-476 without having to use I-95.

Two federal highway routes, [[U.S. Route 13]] and [[U.S. Route 322]], also run through Chester. U.S. Rt. 13 enters Chester from Trainer on W. 4th Street, becomes part of Highland Avenue between W. 4th St. and W. 9th Street, and then continues on 9th Street to Morton Avenue. U.S. Rt. 13 follows Morton Avenue in the city's Sun Village section until it crosses [[Ridley Creek]] and becomes Chester Pike in Eddystone.

U.S. Rt. 322 enters Chester as a part of I-95 (merging on at Highland Avenue) and then departs I-95 at the [[Commodore Barry Bridge]] exit. Prior to the bridge's opening in 1974, U.S. Rt. 322 would cross the [[Delaware River]] on the Chester-[[Bridgeport, New Jersey|Bridgeport]] Ferry, via Flower Street, causing major backups because of limited space on the ferries.  With the expansion of State Rt. 291 and the redevelopment of the Chester Waterfront, both the [[Delaware River Port Authority]] and PennDOT built a pair of entrance (westbound) and exit (eastbound) ramps to PA Rt. 291, providing direct access to the waterfront without using local streets.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}  The ramps were built between 2007 and 2010 and were opened in 2011.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

In addition, talks have taken place for the reconstruction of U.S. Rt. 322 from a two-lane road to a four-lane road between Chester and [[U.S. Route 1 in Pennsylvania|U.S. 1]] in [[Concordville, Pennsylvania]], and the Highland Avenue exit. The road currently requires traffic to merge onto I-95 in the left lane and requires changing lanes three times to the Commodore Barry Bridge exit ramp in less than a mile.  Such a major undertaking would result in the demolition of numerous homes in the city's crime-plagued Highland Gardens section, along with condemning properties in nearby [[Chester Township, Pennsylvania|Chester Township]], as I-95 passes through both municipalities between U.S. Rt. 322 and the Commodore Barry Bridge.

===Public transportation===
Public transportation in Chester is served by the [[SEPTA|Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority]] (SEPTA), which acquired the former Suburban Philadelphia Transit Authority (aka &quot;Red Arrow&quot; Lines) in 1968.  Seven bus routes (Routes 37, 109, 113, 114, 117, 118, and 119) serve the city, with the Chester Transportation Center in the city's business district, serving as the hub.  One route, Route 37, connects Chester with [[Philadelphia]] and the [[Philadelphia International Airport]], while another, Route 113 from [[69th Street Terminal]], connects Chester with the State of Delaware.  Both Routes 37 and 113 provides direct service with the Harrah's Philadelphia Racetrack and Casino located within the city, with the Route 113 also providing service to the [[Philadelphia Union]]'s [[PPL Park]] soccer-specific stadium on the city's waterfront.

The city is also served by SEPTA's [[Wilmington/Newark Line]] commuter rail service, via [[Amtrak]]'s [[Northeast Corridor]].  The Chester Transportation Center, while serving as the main bus hub in the city, also serves as the main train station in the city, while the [[Highland Avenue (SEPTA station)|Highland Avenue station]], located approximately 4 miles southwest of Chester T.C. station, is also served by Wilmington/Newark trains.  A third station, at [[Lamokin Street (SEPTA station)|Lamokin Street]], located approximately a mile east of the [[Commodore Barry Bridge]] at the junction of the NEC and the abandoned [[Penn Central]] [[Chester Creek Secondary Branch]], was operated by SEPTA as a [[flagstop]] station until it was closed and demolished in 2003 due to low usage.

Historically, the [[Chester Transportation Center]] was, like the [[Paoli (SEPTA station)|Paoli station]] on the [[Paoli/Thorndale Line]], both a commuter and intercity stop on the former [[Pennsylvania Railroad]]'s [[New York City|New York]]-[[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] route.  But when [[Amtrak]] took over intercity rail passenger services in 1971, the Chester Transportation Center was bypassed, except from April 30, 1978, to October 29, 1983, when the ''[[Chesapeake (Amtrak)|Chesapeake]]'' stopped once daily in each direction between [[Philadelphia]] and [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]].

==Education==

===Primary and secondary schools===

====Public schools====
The [[Chester-Upland School District]] serves the city, along with nearby [[Chester Township, Pennsylvania|Chester Township]] and [[Upland, Pennsylvania|Upland]]. [[Chester High School (Pennsylvania)|Chester High School]] is currently the district's sole high school, but a recent approval by the district's empowerment board will see the development of two [[magnet schools]]; one dedicated to the arts and another for science and technology.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

====Parochial schools====
The St. [[Katharine Drexel]] Parish, established in 1993 by the [[Archdiocese of Philadelphia]] with the consolidation of all Roman Catholic parishes in the city, maintains the city's only parochial school.  [[St. James High School for Boys]], the city's &quot;other high school&quot; and for many years, the main football rival for Chester High School, closed its doors in 1993 due to decreased enrollment.  The nearest Catholic high school to Chester is the [[Cardinal O'Hara High School]] in [[Springfield Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Springfield]] or, to parts of Chester, [[Archmere Academy]], [[Claymont, Delaware]].

====Charter schools====
[[Chester Community Charter School]] is a charter school established in 1998 that serves over 2,000 students in grades K-8.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publicschoolreview.com/school_ov/school_id/68307 Public school review] data sheet&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chestercommunitycharter.org/about.cfm About Us] page from the school website&lt;/ref&gt;  It is currently run by Steven Lee.

===Colleges and universities===
*[[Widener University]], formerly the Pennsylvania Military College (PMC), is in Chester.
*[[Sleeper's College]] was a vocational school for &quot;office and commercial training&quot; founded in 1910.

Chester is the home of the [[Philadelphia Union]], which plays its home games at [[PPL Park]], a [[soccer-specific stadium]] at the base of the [[Commodore Barry Bridge]].  Located on the Delaware River, the stadium is part of a larger development called Rivertown.  Financing for the Rivertown development was announced in early 2008 by Governor [[Ed Rendell]] and Pennsylvania Senate Majority Leader [[Dominic Pileggi]], with $25 million going to the construction of PPL Park, and an additional $7 million towards a two-phase project composing of 186 townhouses, 25 apartments, {{convert|335000|sqft|m2}} of office space, a {{convert|200000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} convention center, more than {{convert|20000|sqft|m2}} of retail space, and a parking structure to house 1,350 cars.  In phase two, another 200 apartments will be built, along with {{convert|100000|sqft|m2}} of office space and {{convert|22000|sqft|m2}} of retail space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Major hurdle cleared for Philly expansion | work=MLSnet.com| url=http://www.mlsnet.com//news/mls_news.jsp?ymd=20080131&amp;content_id=137294&amp;vkey=news_mls&amp;fext=.jsp| accessdate=January 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Johnstown''' is a city in [[Cambria County, Pennsylvania|Cambria County]], [[Pennsylvania]],&lt;ref name=&quot;GNIS1&quot;&gt;{{Cite gnis|id=1215025|name=City of Johnstown|accessdate=2010-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{convert|41|mi|km}} west-southwest of [[Altoona, Pennsylvania]] and {{convert|70|mi|km}} east of [[Pittsburgh]]. The population was 20,978 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. It is the principal city of the Johnstown, Pennsylvania, [[Metropolitan Statistical Area]], which includes [[Cambria County, Pennsylvania|Cambria County]].&lt;ref&gt;American Factfinder, 2010 census summary file 1, http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?fpt=table&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Johnstown, settled in 1770, is perhaps most famous for its three major [[flood]]s. The [[Johnstown Flood|&quot;Great Flood&quot;]] of May 31, 1889 occurred after the [[South Fork Dam]] collapsed {{convert|14.1|mi|km}} upstream from the city during heavy [[rain]]s. At least 2,209 people died as a result of the flood and subsequent [[fire]] that raged through the debris. Other major floods occurred in 1936 and 1977. Despite a pledge by President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] to make the city flood free, and subsequent work to do so, another major flood occurred in 1977. The 1977 flood - in what was to have been a &quot;flood free&quot; city - may have contributed to Johnstown's subsequent population decline and inability to attract new residents and businesses.

The city is home to five national [[Historic district (United States)|historic district]]s: the [[Downtown Johnstown Historic District]], [[Cambria City Historic District]], [[Minersville Historic District]], [[Moxham Historic District]], and [[Old Conemaugh Borough Historic District]].  Individual listings on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] are the [[Grand Army of the Republic Hall (Johnstown, Pennsylvania)|Grand Army of the Republic Hall]], [[Cambria Iron Company]], [[Cambria Public Library Building]], [[Inclined Plane Bridge|Bridge in Johnstown City]], [[Nathan's Department Store]], and [[Johnstown Inclined Plane|Johnstown Inclined Railway]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nris&quot;&gt;{{NRISref|version=2010a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1800-1900===
Johnstown was formally organized as a town in 1800 by the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[Ethnic German|German]] immigrant Joseph Johns (born Josef Schantz). The settlement was initially known as Schantzstadt, but was soon anglicized to Johnstown. From 1834 to 1854, the city was a port and key transfer point along the [[Pennsylvania Main Line of Public Works|Pennsylvania Main Line Canal]]. Johnstown was at the head of the canal's western branch, with canal boats having been transported over the mountains via the [[Allegheny Portage Railroad]] and refloated here, to continue the trip by water to Pittsburgh and the Ohio Valley. Perhaps the most famous passenger who traveled via the canal to visit Johnstown briefly was [[Charles Dickens]] in 1842. By 1854, canal transport became redundant with the completion of the Pennsylvania Railroad, which now spanned the state.  With the coming of the railroads, the city’s growth improved.  Johnstown became a stop on the main line of the Pennsylvania Railroad and was connected with the Baltimore &amp; Ohio.  The railroads provided large-scale development of the region’s mineral wealth.

[[Iron]], [[coal]], and [[steel]] quickly became central to the town of Johnstown. By 1860, the [[Cambria Iron Company]] of Johnstown was the leading steel producer in the United States, outproducing steel giants Pittsburgh and Cleveland. Through the second half of the 19th century, Johnstown made much of the nation's [[barbed wire]].  Johnstown prospered from skyrocketing demand in the western United States for barbed wire. Twenty years after its founding, the Cambria Works was a huge enterprise sprawling over {{convert|60|acre|m2}} in Johnstown and employing 7,000.  It owned {{convert|40000|acre|km2}} of valuable mineral lands in a region with a ready supply of iron, coal and limestone.

[[Image:Jflood.gif|thumb|left|This building was impaled on a tree by the raging waters of the 1889 Johnstown flood.]]
Floods were almost a yearly event in the valley during the 1880s.  On the afternoon of May 30, 1889, following a quiet Memorial Day ceremony and a parade, it began raining in the valley.  The next day water filled the streets and rumors began stating that a dam holding an artificial lake in the mountains to the northeast might give way.  The dam gave way and an estimated 20 million tons of water began spilling into the winding gorge that led to Johnstown some {{convert|14|mi|km}} away.   The destruction in Johnstown occurred in only about 10 minutes.  What had been a thriving steel town with homes, churches, saloons, a library, a railroad station, electric street lights, a roller-skating rink, and two opera houses was buried under mud and debris. Out of a population of approximately 30,000 at the time, at least 2,209 people are known to have perished in the disaster.  An infamous site of a major fire during the flood was the old stone Pennsylvania Railroad bridge located where the Stonycreek and Little Conemaugh Rivers form the Conemaugh River. The bridge still stands today.&lt;ref name=&quot;McCullough269&quot;&gt;[[David McCullough|McCullough, David]] (1987), ''The Johnstown Flood'', Second Touchstone Edition. New York: Touchstone, an imprint of [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], Inc., p. 269 ISBN 0-671-20714-8. (Original copyright: 1968, Simon &amp; Schuster.)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Johnstown Flood]] established the American Red Cross as the pre-eminent emergency relief organization in the United States.  Founder [[Clara Barton]], then 67, came to Johnstown with 50 doctors and nurses and set up tent hospitals as well as temporary &quot;hotels&quot; for the homeless, and stayed on for five months to coordinate relief efforts.&lt;ref name=&quot;McCullough229-231&quot;&gt;[[David McCullough|McCullough, David]] (1987), ''The Johnstown Flood'', Second Touchstone Edition. New York: Touchstone, an imprint of [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], Inc., pp. 229-231 ISBN 0-671-20714-8. (Original copyright: 1968, Simon &amp; Schuster.)&lt;/ref&gt;

The mills were back in operation within a month.  The Cambria Works grew, and Johnstown became more prosperous than ever.  The disaster had not destroyed the community but strengthened it.  Later generations would draw on lessons learned in 1889.

===20th century===
Johnstown was a remarkably prosperous hard-working city during the inter-war years. In the early 20th century, the population reached 75,000 people. Its public transportation was considered one of the best of any small city in the United States. The city's first commercial radio station, [[WKGE|WJAC]], began broadcasts in 1925. The downtown boasted at least five major department stores, including Glosser Brothers, which in the 1950s gave birth to the [[Gee Bee Department Stores|Gee Bee]] chain of department stores. However, the [[St Patrick's Day]] 1936 Flood combined with the gnawing effects of the [[Great Depression]] left Johnstown struggling again, but only temporarily. Johnstown’s citizens mobilized to achieve a permanent solution to the flooding problem and wrote to President Franklin Roosevelt pleading for Federal aid.  Starting in August 1938, continuing for the next five years, the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers gouged widened, deepened, and realigned {{convert|9.2|mi|km}} of channel in the city, and encased the river banks in concrete and reinforced steel.  In a campaign organized by the Chamber of Commerce, thousands of Johnstown’s citizens wrote to friends and relatives across the country hoping to bring new business to the town.  Professional hockey would find a home in Johnstown, starting in 1941 with the [[Johnstown Blue Birds]] for one season and returning in 1950 with the [[Johnstown Jets]]. The Jets later hosted an exhibition game against [[Maurice Richard]] and the [[Montreal Canadiens]] on November 20, 1951. The memory of floods was virtually purged from the community’s consciousness.  Newcomers to the town heard little about the tragic past.  Johnstown proclaimed itself &quot;flood-free,&quot; a feeling reinforced when Johnstown was virtually the only riverside city in Pennsylvania not to flood during [[Hurricane Agnes]] in 1972.

The immediate post-WWII years mark Johnstown's peak as a [[steel]] maker and fabricator. At its peak, steel provided Johnstowners with more than 13,000 full-time, well-paying jobs. However, increased domestic and foreign competition, coupled with Johnstown's relative distance from its primary iron ore source in the western [[Great Lakes]], led to a steady decline in profitability. New capital investment waned. Johnstown's mountainous terrain, and the resulting poor layout for the mills' physical plant strung along {{convert|11|mi|km}} of river bottom lands, compounded the problem.

New regulations ordered by the EPA in the 1970s also hit Johnstown with its aging plant especially hard.  A community with a lesser tradition might have reacted with despair.  Instead, with encouragement from the steel company, the city fathers organized an association called Johnstown Area Regional Industries (JARI) and, within a year, raised $3 million for industrial development in the area. Bethlehem Steel, which was the major contributor to the fund, committed itself to bringing new steelmaking technologies to Johnstown because they were impressed by the city’s own efforts to diversify.

Extensive damage from the 1977 flood was heavy and there was talk of the company pulling out.  Again, the city won a reprieve from the company’s top management, which had always regarded the Johnstown works with special affection because of its history and reputation.  As the increasing amount of federal environmental regulations became more difficult to comply with and the issues with the aging manufacturing facilities, in 1982, steel companies began closing down plants all over the country, it looked as if Johnstown had exhausted its appeals. By the early 1990s, Johnstown abandoned most of its steel production, although some limited fabrication work continues.
[[Image:Johnstownview.jpg|thumb|250px|right|View of the city of Johnstown from atop the Inclined Plane.]]

===2000s===
In 2003, U.S. [[Census]] data showed that Johnstown was the least likely city in the United States to attract newcomers; however, what were previously relatively weak opportunities provided by the local [[manufacturing]] and [[Service Sector|service]] economies have more recently begun to burgeon, attracting outsiders. [[Gamesa Corporación Tecnológica]], a Spanish wind energy company, opened its first U.S. wind turbine blade manufacturing facility near here in 2006. Several state-of-the-art operational wind turbines are sited on Babcock Ridge, the &quot;eastern continental divide,&quot; along the eastern edge of Cambria and Somerset Counties.  [[Lockheed Martin]] relocated a facility from Greenville, SC to Johnstown in 2008.

Companies like Concurrent Technologies Corporation, DRS Laurel Technologies, ITSI Biosciences, Kongsberg Defense and more throughout the region are embracing cutting edge technology and scientific progress to create products that make life easier, better and greener.  Recent construction in the surrounding region, the downtown, and adjacent Kernville neighborhood—including a new {{convert|100000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} Regional Technology Complex that will house a division of [[Northrop Grumman]], among other tenants—signal the increasing dependence of Johnstown's economy on the U.S. government's defense budget. The high-tech defense industry is now the main non-health-care staple of the Johnstown economy, with the region pulling in well over $100M annually in Federal government contracts, punctuated by one of the premier defense trade shows in the U.S., the annual Showcase For Commerce.

Johnstown remains a regional [[Medicine|medical]], [[education]]al, cultural, and [[telecommunication|communications]] center. As in many other locales, health care provides a significant percentage of the employment opportunities in the city.  The region is located right in the middle of the “Health Belt”, an area stretching from the Midwest to New England and down the East Coast that has had massive growth in the health care industry.  Incredible progress is being made at Memorial Medical Center and Windber Medical Center, especially at the Laurel Highlands Neuro-Rehabilitation Center and the John P. Murtha Neuroscience and Pain Institute, with its advances in treating wounded veterans, and the Joyce Murtha Breast Care Center’s focus on early diagnosis and advanced treatment.
[[Image:Jtowndowntown.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Downtown Johnstown from street view.]]
The [[University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown]] and Pennsylvania Highlands Community College both attract thousands of students to their contiguous modern campuses in Richland, five miles (8&amp;nbsp;km) east of Johnstown.  Cambria-Rowe Business College, located in the Moxham section of Johnstown, offers concentrated career training and has continuously served Johnstown since 1891.  The [[Pasquerilla Performing Arts Center]], a concert/theatrical venue at the University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown, continues to attract high-quality performers. The [[Johnstown Symphony Orchestra]] and the recently formed Johnstown Symphony Chamber Players provide classical music. The Johnstown Concert Ballet, centered in the Historic Cambria City District, provides classical ballet performances and training to the area.  The [[Pasquerilla Convention Center]] was recently constructed downtown, adjacent to the historic [[Cambria County War Memorial Arena]] at 326 Napoleon Street. [[Point Stadium]], a baseball park where Babe Ruth once played, was razed and rebuilt. A recently passed zoning ordinance created an artist zone and a traditional neighborhood zone to encourage both artistic endeavors and the old-fashioned &quot;Mom and Pop&quot; enterprises that had difficulty thriving under the previous code. The [[Bottleworks Ethnic Arts Center]] offers many exhibitions, events, performances, and classes that celebrate the rich and diverse cultural heritage of the Area. The Johnstown Chiefs hockey team managed to provide affordable family entertainment to the region for 22 seasons, the longest period a franchise of the league stayed in one city. The Chiefs were a member team of the ECHL, the premier &quot;AA&quot; hockey league in North America, and played their home games in the [[Cambria County War Memorial Arena]].  The Chiefs decision to relocate caused a flood of public interest in the sport of hockey.  As many as 4 leagues were interested in having a team in the War Memorial.  In the end the city landed a deal with another ECHL team the [[Wheeling Nailers]]. The [[CJL Engineering]] Office Building at 232 Horner Street was awarded a LEED Silver Certification by the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) on March 30, 2010. It is the first fully certified LEED building in Johnstown.  The recently established [[ART WORKS In Johnstown!]] houses artist studios in some of the area's architecturally significant but underused industrial buildings. The ART WORKS in Johnstown project is projected to be a Non-Profit LEED-certified green building. The Frank &amp; Sylvia Pasquerilla Heritage Discovery Center opened in 2001 with the permanent exhibit America: Through Immigrant Eyes, which tells the story of immigration to the area during the Industrial Revolution. In June 2009, the Heritage Discovery Center opened the Johnstown Children's Museum and premiered &quot;The Mystery of Steel,&quot; a film detailing the history of steel in Johnstown. The Bottleworks Ethnic Arts Center, ART WORKS, and the Heritage Discovery Center are located in the historic Cambria City section of town, which boasts a variety of eastern European ethnic [[church (building)|church]]es and social halls. This neighborhood hosted the [[National Folk Festival (USA)|National Folk Festival]] for three years in the early 1990s, which expanded into the [[Flood City Music Festival]]. Johnstown also hosts the annual [[Thunder in the Valley motorcycle rally]] during the fourth week of June; the event has attracted motorcyclists from across the Northeast to the city of Johnstown since 1998. Well over 200,000 participants enjoyed the 2008 edition of Thunder In The Valley and the event continues to grow in size.

Significant and largely successful efforts have been made to deal with deteriorating housing, [[brownfield]]s, drug problems, and other issues as population leaves the city limits and concentrates in suburban boroughs and townships. The Johnstown Fire Department has become a leader in developing intercommunication systems among [[first responder]]s, and is now a national model for ways to avoid the communications problems which faced many first responders during the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]].

===2010s===
The [[Ultimate Indoor Football League]] is a new indoor football league that has formed for the 2011 season.  The leagues first team will call Johnstown home as announced by the Tribune Democrat in May 2010.  A contest held through the Tribune named the team the [[Johnstown Generals]].
As announced on February 23, 2011 by the Tribune Democrat, professional baseball will be returning to the Point Stadium.  The ownership of the team is the same as that of the Johnstown Generals.  The league is titled the [[Ultimate Baseball League]]

==Johnstown in the arts and literature==
[[The River (Bruce Springsteen song)|&quot;The River&quot; (Bruce Springsteen song)]] mentions the Johnstown Company - &quot;I got a job working construction, for the Johnstown Company, but lately there ain't been no work on account of the economy.&quot;

[[Highway Patrolman]], another Springsteen song, has lyrics &quot;as the band played 'Night of the Johnstown Flood.'&quot;

Two major motion pictures have been filmed in Johnstown, taking advantage of the city's atmosphere. The first is 1977's ''[[Slap Shot (film)|Slap Shot]]'', directed by [[George Roy Hill]] and featuring [[Paul Newman]] as an aging hockey player/coach. The screenplay by [[Nancy Dowd]] was a parody loosely based on the real-life [[Johnstown Jets]] hockey team and its [[North American Hockey League]] championship in 1976. In the movie, Johnstown was rechristened &quot;Charlestown&quot; and the Jets as the [[Charlestown Chiefs]]. The film's premiere engendered some local controversy, as some thought Johnstown was portrayed in a less than flattering light. The name &quot;Charlestown&quot; itself is believed to be a reference to Charles Kunkle, an influential local businessman of the era. ''Slap Shot'' has since become the iconic movie about hockey and its foibles. Nancy Dowd would revive the fake town of &quot;Charlestown&quot; in her screenplay for the 1981 [[punk rock]] satire ''[[Ladies and Gentlemen, The Fabulous Stains]]'', but the film itself was shot in [[Canada]].

The second major film was ''[[All the Right Moves (film)|All the Right Moves]]'', a high school football drama set in the fictional town of Ampipe and featuring [[Tom Cruise]], [[Lea Thompson]] and [[Craig T. Nelson]]. Locations seen in the movie are the old Johnstown High School in [[Kernville, Pennsylvania|Kernville]], torn down shortly afterwards; the Carpatho-Russian Citizen's Club in East Conemaugh; the Franklin works of Bethlehem Steel; the Point Stadium; the Johnstown &quot;Cochran&quot; Junior High football practice field and the Johnstown Vo-Tech football locker room.

Part of the film ''[[Rock Star (2001 film)|Rock Star]]'' takes place in Pittsburgh and several scenes, including the opening scene, were filmed in Johnstown.

Historian [[David McCullough]] wrote what is widely regarded as the city's definitive history, ''The Johnstown Flood'', in 1968. McCullough completed his research with the aid of the remaining flood survivors.

Author C. Coco de Young used her own family history to write about first-generation immigrants living in Johnstown during the Great Depression in her first novel, ''A Letter to Mrs. Roosevelt'' (2000).

The film &quot;The Johnstown Flood&quot;, written and directed by [[Charles Guggenheim]], won the [[Academy Award]] for Best Documentary, Short Subject in 1989. The film was commissioned by the Johnstown Flood Museum Association, which later reorganized as the Johnstown Area Heritage Association, and is shown every hour at the Johnstown Flood Museum.

[[Detective fiction|Mystery]] [[novel]] writer [[Carl Kosak|K.C. Constantine]] fictionalized many elements of Johnstown and its culture as &quot;Rocksburg&quot; in his novels, although the nearby city of [[Greensburg, Pennsylvania]] also provides some of the lore for Rocksburg.

In 2000, [[Kathleen Cambor]] published ''In Sunlight, In A Beautiful Garden''. The novel followed its characters through the events leading up to and including the 1889 flood. Although the protagonists in the novel were fictional, several historical figures, such as [[Andrew Mellon]], [[Henry Clay Frick]] and Daniel Morrell were also depicted in the book.

Author [[James Patterson]] had his fictional serial kidnapper, Gary Soneji, from ''[[Along Came A Spider]]'' stopping at a convenience store on his way through Johnstown, Pennsylvania. Author [[David Morrell]] had his fictional character &quot;Eliot&quot; recruit two brothers from an orphanage in Johnstown to train as assassins in ''[[Brotherhood of the Rose]]''.

In 1978's haunting film ''[[Dawn of the Dead]]'', a character mentions that they are flying over Johnstown, Pennsylvania, and quips that the people are actually entertained by the zombie outbreak. [[George A. Romero]] filmed the majority of the zombie movie at the [[Monroeville, Pennsylvania|Monroeville]] Mall, some 50-odd miles away.

In 2007, singer-songwriter [[Will Hawkins (musician)|Will Hawkins]] released a song entitled &quot;Johnstown&quot; on his album ''Ghost Town''. The song's protagonist was a reservist returning home from the Iraq War and coming to terms with a life without a limb. The song was inspired by actual reservists from Johnstown whom Hawkins met during a USO sponsored performance at Walter Reed Army Hospital in Washington D.C.

In addition to international radio play, the song was also featured prominently in John Murtha's 2007 re-election campaign for the seat he held in the House of Representatives for almost 30 years. Hawkins toured extensively raising funds and awareness for the Intrepid Fallen Heros Fund that donated directly to injured soldiers who were left without health benefits.

Johnstown is featured in ''Defenders of Freedom Volume 1'' (2010) and ''Defenders of Freedom Volume 2'' (2012).  Both are hardcover books, published by the Williamsport Sun-Gazette, featuring first person stories of Lycoming County, Pennsylvania, military veterans who served in World War II, Korea and Vietnam. In the foreword of each volume, Johnstown native and nationally recognized newspaper publisher, Bernard A. Oravec, shares stories of his father's military police service in Germany and growing up in Johnstown's west end during the 1970s.

Johnstown is also hometown of [[Electronic dance music|EDM]] artist Steve Philibin.

Johnstown has been home to a long succession of minor league [[ice hockey|hockey]] [[Sports franchising|franchises]] dating back to 1940. The most recent manifestation, the [[Johnstown Chiefs]], were named for their ''[[Slap Shot (movie)|Slap Shot]]'' counterparts. The team made their [[ECHL]] debut in 1988. The team announced in February 2010 that they would be leaving Johnstown for a location in South Carolina.  In April 2010 it was announced that the [[Wheeling Nailers]] of the ECHL would call Johnstown home for 10 games during the regular season and for one of their preseason games.  They will be returning once again for the 2011-12 season.

The city also has a rich history in amateur and professional baseball. Since 1944, Johnstown has been known as the host city for the AAABA Baseball Tournament held each summer. Several [[Major League Baseball]] players have played on AAABA teams over the years, including Hall-of Famers [[Al Kaline]] and [[Reggie Jackson]] and current Major League managers [[Joe Torre]] and [[Bruce Bochy]]. The organization also has its own Hall of Fame instituted in its 50th anniversary year of 1994.

In addition, the city has hosted several incarnations of a Minor League Baseball team, the [[Johnstown Johnnies]], beginning in 1884. The last team to play as the Johnnies, as a part of the [[Frontier League]], left the city in 2002.

== History ==
During the [[French and Indian War]], a British army commanded by [[General Edward Braddock]] approached [[Fort Duquesne]] and crossed the Youghiogheny River at Stewart's Crossing, which is situated in the middle of what is now the City of Connellsville.

Connellsville was officially founded as a township in 1793 then as a borough on March 1, 1806 by [[Zachariah Connell]], a militia captain during the American Revolution. In February 1909, balloting in New Haven and Connellsville resulted in these two boroughs joining and becoming the first city in Fayette County on May 12, 1911.

Due to the city’s location in the center of the [[Connellsville coalfield]], [[coal mining]], coke production, and other accompanying industries became the major sources of employment and revenue during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Connellsville became known at the &quot;Coke Capital of the World&quot; due to the amount and quality of coke produced in the city's many beehive ovens. During this time, Connellsville had more millionaires per capita than any other city in the United States.

==Education==
Connellsville is served by the [[Connellsville Area School District]].

==Media==
''The Daily Courier'', a newspaper based in the city, has been in publication for over a century.

==Parks and trails==
The [[Youghiogheny River Trail]], a part of The [[Great Allegheny Passage]], runs through Connellsville.

==Transportation==
===Railroads===
Connellsville has the distinction of being served at one time by five railroads: the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]], the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]], the [[Western Maryland Railroad]], the [[Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad]], and the [[Norfolk and Western Railroad]].

The Bailtimore and Ohio Railroad (now [[CSX Transportation]]) entered Connellsville on the left side of the Youghiogheny River.  This main line originated in [[Cumberland, MD]] and followed the river to Pittsburgh and eventually [[Chicago, Il]].

The Pennsylvania Railroad's Southwest branch from Greensburg entered Connellsville from Connellsville Township crossing Route 119 and across the North End crossing the Youghiogheny on a tressle in the middle of the town as this line terminated in [[Uniontown, PA]].  This line has been severed and the tressle demolished in the late 80's. It remains as a coal loading facility behind the location of the former Back Creek Lumber Co where the line was severed.  This line is now operated by the [[Southwest Pennsylvania Railroad]].

The Western Maryland Railroad's line crossed over the Alleghenies from [[Cumberland, MD]] and entered Connellsville on the right side of the Youghiogheny river and connected with two separate railroad companies.  The first connection was with the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad's line from Pittsburgh which continued down the right side of the river to Pittsburgh.  This was in direct competition with the B &amp; O directly across the river.  The second connection of the Western Maryland was to the Norfolk and Western railroad which crossed the river to the left side on the former Pittsburgh &amp; West Virginia railroad bridge.

The Norfolk &amp; Western branch was acquired by the [[Wheeling and Lake Erie Railway (1990)|Wheeling and Lake Erie Railroad]] which build a new connection on the left side of the river to CSX which severed the old line across the bridge.  This historic bridge is now threatened with demolition. Several of these former railway lines have been abandoned and the [[Right-of-way (transportation)|right of way]] acquired for other uses.  The former Western Maryland railroad, and Pittsburgh &amp; Lake Erie lines are now the part of the [[Youghiogheny River Trail]].

[[Amtrak]]'s {{Amtrak lines|Capitol Limited}} provides passenger rail service to Connellsville, with service to [[Union Station (Chicago)|Chicago]], [[Pittsburgh]], [[Union Station (Washington)|Washington, DC]], and other points in between.

===Roads===
The main route through Connellsville is [[US 119]]. US 119 links Connellsville with nearby cities Uniontown and Greensburg, and provides access to many of the business on the outskirts of the city. [[PA 201]] ends in Connellsville, and [[PA 711]] serves as the main street through downtown before heading into the local mountains.

==History==

===Early settlement===
[[Charles II of England|Charles II]] granted the land that eventually became Pottsville to [[William Penn]]. The grant comprised all lands west and south of the Delaware and the Schuylkill; therefore the site of Pottsville was originally in [[Chester County, Pennsylvania|Chester County]]. When the legislative Council, on 10 May 1729, enacted the law erecting [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania]], which included all the lands of the Province lying westward of a straight line drawn northeasterly from the headwaters of Octorara Creek (near the southern borders) marked with blazed trees, to the [[Schuylkill River]], then this placed Pottsville in Lancaster County. By enactment of the same Council, approved on 11 March 1752, [[Berks County, Pennsylvania|Berks County]] was erected; this placed Pottsville within the limits of that county.

Pottsville's [[anthracite coal]] history began in 1790 when it was discovered by hunter [[Necho Allen]]. Legend has it that Allen fell asleep at the base of the Broad Mountain, and woke to the sight of a large fire; his campfire had ignited an outcropping of coal. By 1795 an anthracite-fired iron furnace was established on the [[Schuylkill River]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

===19th century===
[[Image:View of Pottsville, Pennsylvania.jpg|thumb|left|View of Pottsville in 1854]]
In 1806 John Pott purchased the furnace. By an act of Assembly of the Commonwealth approved March 1, 1811, the County of Schuylkill was erected out of portions of Berks and Northampton; this placed the site of Pottsville in Schuylkill County. The town was formally laid out in 1816 by a local surveyor, Henry Donnell. Pottsville was established as a village in Norwegian Township in 1819 and incorporated as a borough on February 19, 1828.

In 1829, [[D.G. Yuengling &amp; Son]] established the oldest operated family [[beer]] [[brewery]] in the [[United States]]. In 1851 Pottsville became the county seat, the original county seat being [[Orwigsburg, Pennsylvania|Orwigsburg]].&lt;ref&gt;DC Henning, Esq., ''Early Annals of Pottsville'', September 28, 1906.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Philadelphia and Reading Coal and Iron Company]], which has its roots in the [[Reading Company|Philadelphia and Reading Railway Company]], the remnants of which were acquired in the late 20th century by the [[Reading Anthracite Company]], acquired extentive coal lands and would become one of the most notable of the coal companies operating in Pennsylvania until the demise of the anthracite industry after World War II.

Because of its location along the Schuylkill River, Pottsville developed a small textile industry. Out of this industry grew the [[Phillips Van Heusen]] company which was founded in 1881. Moses Phillips and his wife Endel began sewing shirts by hand and selling them from pushcarts to the local [[coal miners]]. Van Heusen and other textile companies left the region starting in the late 1970s, mainly as a result of foreign competition.  Another element of the textile industry was the Tilt Silk Mill on Twelfth Street, which produced silk from silk worms imported from China which fed on mulberry trees in the building's solarium.  The silk business eventually was eclipsed by the development of nylon stockings.  The building still stands and is presently the headquarters of a storage and vehicle rental business.

===20th century===
[[Image:Pottsville High School - Patterson School - Pottsville, Pennsylvania.jpg|thumb|right|The Patterson Building served as the [[Pottsville Area High School]] from 1916 to 1933&lt;ref&gt;''Pottsville High School Centennial: 1853-1953'', page 8&lt;/ref&gt;]]
During the [[Prohibition]] period in the United States, under the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|18th Amendment]], Yuengling stopped making beer and moved to production of &quot;[[near beer]]&quot;. The three brews produced in this time were the Yuengling Special (the most popular brand), Yuengling Por-Tor (a version of their &quot;celebrated Pottsville Porter&quot;), and finally, the Yuengling Juvo, which was a cereal beverage. Then-owner Frank Yuengling also opened the Yuengling Dairy, which produced ice cream and other dairy products for the local area. These ventures helped to keep the company afloat during that period.

When the 18th Amendment was [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|repealed]], Yuengling stopped production of &quot;near beer&quot; and resumed making alcoholic beverages. The brewery famously sent a truckload of its Winner Beer to the White House in 1933 as thanks to President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] for the [[repeal of Prohibition]]. Yuengling still continues its family-owned business today. It is the second largest American-owned brewery, after the [[Boston Beer Company]], producer of [[Samuel Adams (beer)|Samuel Adams]] beer. The Yuengling Dairy was operated by a different branch of the family from the Brewery. Business declined and the dairy folded as of 1985. Attempted buyouts by large conglomerate [[brewery|breweries]] have all been unsuccessful.

Pottsville was chartered as a third-class [[city]] on March 22, 1911.

Pottsville was host to a [[National Football League]] (NFL) franchise from 1925-1928. The [[Pottsville Maroons]] played in Sportsman's Park (or [[Minersville Park]]) in nearby [[Minersville, Pennsylvania|Minersville]], now the site of King's Village shopping plaza.  The Maroons posted some of the best records in the NFL during the 1925 and 1926 seasons. The Maroons had a claim to the 1925 NFL championship, but [[1925 NFL Championship controversy|because of a controversial decision]] by NFL President Joe Carr, the title was instead awarded to the [[Chicago Cardinals]]. The Maroons suffered two more losing seasons before relocating to Boston and becoming the [[Boston Bulldogs (NFL)|Boston Bulldogs]]. The Bulldogs folded in 1929.

Until the middle of the 20th century, Pottsville was a popular destination for many traveling acts and vaudeville performers.  The 1929 film [[Berth Marks]] stars the comedy legends [[Laurel and Hardy]] as they attempt to reach Pottsville by train for one of their booked performances.  [[Pearl Bailey]] had once resided in Pottsville during the early part of her entertaining career.  Soldiers in training at nearby [[Fort Indiantown Gap]] were prohibited from visiting Pottsville during most of World War II due to the large amounts of illicit venues and activities present during the time.   

In August 1997, the Pottsville Railway Park Little League all star team, managed by 42-year veteran Irv Shappell, made an impressive run to the Little League World Series in [[Williamsport, Pennsylvania]] by representing the U.S. East Region.  The team glided through the Pennsylvania District 24 Tournament including defeating their cross-town rival Pottsville Rotary Little League 19-0.  Following the District 24 Tournament Railway Park continued its impressive run through the PA Section 3 Tournament beating every team they played.  Moving on to the Pennsylvania State Tournament which was held in [[Carbondale, PA]]; they suffered their first loss of the tournament to Berwyn-Paoli Little League only to bounce back the next night to win the State Crown which earned them a berth in the U.S. Eastern Region Tournament in [[Bristol, Connecticut]].  Defeating [[Connecticut]] twice, as well as teams from [[Rhode Island]], [[Maine]], and [[New Jersey]] they played their final game before the Series against California-Hollywood, [[Maryland]], defeating them 2-1 in a LIVE-televised game on [[ESPN2]].  Finally, in Williamsport for the World Series they defeated [[Dyer, Indiana]] 1-0 in an extra inning game.  The following evening they played [[Bradenton, Florida]] at Lamade Stadium before the largest crowd ever to watch a Non-championship game.  The crowd was estimated at more than 35,000.  Although they lost the game they played their final game against Mission Viejo, Southern California, losing to that team 3-1; one game shy of the United States Championship Game.  The team returned home to a city-wide party and more than 200 fire trucks welcomed them back to town.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

===21st century===
Today Pottsville is on the verge of revitalizing the downtown area.  The city completed in 2007 a streetscaping project on Centre Street.  In addition, the city plans on using the funds from the Elm Street project to revitalize Nichols Street.  The city also is working on bringing the railroad back into center city for tourist excursions. In June 2011, the City of Pottsville became the county's transportation hub for [http://www.go-sts.com/ STS (Schuylkill Transportation System)] bus service throughout the county with the $16.1 million Union Station Intermodal Transit Center at 300 S. Centre Street.&lt;ref&gt;Pytak, Stephen J. 'Union Station, Kohl's among business spurs in 2011.' The Pottsville Republican and Evening Herald. http://republicanherald.com/news/union-station-kohl-s-among-business-spurs-in-2011-1.1251565 Accessed January 30, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  It will also accommodate Trailways and Greyhound bus services.  Union Station plans to eventually incorporate a train station in the current Union Street Parking Lot.

Pottsville is also the home to the Great Pottsville Cruise which is held on the second Sunday of August each year.  The Great American Way Fair is also held annually in early May.  Each New Year's Eve the city sponsors the raising of the Yuengling Bottle to the top of the flagpole at Garfield Square to ring in the new year.

The [[Pottsville Downtown Historic District]], [[Cloud Home]], [[John O'Hara House]], [[Burd Patterson House]], [[Pottsville Armory]], [[Yuengling|D.G. Yuengling and Son Brewing Complex]], and [[Frank D. Yuengling Mansion]] are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nris&quot;&gt;{{NRISref|version=2010a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==

=== Topography ===
Pottsville is located at {{Coord|40.685058|-76.202747|type:city_region:US|format=dms|display=inline}} (40.685058, -76.202747).{{GR|1}}

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|4.20|sqmi|km2}}.It is all land; none of the area is covered in water.  Although there are no lakes within the city there are several water courses which flow through the city.  The Schuylkill River flows through the extreme southern part of the city near Mount Carbon.  The West Branch of the Schuylkill River makes up the western border for the city.  Within the city itself the West Branch of Norwegian Creek flows through the Fishbach section of the city and the East Branch of Norwegian Creek flows through the Jalappa section of the city.  Joining together near Progress Avenue and Terry Reiley Way they form Norwegian Creek which flows underground through the heart of the city.  The creek empties into the Schuylkill River at Mauch Chunk Street.

Pottsville is said to rest on seven hills, like ancient Rome.  These seven hills are Lawton's Hill, Greenwood Hill, Bunker Hill (Sharp Mountain), Guinea Hill, Forest Hills, Cottage Hill and Mount Hope.

'''Farrell''' is a city in [[Mercer County, Pennsylvania|Mercer County]], Pennsylvania, [[United States]]. The population was 5,111 at the 2010 census. It is part of the [[Youngstown, Ohio|Youngstown]]&amp;ndash;[[Warren, Ohio|Warren]]&amp;ndash;[[Boardman, Ohio|Boardman]], [[Ohio|OH]]-PA [[Youngstown-Warren-Boardman, OH-PA Metropolitan Area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]].

==History==
Once dubbed &quot;The Magic City,&quot; Farrell sprung up practically overnight when a steel mill was constructed in 1901 on a plain bordering the [[Shenango River]] in what was then part of Hickory Township (now [[Hermitage, Pennsylvania|Hermitage]]). 

The community was incorporated as the Borough of South Sharon in 1916; its population peaked at over 15,000 in 1920 and its status was elevated to a third-class city in 1932.  At that time the residents of the new city elected to take the name of Farrell, after industrialist [[James A. Farrell]].&lt;ref&gt;
( ''Farrell Golden Jubilee'' 1901-1951.)&lt;/ref&gt;

The mill, which eventually became known as the Roemer Works of [[Sharon Steel Corporation]], would serve as the community's lifeblood until 1992, when it was liquidated after filing bankruptcy.  Many of the assets were sold at auction to Britain-based Caparo Corp. and later to Swiss steelmaker Duferco, which operates the plant today. Farrell was designated a [[Financially Distressed Municipalities Act|financially distressed municipality]] in 1987 by the state of Pennsylvania.

Despite years of population and industrial decline, Farrell has made progress in rebuilding itself due to new industrial investments on tax abated land and several new housing starts. {{Citation Needed|date=November 2011}}

The city of Shamokin is bordered by its sister community, [[Coal Township, Pennsylvania]], and by the world's largest man-made mountain, the Glen Burn Colliery Cameron Culm Bank.  The colliery was in operation until the 1970s and was left abandoned.

==History==

Shamokin was incorporated as a [[borough (Pennsylvania)|borough]] on November 9, 1864, and as a city on February 21, 1949. In addition to [[anthracite]] coal-mining, it also had silk and knitting mills (the Eagle Silk Mill became the largest textile building under one roof in America), stocking and shirt factories, wagon shops, ironworks, and brickyards.

Most notably, [[Thomas Edison]], briefly a resident of Sunbury, established the [[Edison Illuminating Company]] of Shamokin in the fall of 1882. Operation of the Shamokin station (located at the current Independence Street site of Jones Hardware Company&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joneshardware.com/ace.htm |title=History of Jones Hardware and Home Center |publisher=Joneshardware.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;) on September 22, 1883, at which time [[St. Edward's Catholic Church]] became the first church in the world to have electric lighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nungesser/Thomas/ThomasStudio/Edison.htm |first=Garth |last=Hall |newspaper=The News-Item |location=Shamokin, PA |title=Thomas Edison, known world-wide as one of the most prolific inventors in history, held 1,097 U |publisher=Freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[1877 Shamokin Uprising]], starvation wages and miserable working conditions prompted railroad workers and miners to join the [[Great Railroad Strike of 1877]]. Vigilantes gathered by Mayor William Douty shot into a group of strikers, wounding twelve and killing two. Five strikers were jailed for up to eight months for their part in the uprising.

The National Ticket Company, located in Shamokin from 1907 until 1992, was at one time the largest ticket company in the United States. Their first production facility was built in 1911 at the corner of Pearl and Webster Streets; a 1942 fire gutted the plant, although the brick shell still stands. The replacement building at Pearl Street and Ticket Avenue was completed in 1950 and served as company headquarters for forty-two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalticket.com/general/history.asp |title=National Ticket- History}}{{dead link|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
&quot;Murder at Hickory Ridge&quot; was a fictionalized account of an unsolved murder in the Shamokin area, written by William A. Conway and printed by his two brothers, Alphonsus E. and John J., in the garage that served as the Conway Print Shop.
 
With the profits from the sale of the novel, the Conway brothers started the Black Diamond Publishing Company in 1905 to disseminate news of the anthracite coal region through the printing of Black Diamond Magazine. 

Edgewood park also known as Indian Park existed in Shamokin from 1905 through the late 1950s. It consisted of {{convert|97|acre|m2}} including a large pond. The land where the park existed is now where the Shamokin area school district built the Elementary and High school.

The [[Victoria Theatre (Shamokin, Pennsylvania)|Victoria Theatre]] was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1985.  It was delisted in 2004, after demolition.&lt;ref name=&quot;nris&quot;&gt;{{NRISref|version=2010a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|0.8|sqmi|km2}}, all of it land.

Shamokin has two small creeks that divide the town. Carbon Run merges with Shamokin Creek in the north of the town and ultimately empties into the [[Susquehanna River]] just south of [[Shamokin Dam]] near [[Sunbury, PA]].

'''York''' ([[Pennsylvania German language|Deitsch]]: ''Yarrick''), known as '''the White Rose City''' (after the [[White Rose of York|symbol of the House of York]]), is a city located in [[York County, Pennsylvania|York County]], Pennsylvania, United States, which is in the [[South Central Pennsylvania|South Central]] region of the state. The population within the city limits was 43,718 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], which was a 7.0% increase from the 2000 count of 40,862. When combined with the adjacent boroughs of [[West York, Pennsylvania|West York]] and [[North York, Pennsylvania|North York]] and surrounding [[Spring Garden Township, York County, Pennsylvania|Spring Garden]], [[West Manchester Township, York County, Pennsylvania|West Manchester]], and [[Springettsbury Township, York County, Pennsylvania|Springettsbury]] townships, the population of Greater York is 108,386.

==18th century==
[[File:Golden Plow York PA.JPG|thumb|left|York's Golden Plough Tavern]]
York, also known as Yorktown in the mid 18th to early 19th century, was founded in 1741 by settlers from the [[Philadelphia]] region, and named for the [[York|English city]] of the same name.  By 1777, most of the area residents were of either German or Scots-Irish descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Glatfelter |first=Charles H |title=The Continental Congress Meets a German Town |url=http://www.hsp.org/default.aspx?id=492 |work=hsp.org |publisher=The Historical Society of Pennsylvania |accessdate=June 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  York was incorporated as a [[borough]] on September 24, 1787, and as a city on January 11, 1887. During the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775–1783), York served as the temporary capital of the [[Continental Congress]]. The [[Articles of Confederation]] were drafted and adopted in York, though they would not be ratified until March 1781.

York styles itself the first [[List of capitals in the United States#Former national capitals|Capital of the United States]], although historians generally consider it to be the fourth capital, after [[Philadelphia]], [[Baltimore]] and [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url = http://www.straightdope.com/columns/041210.html
|title = The Straight Dope: York, Pennsylvania: First capital of the United States?
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The claim arises from the assertion that the Articles of Confederation was the first legal document to refer to the colonies as &quot;the United States of America&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The argument depends on whether the [[Declaration of Independence]], which also uses the term, would be considered a true legal document of the United States, being drafted under and in opposition to British rule. This does not, however, prevent modern businesses and organizations in the York area, such as the [http://www.firstcapitaldispensing.com First Capital Dispensing Co.], [http://www.fcap.com First Capital Engineering] and  [http://www.firstcapitalfcu.com First Capital Federal Credit Union] from using the name.

The [[Conway Cabal]], a political intrigue against General [[George Washington]], had its origins in the [[Golden Plough Tavern]] in York.&lt;ref&gt;McClure, James, ''Nine Months in York Town''. (York, Pennsylvania: York Daily Record, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

==19th century==
According to U.S. census reports from 1800 through 1840, York ranked within the nation's top 100 most populous urban areas.

[[File:Wm Goodridge House.JPG|thumb|right|Home of William C. Goodridge, a successful black businessman who ran an [[Underground Railway]] station]]
During the [[American Civil War]] (1861–1865), York became the largest [[Northern United States|Northern]] town to be occupied by the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate army]] when the [[Division (military)|division]] of [[Major General]] [[Jubal Anderson Early]] spent June 28–30, 1863, in and around the town while the [[brigade]] of [[John Brown Gordon|John B. Gordon]] marched to the [[Susquehanna River]] at [[Wrightsville, Pennsylvania|Wrightsville]] and back. Early laid York under tribute and collected food, supplies, clothing, shoes, and $28,000 in cash from citizens and merchants before departing westward obeying the revised orders of [[Robert E. Lee]]. The sprawling [[York U.S. Army Hospital]] on Penn Commons served thousands of Union soldiers wounded at the battles of [[Battle of Antietam|Antietam]] and [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]].&lt;ref&gt;Mingus, Scott L., ''Flames Beyond Gettysburg: The Gordon Expedition, June 1863.'' (Columbus, Ohio: Ironclad Publishing, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Postbellum]] era (1865–1877), York remained a regional center for local agriculture, but increasingly became an important industrial center, with such industries as [[steam engine]]s, railroad manufacturing, and papermaking coming to the forefront. York also features some unique architecture ranging from colonial era buildings to large gothic churches.

==20th century==
[[Image:Pullman.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Six-wheeled Pullman Automobile]]
The York Motor Car Co. built [[Pullman automobile]]s on North George St. from 1905 thorough 1917. An early and unique six-wheeled prototype was involved in one of the city's first known automobile accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ydr.inyork.com/ntbf/ci_4336810 |title= 1903: York County; Six-wheeled car crashes |accessdate=April 17, 2008 |date=September 14, 2006 |publisher=York Daily Record / Sunday News }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another model was driven to San Francisco and back over about one month to prove its reliability several years before the creation of the [[Lincoln Highway]] which ran through town, connecting New York and San Francisco.

The York area had also been home for more than 100 years to the [[Pfaltzgraff]] company, which built its first [[pottery]] factory in the area in 1895 and continued manufacturing in York until 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==21st century==
The city of York experienced many noteworthy achievements and embarrassments to start the 21st century.

In 2002, the city faced a budget shortfall of $1,000,000.  [[Mayor of York, Pennsylvania|Mayor]] [[John S. Brenner]]'s plan to raise the money by asking York County's 302,000 adult residents to donate $3.32 to the city received national attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
|url = http://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/21/us/national-briefing-mid-atlantic-pennsylvania-mayor-seeks-3-donations.html?scp=4&amp;sq=York,%20Pennsylvania%20&amp;%20Brenner&amp;st=cse

|date = December 21, 2002
|work=New York Times
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The plan, referred to by some as the &quot;Big Mac&quot; Plan, did not raise all the moneys sought.

After many years of attempting to secure funding for a stadium and a baseball team to play in it, the first decade of the century saw York realize both goals. In 2007, [[Santander Stadium]], home of the [[York Revolution]], opened in the Arch Street neighborhood.  The stadium, along with other large projects such as the York County Judicial Center and the Codo 241 luxury apartment lofts, symbolizes York's extensive redevelopment efforts.

York was featured during the 2008 U.S. Presidential Election, when [[National Public Radio]]'s [[Michele Norris]] and [[Steve Inskeep]] chose to showcase the city in &quot;The York Project: Race &amp; the '08 Vote.&quot;  The program was aired as a 7-part series and featured different York citizens discussing race relations, racial perceptions, and the emotions inspired by the 2008 election.  Norris stated that York was chosen due to its central location in a battleground state, its rich history (including its strained race relations), and demographics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The [[York County Heritage Trust]] (YCHT) is a not-for-profit educational institution that preserves and uses its collections, historic sites and museums to inspire people to explore the history and culture of York County, Pennsylvania. YCHT maintains eight historical sites that preserve and present 300 years of York County's rich and diverse history.  The YCHT was founded in 1999 after a merger of the Historical Society of York County and the Agricultural and Industrial Museum of York County (AIM). Currently, the YCHT historical sites include the Worker's House (c. 1875), Golden Plough Tavern (c.1741), the Barnett Bobb Log House (1812), the Bonham House (c.1885) and old Eastern Market House (c.1886). In 1992, AIM acquired an industrial complex consisting of six buildings (c.1874 to 1955); three of the buildings were renovated and now house the industrial portion of the collection. The YCHT also hosts a variety of events throughout the year. The YCHT also holds the rights to the [[Murals of York, PA]], a group of murals that depict York's rich history.

===Baseball===
The [[York Revolution]] plays in the independent [[Atlantic League of Professional Baseball]]. After 36 years without professional baseball, the Revolution arrived in 2007 to fill the void left by the departed [[York White Roses]].  The Revolution are named after the city's colonial past, when the [[Continental Congress]] met in York and passed the [[Articles of Confederation]] during the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]]. The Revolution continue the old baseball rivalry between York and the nearby city of [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lancasterbarnstormers.com/news.cfm?newsID=229 |title=Opening Shots Fired in &quot;War of the Roses&quot; : Lancaster, York To Renew Storied Baseball Rivalry |accessdate=August 6, 2008 |work=lancasterbarnstormers.com |publisher=Lancaster Barnstormers &amp; Keystone Baseball |date=April 4, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Revolution play at [[Sovereign Bank Stadium]] in York's Arch Street neighborhood. The stadium features a plaza and statue in honor of [[MLB]] [[Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] third baseman [[Brooks Robinson]], a one-time member of the aforementioned White Roses, with whom he made his professional baseball debut in 1955. Robinson currently serves as a special assistant and advisor to [[Opening Day Partners]], the group largely responsible for bringing professional baseball back to York.

[[Sovereign Bank Stadium]] has the distinction of having the tallest wall in baseball. At 37 feet, 8&amp;nbsp;inches, the left field wall of York's ballpark surpasses the height of the [[Green Monster]] at [[Fenway Park]], the home of the [[Boston Red Sox]].

===Football===
The people of York (the ''White Rose City'') and the similar city of [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]] (the ''Red Rose City'') across the [[Susquehanna River]] often engage in rivalry and competition that has its roots in the [[Wars of the Roses]]. Both cities take their names from the English cities, [[York]] and [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]], from which the opposing [[royal houses]] took their names in the 15th century wars.

The War of the Roses All-Star Game is played in York every year over the weekend of [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]]. The game pits the best high school football players in their senior seasons from the York-[[Adams County, Pennsylvania|Adams]] League against a similar team from the Lancaster-[[Lebanon County, Pennsylvania|Lebanon]] League. As the game only involves seniors and occurs during the first weekend of the PIAA District 3 football playoffs (players on teams which qualify for the playoffs do not participate), it is the final high school football game for each of the participants.

==Media==
[[File:York Dispatch.JPG|thumb|right|The old York Dispatch Building]]
York is unusual in that it supports two daily newspapers, despite its relatively small size. The ''[[York Daily Record|York Daily Record/Sunday News]]'' is published mornings, seven days a week, and ''[[The York Dispatch]]'' is published Monday through Friday afternoons. The Daily Record/Sunday News currently has the lead in terms of circulations of the daily newspapers.

The York area is part of the [[Susquehanna Valley]] ([[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]]/[[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]]/[[Lebanon, Pennsylvania|Lebanon]]/[[York, PA|York]]) media market. Of the major television network affiliates in this [[media market]], only one, the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliate [[WPMT]], has its base of operations in York. Other stations in the market include [[NBC]] Affiliate [[WGAL]], from Lancaster, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate [[WHTM-TV]], [[CBS]] Affiliate [[WHP-TV]], [[The CW Television Network|CW]] Affiliate [[WLYH]], and [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] member [[WITF-TV]], all from Harrisburg. It is also not uncommon for York residents to receive some stations from the [[Baltimore]], Maryland media market, due to its proximity to the south of York.

York has a [[Public, educational, and government access]] (PEG) cable TV station called WRCT (White Rose Community Television) wrct.tv [http://wrct.tv] which used to be YCAT ([[York Community Access Television]]).&lt;ref&gt;Leonardi, Joe.

The pop music radio station, [[WSBA AM]] 910, achieved high ratings in not only York, but also in nearby Harrisburg and Lancaster, during the 1960s and 1970s. WSBA, now a news-talk station, was well known for being the flagship station of [[Susquehanna Broadcasting]], which had its corporate offices in York, as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.suscom.com/about/pfaltzgraff.php Susquehanna Communications: ''About SusCom'']&lt;/ref&gt;

York's &quot;98 YCR&quot; was once a very popular pop music station with DJ [[Captain Connors]].  The radio station has since switched formats to classic 60s, 70s, and 80s music.  Now calling itself &quot;The Peak&quot; 98.5 &quot;York's Classic Hits&quot;, [[WYCR]] remains popular, but with older generations.

Other radio stations in York include [[WVYC]] from York College, [[WARM-FM|WARM FM]], [[WQXA-FM|WQXA FM]], and [[WOYK]].

==Transportation==
York is served, through public transportation, by [[Rabbit Transit (York)|Rabbit Transit]], which operates multiple bus routes in the city and the surrounding suburbs. In 2006 a rabbitEXPRESS bus route was established to transport commuters to [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]] and back, making six round trips weekdays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

''The (Baltimore) Daily Record''. November 20, 2006. ''Retrieved on May 3, 2007''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Rabbit Transit the city has a Greyhound/Trailways bus depot where service through Harrisburg to [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], or to Baltimore and Washington, D.C. is provided by [[Greyhound Lines]]. Service through Lancaster to [[Philadelphia]] and New York City is provided by [[Trailways Transportation System|Capitol Trailways]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Rail enthusiasts have suggested commuter rail service could be started between York and Philadelphia with much of the necessary infrastructure already in place, using SEPTA's system. Transportation planners say this is too expensive, with bus and van services more feasible.&lt;ref&gt;Klimanis, Daina. &quot;[http://www.yorkdispatch.com/local/ci_5765496 York transportation panel says light rail too costly]&quot;. ''The York Dispatch''. April 27, 2007. ''Retrieved on May 3, 2007''.&lt;/ref&gt;  The former Pennsylvania Railroad station for York now lies along the [[York County Heritage Rail Trail]] across from the baseball park.

York does not have any commercial airports, though the small [[York Airport (Pennsylvania)|York Airport]] (THV) is located 7 miles southwest in [[Thomasville, Pennsylvania|Thomasville]].  Many residents use either [[Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport|Baltimore-Washington International]] (BWI) or [[Harrisburg International Airport]] (MDT).

[[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]], 24 miles to the east, has frequent [[Amtrak]] train service to Philadelphia.

'''Bethlehem''' is a city in [[Lehigh County, Pennsylvania|Lehigh]] and [[Northampton County, Pennsylvania|Northampton Counties]] in the [[Lehigh Valley]] region of eastern [[Pennsylvania]], in the United States. As of the 2010 census, the city had a total population of 74,982, making it the seventh largest city in Pennsylvania, after [[Philadelphia]], [[Pittsburgh]], [[Allentown, Pennsylvania|Allentown]], [[Erie, Pennsylvania|Erie]], [[Reading, Pennsylvania|Reading]], and [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://2010.census.gov/news/releases/operations/cb11-cn74.html.csv U.S. Census Bureau, 2010. Retrieved 25 March 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt; Of this, 55,639 were in Northampton County, and 19,343 were in Lehigh County.

Bethlehem lies in the center of the Lehigh Valley, a region of &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;731&amp;nbsp;square miles&amp;nbsp;(1,893&amp;nbsp;km²)&lt;/span&gt; that is home to more than 800,000 people.  The Valley embraces a trio of cities (Bethlehem, [[Allentown, Pennsylvania|Allentown]] and [[Easton, Pennsylvania|Easton]]) within two counties (Lehigh and Northampton), making it Pennsylvania's third-largest [[metropolitan area]]. Smaller than Allentown but larger than Easton, Bethlehem is the Lehigh Valley's second most populous city. 

There are four general sections of the city: central Bethlehem, the south side, the east side, and the west side. Each of these sections blossomed at different times in the city's development and each contains areas recognized under the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. Zip codes that use the address Bethlehem totaled 116,000 in population in the year 2000. These zip codes include [[Bethlehem Township, Northampton County, Pennsylvania|Bethlehem Township]].

In July 2006, ''[[Money (magazine)|Money]]'' magazine placed Bethlehem as number 88 on its &quot;Top 100 Best Places to Live.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/moneymag/bplive/2006/top100/index4.html | work=CNN | title=MONEY Magazine: Best places to live 2006: Top 100 76–100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Colonial Industrial Quarter-Bethlehem, Pa..jpg|left|thumb|The Colonial Industrial Quarter on the east bank of Monocacy Creek in Bethlehem.]]
The areas along the Delaware River and its tributaries in eastern Pennsylvania were long inhabited by [[indigenous peoples]] of various cultures.  By the time of European contact, these areas were the historic territory of the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]-speaking [[Lenape Nation]], which had two main language families, the [[Delaware languages|Unami]] and the [[Munsee]].  They traded with the Dutch and then English colonists in the mid-Atlantic area.

On Christmas Eve in 1741, [[David Nitschmann der Bischof|David Nitschmann]] and Count Nicolaus von [[Zinzendorf]], leading a small group of [[Moravian Church|Moravians]], founded the [[Mission (Christian)|mission]] community of Bethlehem along the banks of the [[Monocacy Creek (Lehigh River)|Monocacy Creek]] by the [[Lehigh River]] in the colony of [[Pennsylvania]]. They came to set up missionary communities among the Native Americans and unchurched German-speaking Christians. They named the settlement after the town of [[Bethlehem]] in Judea, the birthplace of Jesus. &quot;Count Zinzendorf said, 'Brothers, how more fittingly could we call our new home than to name it in honor of the spot where the event we now commemorate took place. We will call this place Bethlehem.' And so was Bethlehem named after the birthplace of the Man of Peace.'&quot; (from a letter by Gordon Dent to Mr. T. Donald Bain March 3, 1965 quoting from &quot;Story of Bethlehem Steel&quot; by Arundel Cotter, more details are given in this article) Originally it was a typical Moravian Settlement Congregation, where the Church owned all the property.  Until the 1850s, only members of the Moravian Church were permitted to lease land plots in Bethlehem.  The historic Brethren's House, Sisters' House, Widows' House and ''[[Gemeinhaus-Lewis David De Schweinitz Residence|Gemeinhaus]]'' (Congregation House) with the Old Chapel are remnants of this period of communal living.

The Moravians ministered to regional Lenape [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] through their mission in the area, as well as further east in the New York colony.  In the historic Bethlehem [[God's Acre]] cemetery, converted Lenape lie buried alongside the Moravians.

In 1762, Bethlehem built the first water-works in America to pump water for public use. While [[George Washington]] and his troops stayed in [[Valley Forge]], Washington stored his personal effects at the farm of James Burnside in Bethlehem – {{as of | 1998 | lc = on}} a historical museum (Burnside Plantation).&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20040709174002/http://www.tnonline.com/archives/news/1998_weeklies/09.23/lehigh/briefs.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The prosperous village was incorporated into a free borough in the County of Northampton in 1845.  After the Unity Synod of 1848, Bethlehem became the headquarters of the Northern Province of the Moravian Church in North America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moravian.org/history/ &quot;Moravian Church in North America: Our History&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 27, 1900, [[the Bach Choir of Bethlehem]] presented the United States debut of German [[Lutheran]] [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s [[Mass in B Minor]] in the city's Central Moravian Church.

=== Boroughs merge ===
After the [[American Civil War|civil war]] the Borough of South Bethlehem was formed. In 1886 the Borough of West Bethlehem (in Lehigh county) was formed. In 1904, the Boroughs of West Bethlehem (in Lehigh County) and Bethlehem (in Northampton County) merged. In 1917, the Borough of South Bethlehem and Bethlehem merged to become the City of Bethlehem. [[Bethlehem Township, Pennsylvania]] has remained a separate political entity. Even after the merger of the two boroughs, the bureau initially provided a count for the original sections.

=== Bethlehem Steel ===
[[File:Bethlehem steel c.1896.jpg|thumb|400px|The [[Blast furnace]]s of Bethlehem Steel seen in a panoramic view from the north bank of the [[Lehigh River]]. South Mountain is in the distance. (c.1896).]]

Bethlehem became a center of heavy industry and trade during the [[industrial revolution]]. The [[Bethlehem Steel|Bethlehem Steel Corporation]] (1857–2003), founded and based in Bethlehem, was once the second-largest steel producer in the United States, after [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]-based [[U.S. Steel]]. Bethlehem Steel was also one of the largest [[shipbuilding]] companies in the world and one of the most powerful symbols of American industrial manufacturing leadership.

Bethlehem Steel began producing the first wide-flange structural shapes made in the United States and they pioneered the production of the now-ubiquitous &quot;I-beam&quot; used in construction of steel-framed buildings, including skyscrapers. It manufactured construction materials for numerous New York and other city skyscrapers, as well as for major bridges.

The company became a major supplier of [[armor]] plate and ordnance products during [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], including the manufacture of 1,100 [[warship]]s. After roughly 140 years of metal production at its Bethlehem plant, Bethlehem Steel ceased operations there in 1995. Overseas competition and declining demand had ended the business.

=== Christmas star ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2011}}

On December 7, 1937, at a grand ceremony during the [[Great Depression]], Mrs. Marion Brown Grace pulled a large switch to turn on the new Christmas street lights and a large wooden star. Mrs. Grace was the daughter of former South Bethlehem burgess, Charles F. Brown, and wife of Eugene Grace, President of [[Bethlehem Steel]] Corporation. Hundreds of citizens attended the ceremony and thousands more listened to the speeches and musical performances on the radio. This was the first year the Bethlehem [[Chamber of Commerce]] adopted the nickname &quot;Christmas City, USA&quot;.

The Hotel Bethlehem was chosen for the ceremony because it was built on the site of the first building in Bethlehem – a two-room log house – where on Christmas Eve 1741, the original settlers conducted their evening worship. As their benefactor, Count Zinzendorf, observed the farm animals that shared the space and listened to them sing the hymn, &quot;Not Jerusalem, But Lowly Bethlehem&quot;, he proclaimed the name of the settlement to be Bethlehem. The people gathered at the 1937 ceremony heard the same words when the Bach Choir sang the old German hymn, &quot;Jesu, Rufe Mich (Jesus, Call Thou Me)&quot;, by Adam Drese.

[[File:Star of Bethlehem Main Street 2382px.jpg|left|thumb|The star of Bethlehem viewed from Main Street at night, in 2007. The Hotel Bethlehem is located on the right side of the street.]]

The ''Bethlehem Globe-Times'' paid for the large wooden star erected on the top of South Mountain, at a cost of $460. The original star was created with four wooden planks, overlapped to create an eight-point star, 60 feet high by 51 feet wide, mounted on two wooden poles, and lit by 150 50-watt light bulbs. The installation of the star was done by [[PPL (utility)|Pennsylvania Power and Light]] and the Bethlehem Water Department. The star was erected on the top of South Mountain, on property owned by the Water Department, located in Lower Saucon Township.

In 1939, the wooden star was replaced with a star made of Bethlehem steel, at a cost of $5,000. It had eight rays, with the main horizontal ray 81 feet wide and the main vertical ray 53 feet high. In 1967, the current star, 91 feet high, was installed on the old steel frame and set in a concrete base 25 feet wide by 5 feet deep. Plexiglas was installed to protect the 250 50-watt light bulbs. In the summer of 2006, the city repaired the base. A crew of municipal electricians changes the bulbs every two years.  Beginning in the mid-1990s, the star was lit from 4:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. until midnight, every day of the year.

During World War II, from 1941 to 1945, none of the Christmas decorations in Bethlehem were lit. City officials said the lit star made &quot;too good of an air raid target&quot;{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} and &quot;during the global strife it didn't seem right for the lights to be all lit up when our boys were out in the darkness fighting for us&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} When lit, the star can be seen from as far as Wind Gap, {{convert|20|mi|km}} away. The star has become an important symbol for Bethlehem.

In December 2006, [[Las Vegas Sands Corp]] was awarded a Category 2 Slot Machine License by the [[Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board]]. LVSC began work on the site, categorized as both the largest [[brownfield]] redevelopment project in the nation and the largest casino development investment made to date in the Commonwealth. Its mission was to create reinvestment and urbanization in the area. At a projected cost of $743 million, the historic [[Bethlehem Steel]] plant is being redeveloped as a fully integrated [[resort]], to include 3,000 slot machines, over 300 luxury hotel rooms, 9 restaurants, {{convert|200000|sqft|m2}} of premium retail outlet shopping, and {{convert|46000|sqft|m2}} of flexible multi-purpose space.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.archive.org/web/20090512030742/http://www.pasands.com/about/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the casino resort company of [[Las Vegas Sands]] began the construction of [[Sands Casino Resort Bethlehem]].

The Bethlehem Steel sides consisted largely of British imported players and also had the distinction of being the first American professional soccer team to play in Europe, which it did during its tour of [[Sweden]] in 1919. The team also won the National Challenge Cup, now called the [[Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup]] after billionaire sports franchise owner [[Lamar Hunt]], five times beginning in 1915, and for the last time in 1926.

'''Carbondale''' is a city in [[Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania|Lackawanna County]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[United States]]. Carbondale is located approximately 15 miles due northeast of the city of [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]] in [[Northeastern Pennsylvania]]. The population was 8,891 at the 2010 census.

The land area that became Carbondale was developed by William and Maurice Wurts, the founders of the [[Delaware and Hudson Canal Company]], during the rise of the [[anthracite coal]] mining industry in the early 19th century. Carbondale was the site of the first deep vein anthracite coal mine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Tablet_Marking_The_Site_of_The_First_Underground_Coal_Mine_in_Carbondale.jpg}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the United States. It was also a major terminal of the [[Delaware and Hudson]] Railroad. 

Like many other cities and towns in the region, Carbondale has struggled with the demise of the once-prominent coal mining industry that had once made the region a haven for immigrants seeking work so many decades ago. Immigrants from Wales, England, Scotland, Ireland, and from throughout continental Europe came to Carbondale in the course of the nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries to work in the anthracite and railroading industries, and, most importantly, to build new lives for themselves and their families.

==Geography==
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], Carbondale has a total area of {{convert|3.2|sqmi|km2}}, all of it land.

==Schools==
For the 2011-2012 school year, there are two schools located within the City of Carbondale. 
*Carbondale Area Elementary (Grades K-6)
*Carbondale Area Jr./Sr. High (Grades 7-12)

The demographic and economic decline beginning in the 1950s with the end of the coal mining industry has left its mark on education. At one time, the City of Carbondale had one public high school, ten public elementary schools, one private Catholic high school, and two private Catholic elementary schools which served a city of just over 23,000 citizens. Over the decades, changes to education, the dramatic population decline down to 8,800 in the 2010 Census, and the disappearance of religious orders have reduced the number of schools to the two mentioned above. Sacred Heart Elementary, formed as a result of the merger between the parochial Mt. Carmel and St. Rose Elementary Schools for the 1998-1999 school year, closed at the end of the 2010-2011 school year and integrated into LaSalle Academy Catholic School in [[Dickson City, Pennsylvania|Dickson City]]. From a peak enrollment in the 1960s of nearly 650 in a K-12 system served in three schools, the school's enrollment has declined to 186.

'''Meadville''' is a city in and the [[county seat]] of [[Crawford County, Pennsylvania|Crawford County]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[United States]].{{GR|2}} The city is within 40 miles of [[Erie, Pennsylvania]] and 90 miles of [[Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]].  It was the first permanent settlement in northwest Pennsylvania.  The population was 13,388 at the [[United States Census 2010|2010 census]].{{GR|6}}  The city of Meadville is part of the [[Meadville, PA Micropolitan Statistical Area]].

== History ==
Meadville was founded on May 12, 1788 by a party of settlers led by David Mead. Its location was chosen well, for it lies at the confluence of [[Cussewago Creek]] and [[French Creek (Allegheny River)|French Creek]], and was only a day's travel by boat to the safety of [[Franklin, PA|Ft. Franklin]]. 

Their settlement was in a large meadow, first cleared by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] led by Chief [[Custaloga]], and well suited for growing [[maize]]. The village Custaloga built here was known as Cussewago.

The neighboring [[Iroquois]] and [[Lenape]] befriended the isolated settlement, but their enemies, including the [[Wyandot people|Wyandot]]s, were not so amiable. The threat of their attacks caused the settlement to be evacuated for a time in 1791.

Around 1800, many of the settlers to the Meadville area came after receiving [[land bounty|land bounties]] for service in the [[Revolutionary War]].  [[Allegheny College]], the second oldest college west of the [[Allegheny Mountains]], was founded in Meadville in 1815 and is the oldest college west of the Allegheny Mountains that has kept its original name.  Meadville became an important transportation center after construction of the [[French Creek Feeder Canal]] in 1837 and of the [[Beaver and Erie Canal]] it connected to at [[Conneaut Lake]] and subsequent railroad development.  

[[Meadville Theological School]] was established in 
1844 by a wealthy businessman and [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] named Harm Jan Huidekoper. It moved to Chicago in 1926.

In the late 18th and early 19th centuries Meadville played a small part in the Underground Railroad helping escaping slaves to freedom. An event in September 1880 led to the end of segregation by race in the state's public schools. At the South Ward schools, Elias Allen tried unsuccessfully to enroll his two children. He appealed to the Crawford County Court of Common Pleas, and Judge Pearson Church declared unconstitutional the 1854 state law mandating separate schools for Negro children. This law was amended, effective July 4, 1881, to prohibit such segregation.&lt;ref&gt;HistoricalMarkers.com [http://www.historicmarkers.com/Pennsylvania/Crawford_County_Pennsylvania/Desegregation_of_Pennsylvania_Schools_PA430] Retrieved on 2008-12-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 19th century, Meadville's economy was also driven by logging, agriculture, and iron production. The [[Talon Corporation]], headquartered in Meadville, played a major role in the development of the [[zipper]]. Since the clothing industry was largely unaffected by the [[Great Depression]], the community saw a population boom at that time. During [[World War II]], the nearby Keystone Ordnance plant brought additional jobs to the area. 

After the war, Meadville's industrial growth continued. Talon remained a major employer, along with the [[Erie Railroad]], American Viscose (later known as Avtex Fibers), Channellock tools, and Dad's Pet Food. In the 1980s, the Great Lakes region saw a decline in heavy industry. By the early 1990s, Channellock and Dad's were the only large companies operating in Meadville. This blow to the local economy was softened by subsequent surge in light industry, mainly tool and die machine shops, earning Meadville the nickname ''Tool City, USA.'' The area has seen growth in the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century. The song &quot;Bittersweet Motel&quot; by Vermont jam band, Phish, was inspired when keyboardist, Page McConnell, left a wedding in Meadville and drove down to the Pittsburgh Airport.

In addition to the [[Meadville Downtown Historic District]], the [[Baldwin-Reynolds House]], [[Bentley Hall]], [[Independent Congregational Church]], [[Dr. J. R. Mosier Office]], [[Roueche House]], [[Ruter Hall]], and [[Judge Henry Shippen House]] are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nris&quot;&gt;{{NRISref|version=2010a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==College==
Meadville is the home of [[Allegheny College]], a [[liberal arts college]] with approximately 2100 students.

'''Titusville''' is a city in [[Crawford County, Pennsylvania|Crawford County]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[United States]]. The population was 5,602 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], and is part of the [[Meadville, PA Micropolitan Statistical Area]]. Titusville is where the &quot;modern oil industry began.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;WDL&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11368/ |title = Titusville, Pennsylvania, 1896 |website = [[World Digital Library]] |date = 1896 |accessdate = 2013-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The area was first settled in 1796 by [[Jonathan Titus]]. Within 14 years, others bought and improved the land lying near him, along the banks of the now-named [[Oil Creek (Allegheny River)|Oil Creek]]. He named the village Edinburg(h), but as the village grew, the settlers began to call this little hamlet Titusville. The village was incorporated as a borough in 1849.

[[Lumber]] was the principal industry with at least 17 sawmills in the area.

The [[Titusville City Hall]] and [[Titusville Historic District (Titusville, Pennsylvania)|Titusville Historic District]] are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nris&quot;&gt;{{NRISref|version=2010a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oil rush===

Titusville was a slow-growing community until the 1850s, when [[petroleum]] was discovered in the region.

Oil was known to exist here, but there was no practical way to extract it. Its main use at that time had been as a medicine for both animals and humans.&lt;ref name=&quot;ABB&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Hendrick |first=Burton J. |chapter=II THE FIRST GREAT AMERICAN TRUST |title=The Age of Big Business |year=1919 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=[[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]] |page=27 |url=http://pds.lib.harvard.edu/pds/view/4521519?n=46&amp;printThumbnails=no |format=PDF |accessdate=August 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the late 1850s Seneca Oil Company (formerly the [[Pennsylvania Rock Oil Company]]) sent Col. [[Edwin L. Drake]], to start drilling on a piece of leased land just south of Titusville near what is now [[Oil Creek State Park]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WDL&quot;/&gt; Drake hired a salt well driller, William A. Smith, in the summer of 1859. They had many difficulties, but on August 27 at the site of an oil spring just south of Titusville, they finally drilled a well that could be commercially successful.

[[Teamster]]s were needed immediately to transport the oil to markets. Transporting methods improved and in 1862 the Oil Creek &amp; Titusville Railroad was built between Titusville and [[Corry, Pennsylvania|Corry]] where it was transferred to other, larger east-west lines. In 1865 pipelines were laid directly to the rail line and the demand for teamsters practically ended. The next year the railroad line was extended south to Petroleum Centre and Oil City. The Union City &amp; Titusville Railroad was built in 1865.  That line became part of the Philadelphia &amp; Erie Railroad in 1871. That fall, President [[U. S. Grant]] visited Titusville to view this important region. 

Other oil-related businesses quickly exploded on the scene. Eight refineries were built between 1862 and 1868. Drilling tools were needed and several iron works were built. Titusville grew from 250 residents to 10,000 almost overnight and in 1866 it incorporated as a city. In 1871, the first oil exchange in the United States was established here.  The exchange moved from the city, but returned in 1881 in a new, brick building before being dissolved in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.explorepahistory.com/hmarker.php?markerId=447 Explorepahistory.com] Accessed August 8, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The first oil [[millionaire]] was Jonathan Watson, a resident of Titusville.  He owned the land where Drake's well was drilled.  He had been a partner in a lumber business prior to the success of the Drake well.  At one time it was said that Titusville had more millionaires per 1,000 population than anywhere else in the world. 

One resident of note was Franklin S. Tarbell whose large Italianate home still stands. He first moved a few miles south in [[Venango County, Pennsylvania|Venango County]] and established a wooden stock tank business. About {{convert|10|mi|km}} southeast of Titusville was another oil boom city, [[Pithole, Pennsylvania|Pithole]]. Oil was discovered in a rolling meadow there in January 1865 and by September 1865 the population was 15,000. But the oil soon ran dry and within four years the city was nearly deserted. Tarbell moved to Titusville in 1870. His daughter, [[Ida M. Tarbell|Ida Minerva Tarbell]], grew up amidst the sounds and smells of the oil industry. She became an accomplished writer and wrote a series of articles about the business practices of the [[Standard Oil Company]] and its president, [[John D. Rockefeller]], which sparked legislative action in Congress concerning monopolies.

Fire was always a fearful concern around oil and one of the worst was on June 11, 1880. It came to be known as &quot;Black Friday,&quot; when almost {{convert|300000|oilbbl|m3}} of oil burned after an oil tank was hit by lightning. The fire raged for three days until it finally was brought under control. Although the oil was valued at $2 million, there was no loss of life. Another fire occurred on June 5, 1892, when Oil Creek flooded and a tank of [[petroleum ether]] overturned. The [[petroleum ether]] ignited and in the ensuing explosions 60 men, women and children died. Another lightning strike in 1894 resulted in {{convert|27000|oilbbl|m3}} lost in a fire. 

Oil production in [[Pennsylvania]] peaked in 1891, when other industries arose in Titusville. The iron and steel industries dominated the town in the early twentieth century with lumber eventually reclaiming its former cachet. Oil is still relevant, however. Charter Plastics Company, now located in a building that once manufactured pressure vessels, stationary engines and boilers for the oil industry, uses oil in its production process.

==Parks and recreation==
The extensive [http://www.sunburylibrary.org/riverfront.htm Sunbury Riverfront Park Project] is in the planning and implementation stages in Sunbury. An extensive floodwall protection system was designed and built by the US Army Corps of Engineers in 1951. Additional height was added to the wall in 2003. The system has provided protection from 15 major flood events over the past 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;Background Information and Data, Sunbury Riverfront Park Project http://www.seda-cog.org/nor-sunbury/lib/nor-sunbury/riverfrontproject/finalmsp/01_background.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, flood waters from Hurricane Agnes crested at {{convert|35.8|ft|m|1}} at Sunbury, two feet higher than the crest in 1936. The wall held back the water and residents showed their gratitude in messages they wrote on the wall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seda-cog.org/nor-sunbury/cwp/view.asp?A=862&amp;Q=428382&amp;tx=1 	 History of Sunbury The flood wall] SEDA-COG, Oct. 12, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hurricane Agnes in late June 1972 was blamed for 10 deaths in Lancaster County, eight in Dauphin County, five in York County and four in both Northumberland and Luzerne counties, according to the [[Susquehanna River Basin Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;Tropical Storm Agnes in the Susquehanna River Basin June 21–24, 1972, Susquehanna River Basin Commission, Information Sheet&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, a multimillion dollar fish ladder is being built across the river in Shamokin Dam to mitigate the impediment of the shad migration up the Susquehanna River that the annual inflation of the Adam T. Bower Fabri Dam causes.&lt;ref&gt;DCNR to Remove Last Impediment to Shad on Susquehanna, http://www.dep.state.pa.us/newsletter/default.asp?NewsletterArticleID=3840&amp;SubjectID=&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Adam T. Bower Memorial Dam]], an inflatable fabric-tube dam barrage impounding the [[Susquehanna River]], creates a {{convert|3,000|acre|km2}}  Augusta Lake for recreation. It is inflated in May and deflated in the fall. The new waterfront development in Sunbury will provide a marina with transient boat docks, walking trails, gardens, an amphitheater and a new accessible fishing pier. In all three acres of land will be added to the river side of the flood wall.

The city offers baseball fields, a skating park, tennis courts, playgrounds, a community pool and a small park that is located next to the county courthouse, in the downtown area.&lt;ref&gt;Public parks of Sunbury http://www.seda-cog.org/nor-sunbury/cwp/view.asp?a=853&amp;q=428179&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pittston''' is a city in [[Luzerne County, Pennsylvania|Luzerne County]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[United States]]. It is situated between [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]] and [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania|Wilkes-Barre]].  The city gained prominence in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as an active anthracite [[coal mining]] city, drawing a large portion of its labor force from [[immigrants|European immigrants]].  The population was 7,739 as of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. At its peak in [[1920 United States Census|1920]], the population of Pittston was 18,497. The city consists of three sections: The [[Downtown]] (in the center of the city), the Oregon Section (in the southern end), and the [[railroad junction|Junction]] (in the northern end).

==History==

===Establishment===
[[File:Pitt.jpg|thumb|150px|left|William Pitt the Elder]]
Pittston lies in the [[Wyoming Valley]] on the east side of the [[Susquehanna River]] and on the south side of the [[Lackawanna River]]. It is approximately midway between [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania|Wilkes-Barre]] and [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]]. Named after the famous British statesman [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt the Elder]], the city was settled around 1770 by the Susquehanna Company of [[Connecticut]]. It was originally called &quot;Pittstown&quot;.

During the [[Revolutionary War]], Connecticut Continentals ([[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriots]]), led by Captain Jeremiah Blanchard and Lieutenant Timothy Keyes, held and maintained a [[fort]] in Pittston. On July 4, 1778 (one day after the [[Battle of Wyoming]]), a group of British soldiers took over the fortress and some of it was destroyed. Two years later, the Continentals stormed the fortification and recaptured it. From then on it was under Patriot control until the end of the war in 1783, with the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]]. Today a [[Historical marker|marker]] stands at the site where the fort once stood.

Pittston broke away from [[Pittston Township, Luzerne County, Pennsylvania|Pittston Township]] and officially became a [[Borough (Pennsylvania)|borough]] in 1853. It was later chartered as a [[city]] on December 10, 1894. Throughout the late 1890s, the city's borders extended from [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]] to [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania|Wilkes-Barre]], but due to financial and civil differences, the city would soon be divided into the many [[Township (Pennsylvania)|township]]s and boroughs that exist throughout the [[Greater Pittston|central Wyoming Valley]] today.

===Coal mining===
[[File:Pittston-1.jpg|thumb|280px|right|Pittston as depicted on an 1892 panoramic map.]]
With the opening of a [[canal]] in the 1830s, Pittston became an important link in the [[coal industry]]. Money made through the mining and transportation of coal led some of the leading merchants to petition its separation from [[Pittston Township, Luzerne County, Pennsylvania|Pittston Township]]. The [[anthracite]] and railroad industry attracted thousands of [[immigration|immigrants]], making Pittston a true [[melting pot]] with once-distinct ethnic and class neighborhoods.

The anthracite coal mining industry, and its extensive use of [[child labor]] in the early part of the 20th century, was one of the industries targeted by the [[National Child Labor Committee]] and its hired photographer, [[Lewis Hine]]. Many of Hine's subjects were photographed in the mines and coal fields in and around Pittston between 1908 and 1912. The impact of the Hine photographs led to the enactment of [[child labor laws]] across the country.

===Mining disasters===
[[File:Knox Mine Flood area from USMSHA report.gif|thumb|left|300|Map of the [[Knox Mine disaster]]. It shows the inundated area and the shafts which were used for escape and dewatering.]]
[[Coal mining]] remained the prominent industry in Pittston for many decades, but disasters did strike on more than one occasion. The first major tragedy occurred in the Newton Coal Company's [[Twin Shaft Disaster|Twin Shaft Mine]] near the city's [[railroad junction]] on June 28, 1896, when a massive cave-in killed 58 miners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=10470 Twin Shaft Disaster Marker]. Hmdb.org. Retrieved on 2013-08-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthracite coal mining remained in Pittston until January 22, 1959, when the [[Knox Mine Disaster]] in nearby [[Port Griffith, Pennsylvania|Port Griffith]] in [[Jenkins Township, Luzerne County, Pennsylvania|Jenkins Township]] ended the industry completely. There, the ice-laden Susquehanna River broke through the roof of the River Slope Mine of the Knox Coal Company, allowing billions of gallons of river water to flood the interconnected mines. Seventy-four miners were trapped; sixty-two miners escaped; twelve miners died and their bodies were never recovered. [[File:76MainStreetPittston.jpg|thumb|right|40|The Flat Iron Building in downtown Pittston during the early 20th century]] The heroic efforts of one miner, Amedeo Pancotti of Pittston, led thirty-two miners to safety. For his efforts, Amedeo Pancotti was awarded the [[Carnegie Hero Fund#Carnegie Medal|Carnegie Medal]] for heroism from the [[Carnegie Hero Fund Commission]].

===City's boom and bust===
[[File:View of Water Street, Pittston, PA.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Water Street in 1908]]
[[File:Lwv pittston1.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Laurel Line in Pittston]]
Pittston became an active [[railroad]] center in response to its mining and industrial activity. The [[Lehigh Valley Railroad]] maintained a beautiful station in downtown Pittston, near the foot of the Water Street Bridge. Sadly, the station did not survive the [[urban renewal]] of the 1960s; it was demolished in 1964. Pittston also had a station on the historic [[Lackawanna and Wyoming Valley Railroad]], commonly known as the [[Laurel Line]], an electric [[interurban]] [[streetcar]] line.

Besides mining [[anthracite coal]], Pittston was home to many industries in the 19th and 20th centuries, including [[metal]]s, [[plastic]]s, [[paper|paper products]], [[apparel]], [[electrical equipment]] and [[beverages]]. The Pittston Stove Company, established in 1864, manufactured coal and [[wood-burning stove]]s for heating and cooking. The Pittston Brewing Company, [[brewing|brewers]] of Glennon's Beer, maintained operations in Pittston from 1873 until 1948. Evan R. Jones Stoneware crafted pottery which bore the Pittston name in the 1870s and 1880s.

Main Street was the site of an active [[downtown]] into the 1970s, with many [[Department store|clothing stores]], shoe stores, jewelers, [[J. C. Penney|JC Penney]]s, [[Kresge's]], [[F. W. Woolworth Company|Woolworth's]], [[drug stores]], [[restaurant]]s, [[Movie theater|theaters]] and [[bank]]s.

Main Street was home to at least two theaters, the Roman at 27 South Main and the American at 48 North Main, both of which have been [[Demolition|razed]]. Many historic commercial structures were demolished in the [[urban renewal]] efforts of the 1960s.

===Contemporary era===
[[File:Pittston, Pennsylvania.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Storefronts in the downtown]]
On March 15, 1993, two Pittston [[firefighter]]s (John Lombardo and Len Insalaco) were killed while fighting a blaze on the city's [[main street]]. A monument was built in the downtown, and the nearby Water Street Bridge was renamed to commemorate their sacrifice during that tragic March day.

For decades, the towering spires of the many [[Protestant]] and [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] churches dominated the city's skyline. Most of the numerous Catholic churches were established to serve one of the many ethnic communities that made up Pittston. The [[Irish people|Irish]] had [[St. John the Evangelist]], the [[Slovaks]] had [[Saint John the Baptist Elementary School, Pittston|St. John the Baptist]], the [[Lithuanians]] had [[St. Casimir]]'s, the [[Germans]] had [[St. Mary]]'s Assumption, and the [[Italians]] had St. Rocco's and Our Lady of Mount Carmel. There is also a Byzantine Catholic Church on Main Street (St. Michael's). From 2004 to the present, the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Scranton|Diocese of Scranton]] has closed many of the churches and private schools in and around Pittston due to declining population and enrollment. [[Saint John the Baptist Elementary School, Pittston|Saint John the Baptist Elementary School]] closed in 2004, and [[Holy Redeemer High School#Before Holy Redeemer|Seton Catholic High School]] closed in 2007. St. Mary's Assumption School closed in 2011.

In recent years, the downtown area was [[renovation|renovated]] with new sidewalks, trees, and street lights. Older buildings are being demolished and newer structures (i.e., [[condominium]]s, restaurants, bars, and stores) are being built.

In early September 2011, [[Tropical Storm Lee (2011)|Tropical Storm Lee]] flooded parts of Pittston closest to the river. Cooper’s Seafood, [[Burger King]], and several other buildings along the riverfront were inundated.

==Downtown renovation==
In October 2005, it was revealed that Daniel Siniawa and Associates of [[Dickson City, Pennsylvania]], designed a condo complex for Pittston City. The location of this complex is at Kennedy Blvd. (between the Water Street Bridge and East Street). Riverfront Park is located to the west of the development. Each tower, 5 stories in height, will have 45 units. Space is currently being made by destroying CareerLink and other buildings. The Del-Mar Dress Factory and B&amp;G Beverage are also in the process of being purchased and demolished. For more information, visit: http://www.danielsiniawa.com/pittston_waterfront.htm

In 2008, the city invested in [[renovating]] the downtown area [[sidewalks]] with a [[brick]] theme. Colorful brick pavers line the sidewalks along the curbside and at street crossings. Black [[street lights]] and [[Signage|sign posts]] were also placed to enhance the appearance of the downtown.

In December 2009, several buildings along William Street were demolished.  These included [[Saint John the Baptist Elementary School, Pittston|St. John the Baptist Church and School, St. John the Baptist Catholic Information Library, St. John the Baptist Rectory, the Msgr. Joseph A. Super Athletic Center]], and Dave's Billiards. The only building remaining is part of the school where DeMuro's [[Pizzeria]] is located. A memorial green space is planned for the site of the church, because it had served the [[Slovaks|Slovak]] community for over 107 years. A parking lot is planned for the space where Dave's Billiards was located.

Kohl recalled in 1967 that the peanuts were eaten mostly by young men and boys who would walk Hamilton Street on Saturday nights flirting with girls and 'throwing the shells about with complete abandon.'

'''Allentown''' ([[Pennsylvania German language|Pennsylvania Dutch]]: ''Allenschteddel'') is a [[city]] located in [[Lehigh County, Pennsylvania|Lehigh County]], [[Pennsylvania]], in the [[United States]]. It is Pennsylvania's third most populous city, after [[Philadelphia]] and [[Pittsburgh]], and the [[List of United States cities by population|222nd largest city in the United States]]. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the city had a total population of 118,032 and is currently the fastest growing city in Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Census Bureau Delivers Pennsylvania's 2010 Census Population Totals|url=http://2010.census.gov/news/releases/operations/cb11-cn74.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the largest city in the metropolitan area known as the [[Lehigh Valley]], which had a population of 821,623 residents as of the 2010 U.S. Census&lt;ref name=&quot;census.gov&quot;&gt;[http://www.census.gov/popest/metro/files/2009/CBSA-EST2009-alldata.csv ]{{dead link|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and which in turn constitutes a portion of the [[New York City Metropolitan Area]].

==Overview==
Located on the [[Lehigh River]], Allentown is the largest of three adjacent cities that make up a region of eastern Pennsylvania and western [[New Jersey]] known as the [[Lehigh Valley]]. Allentown is {{convert|50|mi|km}} north of Philadelphia, the [[List of United States cities by population|fifth most populous]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Phoenix drops to 6th largest city | url = http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/2011/03/13/20110313phoenix-6th-largest-city-philadelphia.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; city in the United States, {{convert|80|mi|km}} east of [[Harrisburg]], the state capital, and {{convert|90|mi|km}} west of [[New York City]], the nation's largest city.

Two four-year colleges, [[Cedar Crest College]] and [[Muhlenberg College]], are located in Allentown. [[Dorney Park &amp; Wildwater Kingdom]], a very popular amusement park, is located just outside of the city.

[[Commercial airline]] service to and from the city is available through [[Lehigh Valley International Airport]] (LVIA). [[General aviation]] and charter service is offered by LVIA and [[Allentown Queen City Municipal Airport]].

The city is connected to the [[Interstate Highway System]] by [[Interstate 78]] and [[Interstate 476]], the Northeast Extension of the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]], which provide access connections to other major Northeastern United States urban areas. Also [[U.S. Route 22]], the Lehigh Valley Thruway, provides a limited access east-west highway connection to the Interstate Highway System to the northern parts of the city. Commuter train service between Allentown and Philadelphia ended in 1979 when state funding to operate the service ceased.

Allentown is a two-time winner of the [[All-America City Award]], being recognized in 1962 and 1974–1975.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncl.org/aac/past_winners/past_winners_1970s.html National Civic League Past Winners of the All-America City Award 1970s]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncl.org/aac/past_winners/past_winners_1960s.html National Civic League Past Winners of the All-America City Award 1960s]&lt;/ref&gt; Allentown was named the 12th most [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] city in America by the non-partisan Bay Area Center.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aug 16, 2005 12:00 AM&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Aug 16, 2005 12:00 AM |url=http://govpro.com/content/gov_imp_31439/ |title=Study Ranks America's Most Liberal and Conservative Cities |publisher=Govpro.com |date=August 16, 2005 |accessdate=December 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Founding===
The area that is today the center of Allentown was laid out as Northampton Town in 1762 by [[William Allen (loyalist)|William Allen]], a wealthy shipping merchant, former [[List of mayors of Philadelphia|mayor of the city of Philadelphia]] and then-Chief Justice of the [[Province of Pennsylvania]]. The property was part of a {{convert|5000|acre|km2|sing=on}} plot Allen purchased on September 10, 1735 from his business partner [[Joseph Turner (loyalist)|Joseph Turner]], who was assigned the warrant to the land by [[Thomas Penn]], son of [[William Penn]], on May 18, 1732.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allentown1916&quot;&gt;{{cite book |editor-last= Gordon |editor-first= L.C. |title= Allentown 1916 |year= 1916 | location = Allentown, Pennsylvania}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tract was originally surveyed on November 23, 1736.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allentown1916&quot;/&gt; A subsequent survey done in 1753 by David Schultz for a road from [[Easton, Pennsylvania|Easton]] to [[Reading, Pennsylvania|Reading]], of which present-day Union and Jackson streets were links, shows the location of a log house owned by Allen, situated near the western bank of the [[Jordan Creek (Pennsylvania)|Jordan Creek]], which was believed to have been built around 1740. Used primarily as a hunting and fishing lodge, here Allen entertained prominent guests including his brother-in-law, [[James Hamilton (Pennsylvania)|James Hamilton]], and colonial governor [[John Penn (governor)|John Penn]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Allentown1916&quot;&gt;Page 17. Source indicates that the foundations of the lodge were located and destroyed in 1845 when excavations took place for Jordan Street.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:ALLENTOWN PA TROUTHALL.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Trout Hall, built in 1770 by James Allen (son of Allentown founder [[William Allen (loyalist)|William Allen]]), is the oldest house in Allentown. From 1867 to 1905, it served as the home of [[Muhlenberg College]].]]

[[File:Dorney-park-night-1950.jpg|thumb|200px|Main entrance to [[Dorney Park &amp; Wildwater Kingdom]], 1950.]]
The original plan for the town, now in the archives of the [[Historical Society of Pennsylvania]], comprised forty-two city blocks and consisted of 756 lots, mostly {{convert|60|ft|m}} in width and {{convert|230|ft|m}} in depth. The town was located between present-day Fourth and Tenth Streets, and Union and Liberty Streets. Many streets on the original plan were named for Allen's children: Margaret (present-day Fifth Street), William (now Sixth), James (now Eighth), Ann (now Ninth) and John (now Walnut). Allen Street (now Seventh) was named for Allen himself, and was the main thoroughfare. Hamilton Street was named for [[James Hamilton (Pennsylvania)|James Hamilton]]. Gordon Street was named for Sir Patrick Gordon, [[Deputy Governor]] of [[Colonial Pennsylvania]] from 1726–1736. Chew Street was named for [[Benjamin Chew]], and Turner Street was named for Allen's business partner, [[Joseph Turner (loyalist)|Joseph Turner]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Allentown1916&quot;/&gt;

Allen hoped that Northampton Town would displace Easton as the seat of [[Northampton County, Pennsylvania|Northampton County]] and also become a commercial center due to its location along the Lehigh River and its proximity to Philadelphia. Allen gave the property to his son James in 1767. Three years later, in 1770, James built a summer residence, Trout Hall, in the new town, near the site of his father's former hunting lodge.&lt;ref name = &quot;Proceedings&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Roberts | first = Charles R. | title = William Allen, the Founder of Allentown, and His Descendants | journal = Proceedings of the Lehigh County Historical Society | issue = 1st | pages = 22–43 | publisher = Lehigh County Historical Society | location = Allentown, Pennsylvania | format = PDF | url = http://books.google.com/?id=j7VL8u8BCkUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=proceedings+lehigh-county-historical| year = 1908 | accessdate = August 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 18, 1811, the town was formally incorporated as the [[Borough]] of Northamptown. On March 6, 1812, Lehigh County was formed from the western half of Northampton County, and Northampton Town was selected as the county seat. The town was officially renamed &quot;Allentown&quot; on April 16, 1838, after years of popular usage. Allentown was formally incorporated as a city on March 12, 1867.&lt;ref name=&quot;dates&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.phmc.state.pa.us/bah/dam/counties/pdfs/Lehigh.pdf |format=PDF|title = Lehigh County – 4th class | accessdate = June 3, 2007 | publisher = [[Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission]]| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070629050922/http://www.phmc.state.pa.us/bah/dam/counties/pdfs/Lehigh.pdf| archivedate= June 29, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liberty Bell and the American Revolutionary War===
{{Main|Liberty Bell}}
{{See also|Liberty Bell Museum}}
Allentown holds historical significance as the location where the [[Liberty Bell]] (then known as the Pennsylvania State House bell) was successfully hidden from the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. After [[George Washington]]'s defeat at the [[Battle of Brandywine]] on September 11, 1777, the revolutionary capital of Philadelphia was defenseless, and that city prepared for British attack. The [[Supreme Executive Council of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania]] ordered that eleven bells, including the State House bell and the bells from Philadelphia's [[Christ Church, Philadelphia|Christ Church]] and [[St. Peter's Church, Philadelphia|St. Peter's Church]], be taken down and removed from the city to prevent the British, who would melt the bells down to cast into [[cannon]]s, from taking possession of them. The bells were transported north to Northampton-Towne, and hidden in the [[basement]] of the Old Zion Reformed Church, in what is now center city Allentown. Today, a shrine and museum in the church's basement, known as the [[Liberty Bell Museum]], marks the spot where the bell was hidden.

After the [[Battle of Trenton]] on December 26, 1776, [[Hessian (soldiers)|Hessian]] prisoners-of-war were kept in the vicinity of present-day Seventh and Gordon Streets. The Old Zion Reformed Church, and a house near James (now Eighth) and Hamilton Streets, served as hospitals for injured and sick [[Continental Army]] troops. In 1777, a factory manufacturing [[paper cartridge]]s for [[musket]]s was relocated here from nearby Bethlehem. That same year, a shop of sixteen [[Armourer|armorers]] was established along the [[Little Lehigh Creek]], and employed in the repair of weapons and the manufacture of [[saddle]]s and [[scabbard]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allentown1916&quot;/&gt;

===American Industrial Revolution===
{{further2|[[Industrial Revolution]] and [[Second Industrial Revolution]]}}
Prior to the 1830s, Allentown was a small town with only local markets. The arrival of the [[Lehigh Canal]], however, expanded the city's commercial and industrial capacity greatly. With this, the town underwent significant [[industrialization]], ultimately becoming a major center for heavy industry and manufacturing. While Allentown was not as large as neighboring [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania|Bethlehem]] at the time, the local iron industry — which included the Allentown Iron Company (established 1846) and the Allentown Rolling Mills (established 1860) — employed the majority of Allentown's workforce.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allentown1916&quot;/&gt; Railroads, such as the [[Lehigh Valley Railroad]], were vital to the movement of raw materials and finished goods, and employed a significant workforce during this time. This period of rapid economic growth in the region was halted by two events, the [[Panic of 1873]] and the [[Long Depression]].

In addition to the iron and railroad industries, Allentown also had a strong tradition in the [[brewing]] of [[beer]] and was home to several notable [[List of Pennsylvania breweries|breweries]], including the Horlacher Brewery (founded 1897, closed 1978),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.falstaffbrewing.com/horlacher.htm|title=Horlacher Brewing Company |accessdate=June 1, 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070607155057/http://www.falstaffbrewing.com/horlacher.htm| archivedate= June 7, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Neuweiler Brewery]] (founded 1875, closed 1968)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pabreweryhistorians.tripod.com/neuweiler.html |title=Neuweiler Brewery |accessdate=June 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Schaefer Beer]], whose brewery was later owned by [[Pabst Brewing Company]] and [[Guinness]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.siteselection.com/ssinsider/pwatch/pw011203.htm |title=$44 Million Guinness Investment Will Create 250 Jobs at Pennsylvania Brewery|accessdate=June 1, 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070629111341/http://www.siteselection.com/ssinsider/pwatch/pw011203.htm| archivedate= June 29, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is now owned by the Boston Beer Company, maker of [[Samuel Adams]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.pennlive.com/lvbreakingnews/2007/08/sam_adams_purchases_upper_macu.html |title=Sam Adams purchases Upper Macungie Twp. plant for $55 M |accessdate=January 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early 20th century to present===
Economic recovery in the early 20th century was brought about by the [[silk]] and [[textile industry]]. The Adelaide Silk Mill, one of the largest in the world at the time, opened in Allentown in 1881. By 1928, there were more than 140 silk and textile mills in the Lehigh Valley, making it the second largest industry in the region. By the 1930s, the silk industry was in worldwide decline, as [[Synthetic fiber|synthetics]] were taking the place of silk. Catoir Silk Mill, the last silk mill in Allentown, closed in 1989. In 1905, [[Mack Trucks]] moved to Allentown, beginning Allentown's focus on heavy industrial manufacturing. Today, Allentown's economy, like most of Pennsylvania's, is based in the [[Tertiary sector of industry|service industries]] with some manufacturing. [[Deindustrialization]] has caused many of the factories and corporations headquartered in Allentown to close or move. For example, [[Mack Trucks]] is now located in [[Greensboro, North Carolina]], [[LSI Corporation]] (formerly [[Western Electric]], later Agere Systems, which merged with LSI Logic) moved its headquarters to [[California]], and numerous factories have ceased operation. On the other hand, the Allentown Economic Development (AEDC) operates a business incubator, the Bridgeworks, which helps attract and support young commercial and manufacturing businesses.

{{Further|Dime Savings and Trust Company|PPL Center}}
[[File:One City Center - planned Illustration.jpg|thumb|200px|Planned One City Center at 7th and Hamilton Streets.]]
Plans for a major redevelopment of the Central Business District of Allentown were announced in late 2009 as a result of Neighborhood Improvement Zone (NIZ) legislation passed by the Pennsylvania legislature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/neighborhood_improvement_zone/20491 Neighborhood Improvement Zone (NIZ)]&lt;/ref&gt;  Focused on the 7th and Hamilton Streets area, a {{convert|5|acre|m2|adj=on}} one square block was acquired in 2011 in which several new structures are planned to be erected:&lt;ref name=&quot;cost&quot;&gt;[http://articles.mcall.com/2012-09-25/news/mc-allentown-pa-arena-block-20120924_1_city-center-investment-arena-block-sara-hailstone Allentown's arena block to cost $272 million]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''An 8,500-seat arena''', including sports bar and retail shop.  Estimated cost: $177.1 Million Dollars.&lt;ref name=&quot;cost&quot;/&gt;

* '''An eight-story office building''' for [[Lehigh Valley Hospital]]'s sports medicine center, which will occupy floors two through six. The first floor will be retail space and a sports bar, with floors seven and eight open for a yet-to-be-signed lease.  The building will be a finished shell that will require what could be tens of millions of dollars more to customize it. Estimated cost: $24.5 Million Dollars.&lt;ref name=&quot;cost&quot;/&gt;

* '''A 180-room hotel, restaurant and banquet center'''. The building will need millions of dollars more in finishing touches by a yet-to-be-determined national chain. Estimated cost:$23.5 Million Dollars.&lt;ref name=&quot;cost&quot;/&gt;

* '''Two parking decks''' to be owned by the city. One five-story parking deck with 640 spaces is to be built on Linden Street, behind the hotel. A second parking lot, this one 120-spaces, is to be built under the office building on Hamilton Street.  Estimated cost: $19 Million Dollars.&lt;ref name=&quot;cost&quot;/&gt;

* Two additional structures, '''One City Center''' and '''Two City Center''' are planned.  One City Center is a $50 million office complex that would include a 570-space underground parking garage with an estimated capacity of  more than 700 mostly white-collar office workers.    One City Center is proposed for the southeast corner of 7th and Hamilton Streets on Center Square.  Two City Center will be located on the northeast corner of 7th and Hamilton Streets.  Demolition of the former First National Bank began for Two City Center in October 2012.  Two City Center is under contstuction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.mcall.com/2011-12-14/news/mc-allentown-arena-reilly-20111214_1_allentown-hockey-arena-neighborhood-improvement-zone-downtown-allentown-development Developer unveils $50 million office complex]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lehighvalleylive.com/allentown/index.ssf/2012/10/plans_for_allentown_hockey_are.html Plans for Allentown hockey arena office buildings merge into one, larger building]&lt;/ref&gt;

Allentown has a history in the sport of professional [[baseball]] that dates back to 1884. In 2008, Allentown unveiled [[Coca-Cola Park (Allentown)|Coca-Cola Park]], a $50.25 million, 8,100-seat stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url = http://www.mcall.com/news/local/all-b1_5stadium-r.6642216oct25,0,6880166.story | last = Isherwood | first = Darryl R. | title = Stadium's final cost hits $50.25 million | newspaper = [[The Morning Call]] | location = Allentown, Pennsylvania | date = October 25, 2008 | accessdate = October 25, 2008 |postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium was constructed in east-side Allentown to serve as the home field for the [[Philadelphia Phillies]]' AAA-level [[Minor League Baseball|Minor League baseball]] team, the [[Lehigh Valley IronPigs]]. The IronPigs, a member of the [[International League]], are the first [[Major League Baseball|Major League]]-affiliated club to play in the city since 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mcall.com/sports/all-ironpigs-special-033008-heffner,0,4139387.story |title=&quot;Minor league park was a major hit,&quot; ''Morning Call'', March 30, 2008 |accessdate=May 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Basketball===
Allentown hosted the [[Allentown Jets]], an [[Continental Basketball Association|Eastern Professional Basketball League]] team, from 1958 to 1981. The Jets were one of the most dominant franchises in the league's history, winning eight playoff championships and twelve division titles.

===Gymnastics===
[[Parkettes National Gymnastics Training Center]], which has been the training ground for numerous Olympians and U.S. national gymnastics champions, is based in Allentown. In 2003, [[CNN]] aired a documentary on Parkettes, ''[[Achieving the Perfect 10]]'', which depicted it as a hugely demanding and competitive training program.

===Ice hockey===
In March 2011, plans were announced for the creation of [[PPL Center]], an 8,500-seat arena to be built in Allentown, which is planned to be the future home for the [[Adirondack Phantoms]], the [[American Hockey League]] affiliate of the [[Philadelphia Flyers]].  The arena will be located in downtown Allentown, taking up the entire block between 7th and 8th Streets and Hamilton and Linden Streets.  In a controversial decision, the city has invoked [[eminent domain]] to help obtain the necessary properties and a contractor is expected to be chosen in 2012.  In January 2012, buildings on the current site began to be demolished to make room for the new arena.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lehighvalleylive.com/allentown/index.ssf/2011/05/post_63.html Allentown council authorizes use of eminent domain for hockey arena if needed]. lehighvalleylive.com.

In summer 2012, however, the lawsuits were dropped and the project was resumed. The arena is expected to be completed in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcall.com/news/breaking/mc-allentown-arena-pa-hanover-votes-20120522,0,4264460.story Hanover rejects Allentown's arena settlement offer]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcall.com/news/breaking/mc-allentown-arena-pa-bethlehem-township-votes-20120521,0,3511132.story Bethlehem Township officials reject arena deal]&lt;/ref&gt; The team's name will be the '''Lehigh Valley Phantoms'''.

The Center City area along [[Pennsylvania Route 222|Hamilton Street]] between 5th and 10th Streets was the primary shopping district in Allentown until the mid-1970s. The &quot;Downtown&quot;, as it was referred to, was anchored by [[Hess's]] (9th and Hamilton); [[H. Leh and Company]] (7th and Hamilton), and [[Zollinger and Harned]] (6th and Hamilton) department stores. Along Hamilton street were scores of retail businesses; large banks; movie theaters and various small restaurants and lunch counters. On the second and third stories, professional offices could be found in many of the smaller buildings with storefronts on the first floor. Alfred L. Reichenbach, Mayor of Allentown in the late 1910s, traveled to Europe and saw beautiful hanging gardens and floral lamp posts in Paris and in some cities in Germany. He was also an amateur horticulturist and enjoyed all varieties of flowers and anyone visiting the mayor's office during his tenure would find vases of flowers for all seasons on his desk and tables. In fact, it was he who had floral boxes planted outside the mayor's window so he, and his fellow citizens, could enjoy seasonal floral designs. He believed that it would be a good way to beautify the downtown shopping district and encouraged the City Council with idea of purchasing the floral lamp posts during the renovations of Hamilton Street in 1916.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.mcall.com/1991-08-20/news/2812374_1_floral-lamp-posts Father Of The Floral Lamp Posts, The Morning Call, August 20, 1991]&lt;/ref&gt;

Businesses generally operated from 9am to 5pm Monday-Saturday, staying open until 9pm on Thursdays and starting in the mid-1960s, also on Monday nights. Until 1952, Lehigh Valley Transit street trolleys operated east-west along the length of Hamilton Street, and also north and south along 8th Street. The major transit station downtown being at 8th &amp; Hamilton.

In the 1950s, a privately owned parking lot system (Park &amp; Shop) to accommodate shoppers and downtown workers began to be built by razing old buildings generally within a block of Hamilton between Walnut and Linden streets, with Hamilton Street merchants providing validation for shoppers parking tickets. In the early 1970s, Hess's and Leh's built large, private multilevel covered parking decks connected to their department stores to attract customers.

In 1966, the [[Whitehall Mall]] opened along [[Pennsylvania Route 145|MacArthur Road]], just north of Allentown in [[Whitehall Township, Pennsylvania|Whitehall Township]]. It was the first enclosed shopping center north of Philadelphia when it opened.&lt;ref name=&quot;whitehallmall&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |last=Blumenau | first=Kurt| title=The different sides of Whitehall Mall ** MacArthur Road's first retail center has changed over time. More is to come.| newspaper=[[The Morning Call]] | pages=AA.1 | date=April 25, 2004 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having two major department stores ([[Sears|Sears &amp; Roebuck]] and Zollinger and Harned) as anchor stores when it opened, its popularity led to the rise of a sprawling retail district along MacArthur Road that continued to expand into the early 1990s. After a major renovation in 1998, the Whitehall Mall's anchors included [[Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond]], [[Kohl's]], and [[Sears]].&lt;ref name=&quot;whitehallmall&quot;/&gt;

In the early 1970s, Hess's South, a satellite location of the Hess's downtown store, expanded to become the [[South Mall]], located in South Allentown, at the city's border with [[Salisbury Township, Lehigh County, Pennsylvania|Salisbury Township]] and [[Emmaus, Pennsylvania|Emmaus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;southmall&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |last=Blumenau | first=Kurt| title=Valley of the malls ** The region is in the midst of biggest burst of building since 1970s.| newspaper=[[The Morning Call]] | pages=A.1 | date=April 8, 2007 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the South Mall's anchors include [[Gold's Gym]], [[Petco]], [[Staples Inc.|Staples]], [[Stein Mart]], and [[The Bon-Ton]].

In 1976, the [[Lehigh Valley Mall]] opened, just south of the Whitehall Mall, at the intersection of [[U.S. Route 22]] and MacArthur Road. With more than 140 stores, the Lehigh Valley Mall became the largest shopping mall in the region, and presently has anchors including [[Boscov's]], [[JCPenney]] and [[Macy's]]. A large outdoor shopping addition opened in October 2007, and includes stores such as [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] and [[Barnes &amp; Noble]]. Most recently, [[The Promenade Shops at Saucon Valley]], a large, upscale outdoor shopping mall, opened just south of the city, near [[Pennsylvania Route 309]] and [[Interstate 78]], in [[Upper Saucon Township, Pennsylvania|Upper Saucon Township]].

[[File:Hmall-6th-looking-west-summer-1974.jpg|thumb|200px|View westwards of Hamilton Mall from 6th Street, taken during the summer of 1974, shortly after its completion. The mall included overhead sidewalk and street crossing canopies at half-streets, wide sidewalks with accent lighting, freshly planted trees that lined [[Pennsylvania Route 222|Hamilton Boulevard]] from 6th to 10th Streets, and a limited, two-space drop-off, pick-up only parking area. Today, the wide brick sidewalk and trees are the mall's only remnants.]]
By the late 1960s, the development of suburban strip shopping centers (Lehigh, Crest Plaza, Two Guys, Mountainville, and Parkway) in the area during the late 1950s and 1960s and especially the opening of the indoor [[Whitehall Mall]] in 1966 were steadily reducing the number of shoppers along Hamilton Street. Consumers preferred the convenience of easy access via automobile, and the enclosed Whitehall Mall to the pedestrian outdoor sidewalk shopping which was found along Hamilton Street. The City of Allentown hired the firm of David M. Walker Associates in 1969 to explore the needs of Center City. The 1969 Walker Report concluded that automobile traffic had taken over the downtown shopping area and that a traffic-free business district between Linden, Walnut, Sixth and Tenth Streets be developed and to convert the downtown Hamilton Street shopping area to a &quot;Semimall&quot;, later known as &quot;Hamilton Mall&quot;. Traffic would no longer be allowed on Hamilton Street. The intersection of Eighth and Hamilton would be closed as well as all half streets intersecting Hamilton. This would create a large pedestrian shopping &quot;superblock&quot; between Center Square and 9th Street, with two smaller shopping blocks between Sixth and Seventh and Ninth and Tenth. Center Square would become a large, pedestrian only area with Seventh street being reduced to one lane on each side of the Soldier's and Sailor's Monument. Hamilton Street would be completely rebuilt, with the existing street removed and replaced by a raised brick walking surface. Large, enclosing canopies would be built on each side of the street to provide shoppers protection from the weather, and small buses would operate east-west between 6th and 10th Streets picking up and dropping off shoppers to give them easy access to retail stores.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hmall&quot;&gt;Allentown, 1762–1987, a 225 Year history, Volume II, 1921–1987, Lehigh County Historical Society, 1987. Chapter Thirteen, A History of Allentown: 1966–1975&lt;/ref&gt;

During a 30-day test in April 1971, traffic on Hamilton Street was shut down between Sixth and Tenth and [[Lehigh and Northampton Transportation Authority|Lehigh Valley Transit]] provided small buses, free of charge for shoppers. Walnut Street, which traditionally ran one way east to west, was reversed to run west-east, with traffic along Hamilton Street being diverted south to Walnut at Twelfth street for eastbound travel. Traffic moving westbound on Hamilton Street was diverted north at Sixth, then moved west along Linden to Twelfth, then south to Hamilton, giving the center city a circular traffic flow around the pedestrian-only Center City.

Problems quickly arose. It was difficult for small merchants downtown to receive deliveries, since the half streets were blocked and the narrow streets did not allow turnarounds of small delivery trucks. Also, the new restriction prohibiting automobile traffic on Hamilton Street was unpopular, and the proposed closing of the Eighth and Hamilton intersection was deemed impractical, since it blocked a major north-south route from South Allentown. Within a week, Eighth Street was reopened. The plan was also changed to allow limited two-lane automobile traffic on Hamilton Street one-way west to east, with limited drop-off and pick-up only parking. Traffic lights were installed at each major street and half street with a speed limit of {{convert|20|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. The sidewalks would be expanded outwards with canopies covering them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hmall&quot;/&gt;

Final plans were developed and approval was given by City Council in October 1971. Construction of Hamilton Mall began in early 1972, with construction lasting until 1974. Starting at 10th street and proceeding east, one full block at a time was closed to traffic with the existing street surface and sidewalks removed (including the old trolley tracks which had been asphalted over in the 1950s) along with the sidewalks on each side of the street. In addition, the famous downtown sidewalk street lights, which contained hanging flower gardens, were scrapped. Retail store street signs were also removed, including the large signature Hess's department store sign because they interfered with the sidewalk street canopies. The large parking areas at Center Square and comfort station under the square were also removed and turned into large brick sidewalks, along with the resurfacing of Seventh Street between Linden and Walnut Streets.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hmall&quot;/&gt;

The construction of Hamilton Mall caused severe disruption in the downtown shopping area for more than two years. During that time, merchants and Center City employees experienced enormous difficulties as sections of Hamilton Street were closed for months at a time. The sidewalks along Hamilton Street were reduced to single path walkways, and piles of rubble, construction material, the sounds of heavy construction equipment took over the downtown area. During the construction period shoppers tended to avoid the downtown area and shop in the suburban malls and shopping centers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hmall&quot;/&gt;

Officially opened in 1974, Hamilton Mall never lived up to the expectations of the city planners. Large numbers of shoppers did not return to the downtown area. The opening of [[Lehigh Valley Mall]] in 1976 and other, smaller malls in the suburbs with outside satellite stores increased the number of businesses closing along Hamilton Street. The major expansion of [[Pennsylvania Route 145|MacArthur Road]] in [[Whitehall Township, Pennsylvania|Whitehall Township]] also led to fewer and fewer shoppers on Hamilton Mall. Improvements were made along Hamilton Mall by removing the overhead sidewalk canopies and installing a new generation of street lights, designed to replicate the hanging flower gardens of the ones removed in the construction were erected to improve the Mall's appearance. Parking meters were installed to allow longer term, but still limited parking. However, by the late 1970s, increased [[suburbanization]] led to a general decline in the popularity of the downtown shopping district. Retail shopping downtown declined with the closing of Leh's (1987) and Zollinger's (1978) downtown and culminated with the last major department store, Hess's, being sold-off in 1994, eventually being closed and subsequently demolished in 2000. Instead of a shopping Mecca, the use of downtown Allentown has turned into office buildings and increasingly has become a center-city campus for city and county government workers, along with those of [[PPL (utility)|PPL]].

{{Main|Allentown School District}}
The City of Allentown is served by the [[Allentown School District]], which is the fourth largest [[school district]] in Pennsylvania, with 18,118 students (based on 2005–2006 enrollment data).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://nces.ed.gov/ccd/districtsearch/district_list.asp?Search=1&amp;details=1&amp;InstName=&amp;DistrictID=&amp;Address=&amp;City=&amp;State=42&amp;Zip=&amp;Miles=&amp;County=&amp;PhoneAreaCode=&amp;Phone=&amp;DistrictType=1&amp;DistrictType=2&amp;DistrictType=3&amp;DistrictType=4&amp;DistrictType=5&amp;DistrictType=6&amp;DistrictType=7&amp;NumOfStudents=15000&amp;NumOfStudentsRange=more&amp;NumOfSchools=&amp;NumOfSchoolsRange=more | title = Public School Districts | publisher = National Center for Education Statistics, U.S. Department of Education (2005–06 School Year) | accessdate = November 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city maintains two public high schools for grades 9–12, [[William Allen High School]], which serves students from the southern and western parts of the city, and [[Louis E. Dieruff High School]], which serves students from the eastern and northern parts. Each of these Allentown area high schools competes athletically in the [[Lehigh Valley Conference]]. Both schools play their home [[American football|football]] games at [[J. Birney Crum Stadium]].

Allentown School District's four middle schools, for grades 6–8, include: Francis D. Raub Middle School, Harrison-Morton Middle School, South Mountain Middle School and Trexler Middle School.

The [[Roberto Clemente Charter School]], also located in the Allentown School District, is a [[Title I]] [[charter school]] which provides educational services to mainly [[Hispanic]] students in grades 6 through 12.

The Allentown School District is currently undertaking a 10 year, $120 million facilities improvement plan. The plan includes renovation of all 23 schools in the district. Most of the schools to be renovated will be expanded. Two additional elementary schools and a fifth middle school are expected to be built.&lt;ref name=&quot;asdfacilities&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |last1=Haymon| first1=Elizabeth| last2=Weiss |first2 = Andrew|title=ASD building program is about growth, quality.| newspaper=[[The Morning Call]] | pages=A.7 | date=January 16, 2007 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The region is also served by [[Allentown Queen City Municipal Airport]] {{Airport codes||KXLL|XLL}}, a two-runway general aviation facility located in South Allentown used predominantly by private aviation.

====Roads====
{{See also|Allentown Parking Authority}}
Four expressways run through the Allentown area, with associated exits to the city: [[Interstate 78]], which runs from [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]] in the west to [[New York City]]'s [[Holland Tunnel]] in the east; the Northeast Extension of the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]], (which is part of [[I-476]]), runs from [[Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania|Plymouth Meeting]] outside Philadelphia in the south to [[Interstate 81 in Pennsylvania|Interstate 81]] at [[Clarks Summit, Pennsylvania|Clarks Summit]] in the north; [[Pennsylvania Route 309]], which runs from Philadelphia in the south to [[The Poconos]] in the north; and [[U.S. Route 22]], which runs from [[Cincinnati, Ohio]] in the west to [[Newark, New Jersey]] in the east.

===Telecommunications===
[[File:Lehigh-Valley-Hospital.x.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Lehigh Valley Hospital]] in Allentown, 2008]]
Allentown and the Lehigh Valley area were once served only by the [[Area codes 215 and 267|215]] [[area code]] from 1947 (when the [[North American Numbering Plan]] of the [[Bell System]] went into effect) until 1994. With the city and region's growing population, however, Allentown and its surrounding areas were afforded [[Area codes 610 and 484|area code 610]] in 1994. Today, the city of Allentown is covered by 610. An [[area code overlay|overlay area code]], 484, was added to the 610 service area in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{PDFlink|[http://www.nanpa.com/pdf/pl-nanp-135.pdf NANP-Overlay of 610 (Pennsylvania) Numbering Plan Area (NPA) with 484 NPA]|359&amp;nbsp;KB}}&lt;/ref&gt; A plan to introduce area code 835 as an additional overlay was rescinded in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{PDFlink|[http://www.nanpa.com/pdf/PL_344.pdf PA 835 Implementation for 484/610 NPA Rescinded – 835 NPA Code Reclaimed]|20.8&amp;nbsp;KB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health systems===
Allentown is home to several hospitals and health networks, including [[St. Luke's Health Network]], Sacred Heart Hospital, the [[Lehigh Valley Hospital|Lehigh Valley Health Network]], and the Good Shepherd Rehabilitation Network.  Formerly, the city was home to the [[Allentown State Hospital]], a psychiatric hospital which closed in 2010.

===Utilities===
Electricity in Allentown is provided by [[PPL (utility)|PPL]], also known as PP&amp;L. [[UGI Corp.|UGI]] provides [[natural gas]] for homes. Two cable systems, [[RCN Corporation]] (originally Twin County Cable) and [[Service Electric|Service Electric Cable TV, Inc.]], have served the city since the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Moss | first = Linda | title = In the Keystone State, Service Electric Thrives | publisher = Multichannel News | date = August 1, 2005 |url = http://www.multichannel.com/article/CA631093.html | accessdate = June 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area's only landfill, IESI Bethlehem, is located in nearby [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania]].

===City parks===
{{Main|List of city parks of Allentown, Pennsylvania}}
The City of Allentown has one of the best park systems in the country. Much of the city's park system can be attributed to the efforts of industrialist [[Harry Clay Trexler]]. Inspired by the [[City Beautiful movement]] in the early 20th century, Trexler helped create West Park, a {{convert|6.59|acre|m2|sing=on}} park in what was then a community trash pit and sandlot baseball field&lt;ref name=&quot;WestPark&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |last=Whelan | first=Frank| title=West Park the iconic home for Allentown bands. | newspaper=[[The Morning Call]] | pages=E.1 | date=May 29, 2005 | url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=847329201&amp;sid=4&amp;Fmt=3&amp;clientId=53705&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=PQD |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; in an upscale area of the city. The park, which opened in 1909, features a [[bandshell]], designed by noted [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] architect [[Horace Trumbauer]], which has long been home to the [[Allentown Band]] and other community bands.&lt;ref name=&quot;WestPark&quot;/&gt; Trexler also facilitated the development of Trexler Park, Cedar Parkway, Allentown Municipal Golf Course and the Trout Nursery in Lehigh Parkway. Trexler was also responsible for the development of the Trexler Trust, which to this day continues to provide private funding for the maintenance and development of Allentown's park system.&lt;ref name=&quot;Parks&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allentownpa.org/parks.htm |title=Allentown, PA – Parks |accessdate=June 2, 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070610013313/http://www.allentownpa.org/parks.htm| archivedate= June 10, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wilkes-Barre''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|w|ɪ|l|k|s|b|ær|i}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/barre |title=Barre – Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |accessdate=December 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a city in the [[U.S. state|State]] of [[Pennsylvania]], the [[county seat]] of [[Luzerne County, Pennsylvania|Luzerne County]]. It is at the center of the [[Wyoming Valley]] area with a population of 41,498, making it the 13th largest city in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. It is one of the principal cities in the [[Scranton/Wilkes-Barre]] [[metropolitan area]], which had a population of 563,631 as of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 Census]] making it the fourth largest metro/statistical area in the state of Pennsylvania. According to the city's Facebook page, Wilkes-Barre houses the 4th largest downtown workforce in the state of Pennsylvania. Wilkes-Barre was founded in 1769 and formally incorporated in 1806.

Wilkes-Barre and the surrounding Wyoming Valley are framed by the [[The Poconos|Pocono Mountains]] to the east, the [[Endless Mountains]] to the west and the [[Lehigh Valley]] to the south. The [[Susquehanna River]] flows through the center of the valley and defines the northwestern border of the city.

==History==
[[File:Wilkes-Barre 1889.jpg|thumb|325px|left|Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, as depicted on an 1889 panoramic map]]

===Beginnings===
The Wyoming Valley was first inhabited by the [[Shawanese]] and [[Lenape|Delaware Indian]] tribes in the early 18th century. By 1769, a group led by John Durkee became the first Europeans to reach the area. The settlement was named Wilkes-Barre after [[John Wilkes]] and [[Isaac Barré]], two British members of Parliament who supported [[colonial America]].

The initial settlers were aligned with [[Connecticut]], which had a claim on the land that rivaled Pennsylvania's. Armed men loyal to Pennsylvania twice attempted to evict the residents of Wilkes-Barre in what came to be known as the [[Pennamite Wars]]. After the [[American Revolution]], the conflict was resolved so that the settlers retained title to their lands but transferred their allegiance to Pennsylvania.{{clr}}

In 1797, several decades after the city's founding, [[Louis Philippe I|Louis Philippe]], later the King of France from 1830 to 1840, stayed in Wilkes-Barre while traveling to the French Asylum settlement.

===Industrial foundations: manufacturing, coal and railroads===
[[File:Vulcan Iron Works print advertisement from Railway Age Magazine, February 5, 1944 large pre1978 noC.jpg|thumb|upright|Wilkes-Barre Pennsylvania [[Vulcan Iron Works]] produced both steam and diesel locomotives in 1944]]
Wilkes-Barre's population exploded due to the discovery of [[anthracite coal]] in the 19th century, which gave the city the nickname of &quot;The Diamond City.&quot; Hundreds of thousands of immigrants flocked to the city, seeking jobs in the numerous mines and collieries that sprung up. The [[Vulcan Iron Works]] was a well-known manufacturer of railway locomotives from 1849 to 1954.

During Wilkes-Barre's reign as an industrial and economic force in America, a number of franchises decided to plant their roots in the city, such as Woolworth's, Sterling Hotels, Planter's Peanuts, Miner's Bank, Bell Telephone, HBO, Luzerne National Bank, and Stegmaier. In addition, the demolished Old Fell House on Northampton St is believed to be the first place in the entire world Anthracite was burned for heat.&lt;ref&gt;Pennsylvania Historical Society&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century===
[[File:South Main Street, from Public Square, Wilkes-Barre, PA.jpg|thumb|right|275px|South Main Street in 1906.]]
Wilkes-Barre is the birthplace of the [[Planters|Planters Peanuts Company]], which was founded in 1906 by Italian immigrant Amedeo Obici and partner Mario Peruzzi.

It is said that [[Babe Ruth]] hit one of the longest [[home run]]s in history in Wilkes-Barre early in the 20th century. This statement is quoted from the [[Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders]] News page: &quot;On October 12, 1926, Babe Ruth visited Wilkes-Barre's Artillery Park to play in an exhibition game between [[Hughestown, Pennsylvania|Hughestown]] and [[Larksville, Pennsylvania|Larksville]]. Suiting up for Hughestown, the Yankee slugger challenged Larksville's hurler [[Ernie Corkran]] to throw him his 'best stuff'—a fastball right down the heart of the plate. Corkran obliged and Ruth crushed the pitch into deep right field. When the ball cleared the fence, a good 400 feet away from home plate, it was still rising. It finally landed in Kirby Park on the far side of a high school running track. Ruth himself was so impressed by the feat that he asked for his homer to be measured. Originally estimated at 650 feet, the prodigious blast is considered to be the longest home run in baseball's storied history.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.milb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070702&amp;content_id=269068&amp;vkey=news_t531&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;sid=t531 |title=Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees |publisher=Minorleaguebaseball.com |date=October 12, 1926 |accessdate=June 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The coal industry survived several disasters, including an explosion at the Baltimore Colliery in 1919 that killed 92 miners, but it could not survive the gradual switch to other energy sources. Most coal operations left Wilkes-Barre by the end of World War II, and the 1959 [[Knox Mine Disaster]] marked the end of King Coal's heyday. The city went into a decades-long decline, hastened by [[Hurricane Agnes]] in 1972.

In November 1972, 365 subscribers of Service Electric Cable were the first to receive [[HBO]]'s service, making Wilkes-Barre the birthplace of modern cable TV programming.

===Disastrous flooding===
Manufacturing and retail remained Wilkes-Barre's strongest industries, but the city's economy took a major blow from [[Hurricane Agnes|Tropical Storm Agnes]] in 1972. The storm pushed the [[Susquehanna River]] to a height of nearly {{convert|41|ft}}, four feet above the city's levees, flooding downtown with nine feet of water. While no lives were lost, 25,000 homes and businesses were either damaged or destroyed; damages were estimated to be $1 billion, with President [[Richard Nixon]] sending aid to the area.

Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Wilkes-Barre attempted to repair the damage from Agnes by building a levee system that rises 41 feet; it has successfully battled less threatening floods of 1996, 2004, and 2006, and the [[Army Corps of Engineers]] has praised the quality of the levees. In 2006 the city made the front page of national newspapers when 200,000 residents were told to evacuate in the wake of flooding that was forecast to reach levels near that of 1972 but fell short of predictions.

In late August 2011, [[Hurricane Irene 2011|Hurricane Irene]] off the New Jersey coast caused the Susquehanna River to rise to flood stage but was no cause for alarm for the city. However, from September 6 to September 8, heavy rains from the inland remnants of [[Tropical Storm Lee (2011)|Tropical Storm Lee]] and [[Hurricane Katia (2011)|Hurricane Katia]] offshore funneled heavy rain over the Wyoming Valley and into the Susquehanna River watershed. The Susquehanna swelled to record levels across the state, and in Wilkes-Barre crested on September 9 at an all-time record of {{convert|42.66|ft}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://water.weather.gov/ahps2/hydrograph.php?wfo=bgm&amp;gage=wbrp1|title=Advanced Hydrologic Prediction Service for the Susquehanna River at Wilkes-Barre |publisher=NOAA National Weather Service |accessdate=September 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; nearly two feet higher than the previously disastrous water levels from 1972's Hurricane Agnes. Wilkes-Barre was spared from any major flooding by the levees built on the river banks of the city, however nearby boroughs that were unprotected by levees such as [[West Pittston, Pennsylvania|West Pittston]], [[Plymouth, Pennsylvania|Plymouth]], and parts of [[Plains Township, Luzerne County, Pennsylvania|Plains Township]] were affected by extreme flooding and the subsequent water damage.

On June 9, 2005, Mayor [[Thomas M. Leighton]] unveiled his ''I&amp;nbsp;believe...'' campaign for Wilkes-Barre, which was intended to boost the city's spirits. Construction began on a planned downtown theatre complex which had a grand opening on June 30, 2006, and renovation of the landmark [[Hotel Sterling]] was being pursued by CityVest, a nonprofit developer. The expansion of [[Wilkes University]] and [[King's College (Pennsylvania)|King's College]] has taken place. Also, the canopy and matching street lights in Public Square and across downtown were removed; the replacements are new green lampposts.

The City of Wilkes-Barre celebrated its 200th anniversary in 2006. There were several events which were scheduled to commemorate this occasion over the July 4 weekend, including a free concert with the [[Beach Boys]] in the city's [[Kirby Park]]. However, due to extremely heavy rains, the Susquehanna River crested high enough that most of the city had to be evacuated on June 28, 2006, forcing the cancellation of the events. Afterwards, the city rescheduled their  [[Wikt:bicentennial|Bicentennial]] Blastoff, their Bicentennial Parade and the Bicentennial Gala to different dates throughout August. The Beach Boys rescheduled their concert and played a Kirby Park concert on Labor Day weekend, Sunday September 3, 2006, attended by Pennsylvania Governor [[Ed Rendell]].

The Riverfront revitalization project (River Common), which broke ground in 2007 and was fully completed in early 2010, once again made the riverfront pleasant and accessible to the public. The riverfront now includes an amphitheater, handicapped-accessible ramps and sidewalks, fountains, as well as full lighting including color-changing LED accent systems underneath two bridges which carry pedestrian traffic across the normally-open levee breachings. These breachings can be promptly closed in the event of high water by way of an insert which is stored on rails inside the wall at each breaching. The project stretches approximately four blocks from the Luzerne County Courthouse to the intersection of S. River Street and W. South Street. The River Common has since played host to concerts and charity events such as Relay for Life and is used by residents on a daily basis as a nearby retreat from the city itself.

Since completion of the River Common, various improvements to city infrastructure have been progressing. New crosswalks have been installed downtown, which include signage reminding motorists that pedestrians have the right-of-way. The completion of the James F. Conahan Intermodal Transportation Facility has added parking and moved Luzerne County Transportation Authority buses from their former Public Square staging locations, reducing congestion in the square. Private carrier Martz offers coach bus service from the terminal as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;transportation-1&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://citizensvoice.com/news/w-b-intermodal-center-opens-today-1.878566#axzz1VC0wh5As|title=W-B intermodal center opens today|date=July 6, 2010|publisher=Citizens Voice|accessdate=August 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The widening and realignment of Coal Street, a major road connecting Wilkes-Barre city with Wilkes-Barre Township, was completed in 2012. The new Coal Street provides four lanes over the original two lanes, making travel between the highly commercial Wilkes-Barre Township and the city itself much easier. The 2012 realignment also provides a rather spectacular view of the city center when traveling west into Wilkes-Barre City.

Political corruption in Wilkes-Barre and Luzerne County became a major regional news story following nationwide publication of stories about the [[Kids for cash scandal|Kids for Cash scandal]], a kickback scheme involving two local judges, [[Mark Ciavarella]] and [[Michael Conahan]], charged with enriching themselves by investing in [[Youth detention center|juvenile detention facilities]] to which they subsequently sentenced children under their judicial power.&lt;ref name=&quot;factcheck1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Novak|first=Viveca|title=Court Watch: Pennsylvania Slime|url=http://www.factcheck.org/2009/10/court-watch-pennsylvania-slime/|publisher=FactCheck.org|accessdate=August 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judges were implicated by another county judge who was being investigated as part of an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] probe of events at the courthouse in Wilkes-Barre and corruption generally in the county.&lt;ref name=&quot;hall-summary&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.com/jsp/nlj/PubArticleNLJ.jsp?id=1202427800493&amp;slreturn=1&amp;hbxlogin=1|title=Judges to Serve More Than Seven Years in Prison After Pleading Guilty in Kickbacks Probe|author=Peter Hall and Leo Strupczewski|date=January 28, 2009|publisher=The Legal Intelligencer| accessdate=August 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following months over 30 persons were charged as a result of the corruption probe.&lt;ref name=&quot;corruptionprobe&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Corruption Probe|url=http://citizensvoice.com/news/corruption-probe|publisher=Wilkes-Barre Citizens Voice|accessdate=August 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;janoski-20100807&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Janoski|first=Dave|title=Judge: Charge those who offered bribes|url=http://citizensvoice.com/news/judge-charge-those-who-offered-bribes-1.929055|accessdate=August 14, 2010|newspaper=Wilkes-Barre Citizens Voice|date=August 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2010, former Luzerne County Commissioner [[Greg Skrepenak]], a former professional [[American football|football]] player and Wilkes-Barre native, was sentenced to 24 months in prison for accepting a bribe, unrelated to his involvement with the for-profit juvenile detention center.&lt;ref name=&quot;newsbank-2010218&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:PIXB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=12CAF88F214DCD78&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420|title=Luzerne Commissioner Skrepenak resigns and will plead guilty |accessdate=August 14, 2010|date=December 18, 2009|work=[[The Progress-Index]]|author=Sisak, Michael R. and Dave Janoski}}{{dead link|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ciavarella and Conahan withdrew their guilty pleas.

==Geography==
Wilkes-Barre is located at {{Coord|41.244581|-75.877918|type:city_region:US|format=dms|display=inline}}.{{GR|1}}

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|7.2|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|6.8|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|0.3|sqmi}}, or 4.60%, is water. While the [[Susquehanna River]] has a wide [[floodplain]] that has necessitated the construction of [[floodwall]]s to protect a large percentage of the city, the areas away from the river increase in elevation approaching Wilkes-Barre Mountain. The elevation of the downtown is about {{convert|550|ft}} above sea level.

===Neighborhoods===
According Wilkes-Barre.pa.us, Wilkes-Barre houses 12 official neighborhoods, which are:

====Downtown====
(The 16 blocks)-This is where it all started. The area now referred to as &quot;Downtown&quot;, between South and North Streets, and bordered by River Street and Wilkes-Barre Boulevard to the West and East respectively is the original foundation of Wilkes-Barre, the 16 blocks claimed by the Connecticut settlers who founded the city. Throughout the city's history, the area has remained a hub for all of Luzerne County. During the city's boom, this small area was home to the headquarters of more than 100 national corporations. Today, it still houses the NEPA Headquarters for Verizon, Citizen's Bank, Blue Cross, PNC Bank, Luzerne National Bank, Guard Insurance, and a number of other companies. An estimated 40,000 people live and/or work in Downtown Wilkes-Barre every day.

====North End====
This is the area directly Northwest of Downtown. It comprises a number of urban and suburban communities, and is renowned for its interesting and beautiful architecture.

====Parsons====
This is a more quiet part of town that almost feels like a suburb. It houses 2 city parks, a golf course, and a number of factories.

====Miners' Mills====
Named after an early prominent local family, it is the last neighborhood on the Northern border of the city.

South Wilkes-Barre -
This is the area directly southwest of Downtown. Home to the national headquarters of Planter's Peanuts and the Bell Telephone Company in the 20th Century. The tallest church in Luzerne County, St Nicholas Roman Catholic Church, dominates the South End skyline at nearly 200'.

East End -
This is the area directly northeast of Downtown. The East End, along with Heights and Mayflower, are fairly new areas compared to the rest of the city, having only been developed in the 20th Century. Old pictures of the Stegmaier Building (which is the oldest highrise in Wilkes-Barre and the last one on Downtown's eastern border) show that everything east of Downtown was forests and coal mines.

Heights a.k.a. Compton -
This is the area directly east of Downtown centered between East End and Mayflower. It is home to three low-income housing projects, two elderly high-rise apartment buildings, and the AHL team The Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins in Coal St Park.

====Mayflower====
This area is located southeast of Downtown. Once, a wealthy area home to many beautiful mansions owned by various &quot;big wigs&quot;, the area is now a more affordable neighborhood, also housing the OKT, Lincoln Plaza, and Park Avenue residential housing communities. It can be argued that from the high streets of Mayflower, the best view of the downtown skyline can be seen.

Additional neighborhoods include Brookside in the Northern end of the city and Rolling Mill Hill, Iron Triangle, and Goose Island in the southern end of the city. There is also a number of smaller sub-neighborhoods within these neighborhoods that are not officially recognized{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

The city was at one time served by the [[Lehigh Valley Railroad]], [[Central Railroad of New Jersey]], the [[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad]] (later [[Erie Lackawanna Railway]]), [[Delaware and Hudson Railway]], the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]], the [[Wilkes-Barre and Eastern Railroad]], and the [[Lackawanna and Wyoming Valley Railroad]] (known as the Laurel Line). The Wilkes-Barre Traction Company formed a streetcar line from [[Georgetown, Luzerne County, Pennsylvania|Georgetown]] to [[Nanticoke, Pennsylvania|Nanticoke]] and over the river into [[Plymouth, Pennsylvania|Plymouth]] ceasing operations in the mid-1940s. At present, the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] (successor to the Delaware and Hudson) and the Luzerne and Susquehanna Railroad (designated-operator of a county-owned shortline) provide freight service within the city.

The city of '''Lock Haven''' is the [[county seat]] of [[Clinton County, Pennsylvania|Clinton County]], in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Pennsylvania]]. Located near the confluence of the [[West Branch Susquehanna River]] and [[Bald Eagle Creek (West Branch Susquehanna River)|Bald Eagle Creek]], it is the principal city of the Lock Haven, Pennsylvania, [[United States micropolitan area|micropolitan statistical area]], itself part of the [[Williamsport, Pennsylvania|Williamsport]]–Lock Haven [[combined statistical area]]. At the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], Lock Haven's population was 9,772.

Built on a site long favored by pre-European peoples, Lock Haven began in 1833 as a timber town and a haven for loggers, boatmen, and other travelers on the river or the [[Pennsylvania Canal (West Branch Division)|West Branch Canal]]. Resource extraction and efficient transportation financed much of the city's growth through the end of the 19th&amp;nbsp;century. In the 20th&amp;nbsp;century, a [[light aircraft|light-aircraft]] factory, a college, and a paper mill, along with many smaller enterprises, drove the economy. Frequent floods, especially in 1972, damaged local industry and led to a high rate of unemployment in the 1980s.

The city has three sites on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]—[[Memorial Park Site]], a significant pre-European archaeological find; [[Heisey House]], a [[Victorian era|Victorian-era]] museum; and [[Water Street District]], an area with a mix of 19th- and 20th-century architecture. A [[levee]], completed in 1995, protects the city from further flooding. While industry remains important to the city, about a third of Lock Haven's workforce is employed in education, health care, or social services.

== History ==

=== Pre-European ===
The earliest settlers in Pennsylvania arrived from Asia between 12000&amp;nbsp;[[Common Era|BCE]] and 8000&amp;nbsp;BCE, when the glaciers of the Pleistocene [[Pleistocene|Ice Age]] were receding. Fluted point spearheads from this era, known as the [[Paleo-Indians|Paleo-Indian]] Period, have been found in most parts of the state.&lt;ref name=historical&gt;{{cite web | last = Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission | title = Pennsylvania Archaeology: An Introduction | publisher = Commonwealth of Pennsylvania | url = http://www.phmc.state.pa.us/ppet/archaeology/page1.asp?secid=31  | accessdate = November 11, 2009 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080625100450/http://www.phmc.state.pa.us/ppet/archaeology/page1.asp?secid=31 |archivedate = June 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archeological discoveries at the [[Memorial Park Site|Memorial Park Site 36Cn164]] near the confluence of the West Branch Susquehanna River and Bald Eagle Creek collectively span about 8,000&amp;nbsp;years and represent every major prehistoric period from the [[Archaic period in the Americas|Middle Archaic]] to the [[Late Woodland period]].&lt;ref&gt;Schuldenrein, p. 1-1&lt;/ref&gt; Prehistoric cultural periods over that span included the Middle Archaic starting at 6500 BCE; the Late Archaic starting at 3000 BCE; the Early Woodland starting at 1000 BCE; the Middle Woodland starting at 0 CE; and the Late Woodland starting at 900 CE.&lt;ref name = &quot;Richter&quot;&gt;Richter, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; First contact with Europeans occurred in Pennsylvania between 1500 and 1600 CE.&lt;ref name = &quot;Richter&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;At the rough time of first contact, several tribes lived in what later became Pennsylvania. It is not known which tribe made first contact with Europeans.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eighteenth century ===
In the early 18th&amp;nbsp;century, a tribal confederacy known as the Six Nations of the [[Iroquois]], headquartered in New York, ruled the Indian (Native American) tribes of Pennsylvania, including those who lived near what would become Lock Haven. Indian settlements in the area included three [[Lenape|Munsee]] villages on the {{convert|325|acre|km2|adj=on}} Great Island in the West Branch Susquehanna River at the mouth of Bald Eagle Creek. Four Indian trails, the [[Great Island Path]], the [[Great Shamokin Path]], the [[Bald Eagle Creek Path]], and the [[Sinnemahoning Path]], crossed the island, and a fifth, [[Logan's Path]], met Bald Eagle Creek Path a few miles upstream near the mouth of [[Fishing Creek (Bald Eagle Creek)|Fishing Creek]].&lt;ref name=&quot;path&quot;&gt;Wallace, frontispiece (map).&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[French and Indian War]] (1754–63), colonial militiamen on the [[Kittanning Expedition]] destroyed Munsee property on the Great Island and along the West Branch. By 1763, the Munsee had abandoned their island villages and other villages in the area.&lt;ref&gt;Miller (1966), p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The earliest recorded inhabitants of the West Branch Susquehanna River valley were the [[Susquehannock]]s, but they were wiped out by disease and warfare with the Iroquois, and the few members left moved west or were assimilated into other tribes by 1675. After that the Iroquois, who were the nominal rulers of the land but mostly lived in [[New York]] to the north, invited tribes displaced by European settlers to move into the region. These included the Lenape (Delaware), [[Shawnee]], and others. Generally, they moved west into the [[Ohio River]] Valley. For more information see Wallace, Paul A.W. (2005).

[[Image:Big Runaway Map.PNG|thumb|left|alt=Eleven forts were built along or near the West Branch Susquehanna River between Fort Augusta, near the confluence with the North Branch Susquehanna, and Fort Reid at Lock Haven, near the confluence with Bald Eagle Creek.|Map of fortifications and streams in north-central Pennsylvania during the Big Runaway. Modern county borders are shown for orientation.]] With the signing of the first [[Treaty of Fort Stanwix]] in 1768, the British gained control from the Iroquois of lands south of the West Branch. However, white settlers continued to appropriate land, including tracts in and near the future site of Lock Haven, not covered by the treaty. In 1769, Cleary Campbell, the first white settler in the area, built a log cabin near the present site of [[Lock Haven University of Pennsylvania]], and by 1773 William Reed, another settler, had built a cabin surrounded by a stockade and called it Reed's Fort.&lt;ref&gt;Miller (1966), pp. 18, 23&lt;/ref&gt; It was the westernmost of 11 mostly primitive forts along the West Branch; [[Fort Augusta]], at what is now [[Sunbury, Pennsylvania|Sunbury]], was the easternmost and most defensible. In response to settler incursions, and encouraged by the British during the [[American Revolution]] (1775–83), Indians attacked colonists and their settlements along the West Branch. Fort Reed and the other white settlements in the area were temporarily abandoned in 1778 during a general evacuation known as the [[Big Runaway]]. Hundreds of people fled along the river to Fort Augusta, about {{convert|50|mi|km|0}} from Fort Reed; some did not return for five years.&lt;ref&gt;Miller (1966), p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1784, the second [[Treaty of Fort Stanwix (1784)|Treaty of Fort Stanwix]], between the Iroquois and the United States, transferred most of the remaining Indian territory in Pennsylvania, including what would become Lock Haven, to the state.&lt;ref name = &quot;2nd Stanwix&quot;/&gt; The U.S. acquired the last remaining tract, the [[Erie Triangle]], through a separate treaty and sold it to Pennsylvania in 1792.&lt;ref name = &quot;2nd Stanwix&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last = Day | first = Sherman | title = Historical collections of the State of Pennsylvania  |url = http://books.google.com/?id=ePzzh7IIPjAC&amp;pg=PA449&amp;lpg=PA449&amp;dq=treaty+of+fort+stanwix+pennsylvania&amp;q=treaty%20of%20fort%20stanwix%201784 | publisher = George W.

=== Nineteenth century ===
Lock Haven was laid out as a town in 1833,&lt;ref name=&quot;PHMC early&quot;/&gt; and it became the county seat in 1839, when the county was created out of parts of [[Lycoming County, Pennsylvania|Lycoming]] and [[Centre County, Pennsylvania|Centre]] counties.&lt;ref&gt;Linn (1883), p. 489&lt;/ref&gt; Incorporated as a [[borough]] in 1840 and as a city in 1870,&lt;ref name=&quot;PHMC early&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Clinton County – 7th class |publisher = Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission |url =http://www.phmc.state.pa.us/BAH/DAM/counties/pdfs/Clinton.pdf | format = PDF |accessdate = November 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lock Haven prospered in the 19th&amp;nbsp;century largely because of timber and transportation. The forests of Clinton County and counties upriver held a huge supply of white pine and hemlock as well as oak, ash, maple, poplar, cherry, beech, and magnolia. The wood was used locally for such things as frame houses, shingles, canal boats, and wooden bridges, and whole logs were floated to [[Chesapeake Bay]] and on to [[Baltimore]], to make [[spar (sailing)|spar]]s for ships. [[Log driving]] and [[Timber rafting|log rafting]], competing forms of transporting logs to [[sawmill]]s, began along the West Branch around 1800. By 1830, slightly before the founding of the town, the lumber industry was well established.&lt;ref&gt;Miller (1966), pp. 109–111&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Canal Monument in Lock Haven Pennsylvania.JPG||thumb|right|Canal monument incorporating old lock in downtown Lock Haven|alt=A stone and metal monument and stone retaining walls commemorate a former canal lock. A sidewalk runs by the memorial and between the retaining walls on a lush bed of grass.]] The [[Pennsylvania Canal (West Branch Division)|West Branch Canal]], which opened in 1834, ran {{convert|73|mi|km|0}} from [[Northumberland, Pennsylvania|Northumberland]] to Farrandsville, about {{convert|5|mi|km|0}} upstream from Lock Haven. A state-funded extension called the Bald Eagle Cut ran from the West Branch through Lock Haven and [[Flemington, Pennsylvania|Flemington]] to Bald Eagle Creek. A privately funded extension, the [[Bald Eagle and Spring Creek Navigation]], eventually reached [[Bellefonte, Pennsylvania|Bellefonte]], {{convert|24|mi|km|0}} upstream. Lock Haven's founder, Jeremiah Church, and his brother, Willard, chose the town site in 1833 partly because of the river, the creek, and the canal. Church named the town ''Lock Haven'' because it had a canal [[Lock (water transport)|lock]] and because it was a haven for loggers, boatmen, and other travelers. Over the next quarter century, canal boats {{convert|12|ft|m|0}} wide and {{convert|80|ft|m|0}} long carried passengers and mail as well as cargo such as coal, ashes for lye and soap, firewood, food, furniture, dry goods, and clothing. A rapid increase in Lock Haven's population (to 830 by 1850)&lt;ref&gt;Wagner (1979), p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; followed the opening of the canal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller 1966, pp. 44–46&quot;&gt;Miller (1966), pp. 44–46&lt;/ref&gt;

A Lock Haven [[log boom]], smaller than but otherwise similar to the [[Susquehanna Boom]] at Williamsport, was constructed in 1849. Large cribs of timbers weighted with tons of stone were arranged in the pool behind the [[Dunnstown, Pennsylvania|Dunnstown]] Dam, named for a settlement on the shore opposite Lock Haven. The piers, about {{convert|150|ft|m|0}} from one another, stretched in a line from the dam to a point {{convert|3|mi|km|0}} upriver. Connected by timbers shackled together with iron yokes and rings, the piers anchored an enclosure into which the river current forced floating logs. Workers called ''boom rats'' sorted the captured logs, branded like cattle, for delivery to sawmills and other owners. Lock Haven became the lumber center of Clinton County and the site of many businesses related to forest products.&lt;ref&gt;Miller (1966), pp. 111–119&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Philadelphia and Erie Railroad|Sunbury and Erie Railroad]], renamed the Philadelphia and Erie Railroad in 1861, reached Lock Haven in 1859, and with it came a building boom. Hoping that the area's coal, iron ore, white pine, and high-quality clay would produce significant future wealth, railroad investors led by Christopher and John Fallon financed a line to Lock Haven. On the strength of the railroad's potential value to the city, local residents had invested heavily in housing, building large homes between 1854 and 1856. Although the Fallons' coal and iron ventures failed, [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]], [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek Revival]], and [[Italianate architecture|Italianate]] mansions and commercial buildings such as the Fallon House, a large hotel, remained, and the railroad provided a new mode of transport for the ongoing timber era. A second rail line, the [[Bald Eagle Valley Railroad]], originally organized as the Tyrone and Lock Haven Railroad and completed in the 1860s, linked Lock Haven to [[Tyrone, Pennsylvania|Tyrone]], {{convert|56|mi|km|0}} to the southwest. The two rail lines soon became part of the network controlled by the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]].&lt;ref&gt;Wagner (1979), pp. 9–60&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lock Haven Log Rafts.png|left|thumb|Log rafts in the late 19th&amp;nbsp;century line the north bank of the West Branch Susquehanna River at Lock Haven.

A row of houses lines the river bank, at the bottom of hill paralleling the river. Two men are standing on one of the rafts.]] During the era of log floating, logjams sometimes occurred when logs struck an obstacle. Log rafts floating down the West Branch had to pass through chutes in canal dams. The rafts were commonly {{convert|28|ft|m|0}} wide—narrow enough to pass through the chutes—and {{convert|150|ft|m|0}} to {{convert|200|ft|m|0}} long.&lt;ref name=theiss&gt;{{cite journal

The jam eventually trapped another 200&amp;nbsp;log rafts, and 2&amp;nbsp;canal boats, ''The Mammoth of Newport'' and ''The Sarah Dunbar''.&lt;ref&gt;Miller (1966), pp. 119–120&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of [[board foot|board feet]], the peak of the lumber era in Pennsylvania arrived in about 1885, when {{nowrap|1.9 million logs}} went through the boom at Williamsport. These logs produced a total of about {{nowrap|226 million board feet}} (533,000&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) of sawed lumber. After that, production steadily declined throughout the state.&lt;ref name=theiss/&gt; Lock Haven's timber business was also affected by flooding, which badly damaged the canals and destroyed the log boom in 1889.&lt;ref name = &quot;Miller 59&quot;/&gt;

The Central State Normal School, established to train teachers for central Pennsylvania, held its first classes in 1877 at a site overlooking the West Branch Susquehanna River. The small school, with enrollments below 150 until the 1940s, eventually became Lock Haven University of Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name = lhuphistory&gt;{{cite web | title = Lock Haven University: A Brief History | publisher = Lock Haven University | url = http://www.lhup.edu/library2/archive/briefhistory.htm | accessdate = October 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1880s, the New York and Pennsylvania Paper Mill in [[Castanea Township, Clinton County, Pennsylvania|Castanea Township]] near Flemington began paper production on the site of a former sawmill; the [[paper mill]] remained a large employer until the end of the 20th&amp;nbsp;century.

As older forms of transportation such as the canal boat disappeared, new forms arose. One of these, the [[tram|electric trolley]], began operation in Lock Haven in 1894. The Lock Haven Electric Railway, managed by the Lock Haven Traction Company and after 1900 by the Susquehanna Traction Company, ran passenger trolleys between Lock Haven and [[Mill Hall, Pennsylvania|Mill Hall]], about {{convert|3|mi|km|0}} to the west. The trolley line extended from the [[Philadelphia and Erie Railroad]] station in Lock Haven to a station of the [[Central Railroad of Pennsylvania (1891–1918)|Central Railroad of Pennsylvania]], which served Mill Hall. The route went through Lock Haven's downtown, close to the Normal School, across town to the trolley car barn on the southwest edge of the city, through Flemington, over the Bald Eagle Canal and Bald Eagle Creek, and on to Mill Hall via what was then known as the Lock Haven, Bellefonte, and [[Nittany Valley]] Turnpike. Plans to extend the line from Mill Hall to Salona, {{convert|3|mi|km|0}} miles south of Mill Hall, and to [[Avis, Pennsylvania|Avis]] {{convert|10|mi|km|0}} northeast of Lock Haven, were never carried out, and the line remained unconnected to other trolley lines. The system, always financially marginal, declined after World War I. Losing business to automobiles and buses, it ceased operations around 1930.&lt;ref&gt;Shieck (1978), pp. 81–92&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Piper Aviation Museum 2.jpg|thumb|left|Piper Aviation Museum|alt=A white van is parked in front of a rectangular three-story building with many windows. A sign on the building says, &quot;Piper Aviation Museum&quot;.]] [[William T. Piper]], Sr., built the [[Piper Aircraft]] Corporation factory in Lock Haven in 1937 after the company's Taylor Aircraft manufacturing plant in [[Bradford, Pennsylvania]], was destroyed by fire. The factory began operations in a building that once housed a silk mill.&lt;ref name=plan&gt;{{cite web | last = City of Lock Haven Planning Office | coauthors = Clinton County Comprehensive Planning Advisory Committee; Gannett Fleming, Inc.; Larson Design Group | title = Comprehensive Plan Update (2005) | publisher = City of Lock Haven | url = http://www.lockhavencity.org/ | accessdate = September 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the company grew, the original factory expanded to include engineering and office buildings. Piper remained in the city until 1984, when its new owner, [[EG&amp;G#Lear Siegler Services.2C Inc.|Lear-Siegler]], moved production to [[Vero Beach, Florida]]. The Clinton County Historical Society opened the Piper Aviation Museum at the site of the former factory in 1985, and 10&amp;nbsp;years later the museum became an independent organization.&lt;ref name=&quot;plan&quot;/&gt;

The state of Pennsylvania acquired Central State Normal School in 1915 and renamed it Lock Haven State Teachers College in 1927. Between 1942 and 1970, the student population grew from 146 to more than 2,300; the number of teaching faculty rose from 25 to 170, and the college carried out a large building program. The school's name was changed to Lock Haven State College in 1960, and its emphasis shifted to include the humanities, fine arts, mathematics, and social sciences, as well as teacher education. Becoming Lock Haven University of Pennsylvania in 1983, it opened a branch campus in [[Clearfield, Pennsylvania|Clearfield]], {{convert|48|mi|km|0}} west of Lock Haven, in 1989.&lt;ref name=lhuphistory/&gt;

An {{convert|8|acre|ha|adj=on}} industrial area in Castanea Township adjacent to Lock Haven was placed on the National Priorities List of uncontrolled hazardous waste sites (commonly referred to as [[Superfund]] sites) in 1982. Drake Chemical, which went bankrupt in 1981, made ingredients for pesticides and other compounds at the site from the 1960s to 1981. Starting in 1982, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] began a clean-up of contaminated containers, buildings, and soils at the site and by the late 1990s had replaced the soils. Equipment to treat contaminated groundwater at the site was installed in 2000 and continues to operate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Mid-Atlantic Superfund: Drake Chemical: Current Site Information | publisher = U.S. Environmental Protection Agency | url = http://www.epa.gov/reg3hwmd/npl/PAD003058047.htm | accessdate = October 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Floods ===
[[File:Lock Haven Bridge panorama.jpg|thumb|Since 1995 a levee protects Lock Haven from the West Branch Susquehanna River.|alt=A large, smooth river crossed by a modern bridge. The left bank is tree lined, the right is a levee, a long mountain ridge is in the background.]]
Pennsylvania's streams have frequently flooded. According to William H. Shank, the Indians of Pennsylvania warned white settlers that great floods occurred on the Delaware and Susquehanna rivers every 14&amp;nbsp;years. Shank tested this idea by tabulating the highest floods on record at key points throughout the state over a 200-year period and found that a major flood had occurred, on average, once every 25&amp;nbsp;years between 1784 and 1972. Big floods recorded at [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]], on the [[main stem]] of the Susquehanna about {{convert|120|mi|km|0}} miles downstream from Lock Haven, occurred in 1784, 1865, 1889, 1894, 1902, 1936, and 1972. Readings from the Williamsport [[stream gauge]], {{convert|24|mi|km|0}} miles below Lock Haven on the West Branch of the Susquehanna, showed major flooding between 1889 and 1972 in the same years as the Harrisburg station; in addition, a large flood occurred on the West Branch at Williamsport in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;Shank (1972), pp. 10–13&lt;/ref&gt; Estimated flood-crest readings between 1847 and 1979—based on data from the [[National Weather Service]] flood gauge at Lock Haven—show that flooding likely occurred in the city 19&amp;nbsp;times in 132&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name = &quot;Schuldenrein table&quot;&gt;Schuldenrein, Table 2-1&lt;/ref&gt; The biggest flood occurred on March 18, 1936, when the river crested at {{convert|32.3|ft|m}}, which was about {{convert|11|ft|m}} above the flood stage of {{convert|21|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name = &quot;Schuldenrein table&quot;/&gt;

The third biggest flood, cresting at {{convert|29.8|ft|m}} in Lock Haven, occurred on June 1, 1889,&lt;ref name = &quot;Schuldenrein table&quot;/&gt; and coincided with the [[Johnstown Flood]]. The flood demolished Lock Haven's log boom, and millions of feet of stored timber were swept away.&lt;ref&gt;Shank (1972), pp. 22–23&lt;/ref&gt; The flood damaged the canals, which were subsequently abandoned, and destroyed the last of the canal boats based in the city.&lt;ref name = &quot;Miller 59&quot;&gt;Miller (1966), p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Agnes 1972 track.png|thumb|left|Track of Hurricane Agnes|alt=A color-coded chart shows that Hurricane Agnes began as a tropical depression over the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico, turned sharply northward and became a tropical storm after entering the Caribbean Sea. It gained hurricane strength as it crossed the Gulf of Mexico but weakened to a tropical depression again after striking the U.S. mainland and turning to the northeast. After crossing several southeastern states, it entered the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of North Carolina and regained tropical-storm strength. It then curved back to the northwest and, striking the mainland again, it passed close to Pennsylvania.]] The most damaging Lock Haven flood was caused by the remnants of [[Hurricane Agnes]] in 1972. The storm, just below hurricane strength when it reached the region, made landfall on June 22 near New York City. Agnes merged with a non-tropical low on June 23, and the combined system affected the northeastern United States until June 25. The combination produced widespread rains of {{convert|6|to|12|in|mm|0}} with local amounts up to {{convert|19|in|mm|0}} in western [[Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania|Schuylkill County]], about {{convert|75|mi|km|0}} southeast of Lock Haven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Federal, state, and local governments began construction in 1992 of barriers to protect the city. The project included a levee of {{convert|36000|ft|m|0}} and a [[flood wall]] of {{convert|1000|ft|m|0}} along the Susquehanna River and Bald Eagle Creek, closure structures, [[retention basin]]s, a [[pumping station]], and some relocation of roads and buildings. Completed in 1995, the levee protected the city from high water in the year of the [[Blizzard of 1996]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Statewide Floods in Pennsylvania, January 1996 | publisher = United States Geological Survey | url = http://water.usgs.gov/wid/FS_103-96/FS_103-96.html | date = April 10, 1996 | accessdate = November 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and again 2004, when rainfall from the remnants of [[Hurricane Ivan]] threatened the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yowell&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last = Yowell | first = Robert | title = Intergovernmental Success in Multi-Component Flood Mitigation: The Lock Haven Flood Protection Project Experience | journal = [[Journal of Contemporary Water Research and Education]] | issue = 129 | pages = 46–48 | month = March | year = 2005 | url = http://www.ucowr.siu.edu/updates/130/11%20yowell.pdf | accessdate = September 16, 2007|format=PDF|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070713141700/http://www.ucowr.siu.edu/updates/130/11%20yowell.pdf |archivedate = July 13, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It says, &quot;A family includes a householder and one or more people living in the same household who are related to the householder by birth, marriage, or adoption... [However,] [n]ot all households contain families since a household may comprise a group of unrelated people or one person living alone.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Lock Haven's economy, from the city's founding in 1833 until the end of the 19th century, depended heavily on natural resources, particularly timber, and on cheap transportation to eastern markets.&lt;ref name=&quot;plan&quot; /&gt; Loggers used the Susquehanna River and Bald Eagle Creek to float timber to sawmills in Lock Haven and nearby towns. The West Branch Canal, reaching the city in 1834, connected to large markets downstream, and shorter canals along Bald Eagle Creek added other connections.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller 1966, pp. 44–46&quot;/&gt; In 1859, the first railroad arrived in Lock Haven, spurring trade and economic growth.&lt;ref name=&quot;plan&quot;/&gt;

By 1900, the lumber industry had declined, and the city's economic base rested on other industries, including a furniture factory, a paper mill, a fire brick plant, and a silk mill. In 1938, the [[Piper Aircraft Corporation]], maker of the [[Piper J-3|Piper Cub]] and other light aircraft, moved its production plant to Lock Haven. It remained one of the city's biggest employers until the 1980s, when, after major flood damage and losses related to Hurricane Agnes in 1972, it moved to Florida.&lt;ref name=&quot;plan&quot;/&gt; The loss of Piper Aircraft contributed to an unemployment rate of more than 20% in Lock Haven in the early 1980s, though the rate had declined to about 9% by 2000. Another large plant, the paper mill that had operated since the 1880s&lt;ref&gt;Wagner (1979), p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; in Castanea Township, closed in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Associated Press | title = Plan to Close Paper Mill Staggers Lock Haven | work = Reading Eagle | publisher = Google News| date =October 18, 2000 | url = http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&amp;dat=20001019&amp;id=OIs0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=g6MFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5678,1067302 | accessdate = April 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2005, 32% of the city's labor force was employed in health care, education, or social services, 16% in manufacturing, 14% in retail trade, 13% in arts, entertainment, recreation, accommodation, and food services, and smaller fractions in other sectors. The city's biggest employers, Lock Haven University of Pennsylvania and Lock Haven Hospital, are among the seven biggest employers in Clinton County.&lt;ref name=&quot;plan&quot;/&gt;

'''Latrobe''' {{IPAc-en|l|eɪ|ˈ|t|r|oʊ|b}} is a [[city]] in [[Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania|Westmoreland County]], [[Pennsylvania]] in the [[United States]], approximately {{convert|40|mi|km}} southeast of [[Pittsburgh]].

The city population was 8,944 as of the 2000 census (9,265 in 1990). It is located near Pennsylvania's scenic [[Chestnut Ridge (Laurel Highlands)|Chestnut Ridge]]. Latrobe was incorporated as a [[Borough (Pennsylvania)|borough]] in 1854, and as a city in 1999. The current Mayor is Barbara Griffin.

Among its claims to fame, Latrobe is the home of the [[Latrobe Brewing Company|Latrobe Brewery]] (the original brewer of [[Rolling Rock]] beer), [[Saint Vincent College]], and [[golf]]er [[Arnold Palmer]]. It was the childhood home of [[Fred Rogers]], children's television personality who was buried there in Unity Cemetery after his death in 2003. In addition, it is the birthplace of [[trumpeter]] [[Dennis Ferry]]. While it was believed for years that the first professional [[American football|football]] game was played in Latrobe, the city's claim was refused induction into the Hall of Fame records.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;After the Pro Football Hall of Fame was opened in 1963 in Canton, further research uncovered the Pudge Heffelfinger payment by the Allegheny Athletic Association in 1892 and thus negated the Latrobe claim as the birthplace of pro football.&quot; Pro Football Hall Of Fame.  History.  November 12: The Birth of Pro Football. link:http://www.profootballhof.com/history/general/birth.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Latrobe is also home of the first [[banana split]], invented in Latrobe by David Strickler in 1904{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}. Latrobe is home to the [[training camp]] of the six time Super Bowl champion, [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]. Also, comedian [[Jackie Mason]] spent three years as a rabbi in Latrobe after his ordination.

In May 2006, [[Anheuser-Busch]] purchased the [[Rolling Rock]] brands, but not the brewery. In June 2006, [[City Brewing Company]] from [[LaCrosse, Wisconsin|La Crosse, Wisconsin]] entered into negotiations to buy the brewery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wisconsin brewer may buy Rolling Rock plant|publisher=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|date=June 22, 2006|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06173/700216-28.stm|accessdate=June 25, 2006 | first=Len | last=Boselovic}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2006, City Brewing Company agreed to purchase the brewery,&lt;ref&gt;[http://pittsburgh.bizjournals.com/pittsburgh/stories/2006/09/25/daily31.html City Brewery buys Latrobe Brewery] - [[Pittsburgh Business Times]]&lt;/ref&gt; and they licensed it to the Boston Beer Company in April 2007 as a satellite brewery to produce [[Samuel Adams (beer)|Samuel Adams beers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/07094/774830-28.stm | work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | title=Samuel Adams comes calling on Latrobe brewer | first=Len | last=Boselovic | date=April 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sam Adams production did not last long. The plant is currently brewing [[Iron City Brewing Company|Iron City Beer]] under contract. In addition, Duquesne Bottling Company has brewed the revived [http://duquesnebeer.com/ Duquesne Beer], &quot;The Prince of Pilseners&quot;, at the Latrobe plant.

==History==

In 1852, Oliver Barnes (a civil engineer for the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]]) laid out the plans for the community that was incorporated in 1854 as the Borough of Latrobe. Barnes named the town for his best friend and college classmate, [[Benjamin Henry Latrobe, II|Benjamin Latrobe]], who was a civil engineer for the [[B&amp;O Railroad]]. (His father, [[Benjamin Henry Latrobe]], was the architect who rebuilt the [[United States Capitol]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] after the [[War of 1812]].)

Its location along the route of the Pennsylvania Railroad helped Latrobe develop into a significant industrial hub. Latrobe was also served by the [[Ligonier Valley Railroad]] from 1877 to 1952.

In 1904, the [[banana split]] was invented in Latrobe by David Evans Strickler at Strickler's Drug Store.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turback&quot;&gt;Turback, Michael (March 2004). ''The Banana Split Book''. Camino Books. ISBN 094015983&lt;/ref&gt;

Two [[interurban]] (long-distance trolley) lines served Latrobe: The ''Westmoreland County Railway Company'' connected Latrobe to Derry, operating 1904 to 1932.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Muller | first = Edward K. | authorlink = | coauthors = Ronald C.

Service ceased in 1952.&lt;ref name='WPR'/&gt;

Latrobe has two sites on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] within its city boundaries:

* [[Latrobe (Amtrak station)|''Pennsylvania Railroad Station at Latrobe'']] (325 McKinley Avenue): This station was built by the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arch.state.pa.us/ |title=National Register of Historical Places - Pennsylvania Railroad Station at Latrobe |accessdate=2008-09-15 |format=PDF |work=ARCH: Pennsylvania's Historic Architecture &amp; Archeology |publisher=Pennsylvania Museum and Historical Commission }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Citizens National Bank of Latrobe]] (816 Ligonier Street): At six stories, this is the city’s tallest building, previously known as the [[Mellon Bank]] Building. This 1926 structure was designed by the Greensburg firm of [[Paul Bartholomew|Batholomew &amp; Smith]].&lt;ref name=&quot;arch&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.dot7.state.pa.us/ce/SelectWelcome.asp| title = National Historic Landmarks &amp; National Register of Historic Places in Pennsylvania| publisher = CRGIS: Cultural Resources Geographic Information System| format = Searchable database}} ''Note:'' This includes {{cite web| url = https://www.dot7.state.pa.us/ce_imagery/phmc_scans/H118662_01H.PDF| title = National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination Form: Citizens National Bank of Latrobe | accessdate = 2012-06-10| author = Clinton Piper| format = PDF| date= May 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early professional football team===
[[Image:1897 Latrobe.jpg|230px|right|thumb|Latrobe's Pro Football Team in 1897]]
From 1895 until 1909, Latrobe was the home of the [[Latrobe Athletic Association]], one of the earliest professional [[American football|football]] teams. The team's [[quarterback]], [[John Brallier]], became the first football player to admit playing for money. In 1895 he accepted $10 and expenses to play for Latrobe in a 12-0 victory over the [[Jeannette Athletic Club]]. Brallier was thought to be the very first professional football player, until the 1960s. It was then, that documents surfaced showing that [[William Heffelfinger|William &quot;Pudge&quot; Heffelfinger]], a former three-time [[All-American]] from [[Yale University|Yale]], was employed to play [[Guard (American football)|guard]] for the [[Allegheny Athletic Association]] three years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Five Hundred Reasons| journal=Coffin Corner | publisher=Professional Football Researchers Association | volume= | issue= | year= | pages=1–6 |url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Articles/Five_Hundred_Reasons.pdf| authors=PFRA Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1897, Latrobe was the first football team to play a full season with a team composed entirely of professional players. In 1898 Latrobe and two players from their rivals, the [[Greensburg Athletic Association]], formed [[1898 Western Pennsylvania All-Star football team|the very first professional football all-star team]] for a game against the [[Duquesne Country and Athletic Club]], to be played at Pittsburgh's [[Exposition Park (Pittsburgh)|Exposition Park]]. Duquesne went on to win the game 16-0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Stars Over All-Stars | journal= | publisher=Professional Football Researchers Association | volume= | issue=Annual | year= | pages=1–5 | url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Articles/Stars_Over_All_Stars.pdf | author=PFRA Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 18, 1905, Latrobe defeated the [[Canton Bulldogs]], which later became a founding member, and two-time champion, of the [[National Football League]], 6-0.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite journal | title=Latrobe, PA: Cradle of Pro Football| journal=Coffin Corner | publisher=Professional Football Researchers Association | volume=2 | issue=Annual | year=1980 | pages=1–21 | url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Coffin_Corner/02-An-052.pdf| first=Robert | last=Van Atta}}
&lt;/ref&gt; 

Aside from Brallier, the Latrobe Athletic Association included several of the era's top players, such as: [[Ed Abbaticchio]], [[Charles L. Barney|Charles Barney]], [[Alfred E. Bull|Alf Bull]], [[Jack Gass]], [[Walter R. Okeson|Walter Okeson]], [[Harry Ryan (American football)|Harry Ryan]], [[Thomas Trenchard|Doggie Trenchard]], [[Eddie Wood]] and manager [[Dave Berry (American football)|Dave Berry]].

==History==
[[File:Washington PA City Hall.jpg|thumb|left|City Hall in Washington, PA]]
[[File:George Washington Hotel Pa.jpg|thumb|left|George Washington Hotel]]
[[Delaware Indian]] [[tribal chief|chief]] [[Tangooqua]], commonly known as &quot;Catfish&quot;, had a camp on a branch of [[Chartiers Creek]] in what is now part of the city of Washington.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walkinshaw&quot;&gt;Walkinshaw, Lewis Clark (c. 1939). ''Annals of southwestern Pennsylvania, Vol. 1''. New York. Lewis Historical Publishing Company, Inc, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; The French labeled the area &quot;Wissameking&quot;, meaning &quot;catfish place&quot;, as early as 1757.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walkinshaw&quot;/&gt; The area of Washington was settled by many immigrants from [[Scotland]] and the north of [[Ireland]] along with settlers from eastern and central parts of colonial [[Virginia]].  It was first settled by colonists around 1768.

The Pennsylvania General Assembly passed an act on March 28, 1781, erecting the County of Washington and naming &quot;Catfish Camp&quot; as the place for holding the first election. This was the first county in the U.S. to be named in honor of General [[George Washington]]. David Hoge laid out a plan of lots immediately after the legislature's action. His original plot carried the name &quot;Bassett, alias Dandridge Town,&quot; but before the plot was recorded, lines were drawn through &quot;Bassett, alias Dandridge Town&quot; with ink, and the word &quot;Washington&quot; was written above. There have long been rumors among locals that the town was named “Washington” because George Washington spent the night in the region once. This is not true however; Washington had never been to the area.

The original plot dedicated a tract of ground to the people for recreational purposes. A lot was given for a [[courthouse]] where the [[Washington County Courthouse (Pennsylvania)|current building]] now stands, and Lots 43 and 102, according to the plan, were presented by Hoge to &quot;His Excellency, General Washington, and Mrs. Washington.&quot;

Washington, Pennsylvania, was the center for the '[[Whiskey Rebellion]]' of 1791, which was one of the first open rebellions against the new U.S. government and Constitution. The rebellion was centered around a [[tax]] being imposed on [[whiskey]] distillation in the region. The house of [[David Bradford (lawyer)|David Bradford]], one of the leaders of the rebellion, is now a museum devoted to the Whiskey Rebellion, the [[David Bradford House]], located on South Main Street of the city.

The town was incorporated as a borough on February 13, 1810, and became a city of the third class in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpa.us/general_info-history.html City of Washington home page]&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1875, construction began of the {{railgauge|36}} [[Waynesburg and Washington Railroad]], conceived by John Day in 1874 and chartered in 1875.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.narrowtracks.com/wwrr/ArronWW.htm |title=The Waynesburg and Washington RR |year=2003 |accessdate=December 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Passenger services ended in 1929, conversion to [[standard gauge]] followed in 1944, when it was renamed the Waynesburg Secondary. Freight services ended in 1976, although part of the line still survives for access to a coal mine.

James B. Wilson chartered The Washington Electric Street Railways in 1889 with construction beginning in November 1890. The first line was built from the Waynesburg and Washington Narrow Gauge station to Wilson Orchard, just north of the present day site of the Washington Hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HHxiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Z3cNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3197%2C2582361 |newspaper=Observer Reporter |location=Washington, Pennsylvania |date=August 15, 1983 |accessdate=December 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1903 the Washington and Canonsburg Railway Company linked the two towns with a trolley line. The company was bought by the ''Philadelphia Company'' in 1906, later becoming part of the [[Pittsburgh Railways|Pittsburgh Railway Company]], linking through to Pittsburgh as part of their [[interurban]] service in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Canonsburg - Images of America |last=Grefenstette |first=Jerry |year=2009 |publisher=Arcadia Publishing |isbn=0-7385-6533-4 |page=46 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=vr31Qfo34g0C |accessdate=October 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The line closed on August 29, 1953. A short section of the line and a number of trolley cars are preserved at the [[Pennsylvania Trolley Museum]] north of the city.

==Current projects==
The city of Washington is currently working to improve the social conditions of the community through a $14-million street-scape improvement project that will significantly improve the infrastructure of downtown Washington. Along with the infrastructure improvements, [[Millcraft Industries]] has announced a $100 million revitalization project for downtown Washington.

As part of the revitalization, Land America is currently building a new 7 story office building at the corner of Beau and Franklin streets in Washington. Land America is expected to take about {{convert|100000|sqft|m2|-4}} of the seven-story, {{convert|140000|sqft|m2|-3|sing=on}} building for its corporate headquarters, and will employ up to 1,000 people in the building upon completion in December 2006.   With the bankruptcy of Land America in 2008, this project was cancelled.

Other aspects of the Crossroads Project include street level retail, residential lofts, an 80-room hotel, and an outdoor park and amphitheatre.  In addition, the Carl Walker Construction Co. will build an $12 million, 850-space parking garage between Chestnut and Beau streets to accommodate the office building.

'''Scranton''' is a city in [[Northeastern Pennsylvania|the northeastern part of]] [[Pennsylvania]], [[United States]]. It is the [[county seat]] of [[Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania|Lackawanna County]]{{GR|6}} and the largest principal city in the [[Scranton/Wilkes-Barre metropolitan area]]. Scranton had a population of 76,089 in 2010, according to the [[2010 United States Census|U.S. Census]], making it Pennsylvania's sixth-most-populous city after [[Philadelphia]], [[Pittsburgh]], [[Allentown, Pennsylvania|Allentown]], [[Erie, Pennsylvania|Erie]], and [[Reading, Pennsylvania|Reading]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Scr1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/popest/cities/tables/SUB-EST2007-04-42.csv |title=Table 4: Annual Estimates of the Population for Incorporated Places in Pennsylvania, Listed Alphabetically: April 1, 2000 to July 1, 2007 |date= |accessdate=2011-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scranton is the geographic and cultural center of the [[Lackawanna River]] valley, and the largest of the former [[anthracite coal]] mining communities in a contiguous quilt-work that also includes [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania|Wilkes-Barre]], [[Pittston, Pennsylvania|Pittston]], and [[Carbondale, Pennsylvania|Carbondale]]. Scranton was incorporated as a [[borough]] on February 14, 1856, and as a [[city]] on April 23, 1866. Scranton became known as the Electric City when electric lights were introduced at Dickson Locomotive Works in 1880.{{cn|date=November 2013}} Six years later, the nation's first successful, continuously operating electrified [[streetcar]]s began operating in the city. 

Scranton is also home to a regional branch of [[Dunder Mifflin]], the fictional paper company featured in the television series ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Electric City&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Cheryl A Kashuba |url=http://thetimes-tribune.com/news/scranton-gained-fame-as-the-electric-city-thanks-to-the-region-s-innovative-spirit-1.965641 |title=Scranton gained fame as the Electric City, thanks to the region's innovative spirit - News |publisher=The Times-Tribune |date=2010-08-22 |accessdate=2012-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Residents of Scranton are referred to as &quot;Scrantonians&quot;. 
==History==

===Humble beginnings (1776–1845)===
Present-day Scranton and its surrounding area had been inhabited by the native [[Lenape|Lenape tribe]], from whose language &quot;Lackawanna&quot; (or &quot;lac-a-wa-na&quot;, meaning &quot;stream that forks&quot;) is derived. In 1778, Isaac Tripp, known as the area's first white settler, built his home here; it still stands in the city's Tripp park section. More settlers from  [[New England]] came to the area in the late 18th century, gradually establishing mills and other small businesses in a village that became known as Slocum Hollow. 

===Industries arrive (1846–1899)===
[[Image:George Inness 003.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Scranton in 1855, as depicted by [[George Inness]]'s painting of the [[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad]] [[roundhouse]].]]
[[Image:Scranton-1.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Scranton, as depicted on an 1890 panoramic map]] Though [[anthracite coal]] was being mined in Carbondale to the north and Wilkes-Barre to the south, the industries that precipitated the city's growth were [[iron]] and [[steel]]. In 1840, brothers Selden T. and [[George W. Scranton]] founded what would become the [[Lackawanna Steel Company]]. On October 8, 1845, the Montour Iron Works in [[Danville, Pennsylvania]], produced the first iron [[T-rail]]s made in America, offering the first domestic competition to [[United Kingdom|British]] exports. The Scrantons' firm followed suit two years later, making rails for the [[Erie Railroad]] in New York state, and soon became a major producer.

In 1851, the Scrantons founded the [[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad]] (DL&amp;W) to transport iron and coal products from the Lackawanna valley. The Pennsylvania Coal Company built a [[gravity railroad]] here for the same purpose. In 1856, the Borough of Scranton was officially incorporated. The [[Delaware and Hudson]] (D&amp;H) Canal Company, which had its own gravity railroad from Carbondale to [[Honesdale]], built a [[steam railroad]] that entered Scranton in 1863.

Scranton was incorporated as a city of 35,000 in 1866 in Luzerne County when the surrounding boroughs of Hyde Park (now part of the city's West Side) and Providence (now part of North Scranton) were merged with Scranton. Twelve years later, the city became the county seat of the newly formed Lackawanna County. 

The nation's first successful, continuously operating electrified [[streetcar]] (trolley) system was established in the city in 1886, giving it the nickname &quot;The Electric City&quot;. The Lackawanna and Wyoming Valley Railroad &amp;mdash; commonly known as the Laurel Line &amp;mdash; connected Scranton with neighboring Wilkes-Barre; similar services operated from the nearby towns of Dunmore and Pittston. In 1896, the city's various streetcar companies were consolidated into the [[Scranton Railway|Scranton Railway Company]], which ran trolleys until 1954. (Today, local historical and community groups are trying to restore portions of the original Laurel Line as a tourist attraction.{{cn|date=November 2013}})

By 1890, three other railroads had built lines to tap into the rich supply of coal in and around the city, including the Erie Railroad, the [[Central Railroad of New Jersey]] and finally the [[New York, Ontario and Western Railway]] (NYO&amp;W). Underneath the city, a network of coal veins was mined by workers who were given jobs by the wealthy coal barons with low pay, long hours and unsafe working conditions. Children as young as 8 or 9 worked 14-hour days separating slate from coal in the [[coal breaker|breakers]].

In the late 1890s, Scranton was home to a series of early [[International League]] baseball teams.

===Growth and prosperity (1900–1945)===
By the [[United States Census]] of 1900, the population of Scranton was about 102,026, making it the 38th-largest U.S. city.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/42/4269000.html | title=Scranton(city) QuickFacts| accessdate=2007-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The turn of the 20th century saw many beautiful homes of [[Victorian architecture]] built in the Hill and Green Ridge sections of the city. In 1901, the dwindling local iron ore supply cost the city the industry on which it was founded. The Lackawanna Steel Company moved to [[Lackawanna, New York]], where iron ore was more readily available, thanks to a Great Lakes port that gave it easy access to ore from [[Minnesota]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Scranton forged ahead as the center of Pennsylvania's anthracite coal industry. During the first half of the 20th century, it became home to many groups of new immigrants from [[Eastern Europe]]. This patchwork still survives and is represented by the [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] churches that primarily dot the North Scranton, West Side, and South Side neighborhoods of the city; a substantial Jewish community was established as well. In 1903, an electric [[interurban]] railroad known as the [[Laurel Line]] was started, and two years later connected to nearby Wilkes-Barre, {{convert|20|mi|km}} to the southwest. Working conditions for miners were improved by the efforts of labor leaders like [[John Mitchell (United Mine Workers)|John Mitchell]], who is honored with a statue on the downtown Courthouse Square.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Starting in the early 1920s, the [[Scranton Button Company]] (founded in 1885 and a major maker of shellac buttons) became one of the primary makers of phonograph records. They pressed records for [[Emerson Records|Emerson]] (whom they bought in 1924), as well as [[Regal Records (1921)|Regal]], [[Cameo Records|Cameo]], [[Romeo Records|Romeo]], [[Banner Records|Banner]], [[Domino Records|Domino]], [[Conqueror Records|Conqueror]]. In July 1929, the company merged with Regal, Cameo, Banner, and the U.S. branch of [[Pathe Records|Pathe]] (makers of Pathe and [[Perfect Records|Perfect]]) to become the [[American Record Corporation]]. By 1938, the Scranton company was also pressing records for [[Brunswick Records|Brunswick]], [[Melotone Records (US)|Melotone]], and [[Vocalion Records|Vocalion]]. In 1946, the company was acquired by [[Capitol Records|Capitol]], and continued to produce Capitol Records through the end of the vinyl era.

By the mid-1930s, the city population had swelled beyond 140,000&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;/&gt; thanks largely to the growing mining and [[silk]] textile industries. [[World War II]] created a great demand for energy, which led to more [[mining]] in the area.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

===The end of an era (1946–1984)===
After World War II, coal lost favor to [[oil]] and [[natural gas]]. While some U.S. cities prospered in the post-war boom, the fortunes and population of Scranton (and the rest of Lackawanna and [[Luzerne County, Pennsylvania|Luzerne]] Counties) began to diminish. Coal production and rail traffic declined rapidly throughout the 1950s. In 1952, the Laurel Line ceased passenger service. The Scranton Transit Company, whose trolleys had given the city its nickname, transferred all operations to buses as the 1954 holiday season approached. In 1955, some eastern and southern parts of the city were destroyed by the floods of [[Hurricane Diane]], and 80 lives were lost. The NYO&amp;W Railroad, which depended heavily on its Scranton branch for freight traffic, was abandoned in 1957.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

The [[Knox Mine Disaster]] of January 1959 erased the mining industry in Northeastern Pennsylvania. The event eliminated thousands of jobs as the waters of the [[Susquehanna River]] flooded the mines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=10845647&amp;BRD=2259&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=460522&amp;rfi=8 |title=The Citizens Voice – Knox mine disaster remains in our memory because it is a story of right and wrong |publisher=Zwire.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msha.gov/District/Dist_01/Reports/Knox/cover.htm |title=cover |publisher=Msha.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DL&amp;W Railroad, nearly bankrupt by the drop in coal traffic and the effects of Hurricane Diane, merged with the Erie Railroad in 1960. Scranton had been the hub of its operations until the [[Erie Lackawanna]] merger, when it was no longer needed in this capacity; it was another severe blow to the labor market. Mine [[subsidence]] was a spreading problem in the city as pillar supports in abandoned mines began to fail; cave-ins sometimes consumed entire blocks of homes. The area was then scarred by abandoned coal mining structures, strip mines, and massive [[culm dump]]s. During the 1960s and 1970s, the silk and other textile industries shrunk as jobs moved south or overseas.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

There were some small bright spots during the era. In 1962, businessman [[Alex Grass]] opened his first &quot;Thrif D Discount Center&quot; drugstore on Lackawanna Avenue in downtown Scranton.&lt;ref name=hpn2&gt;{{cite news |first=Mary|last=Klaus|title='Beacon of generosity' |url=http://www.pennlive.com/news/patriotnews/index.ssf?/base/news/125143171523020.xml&amp;coll=1 |work=[[Harrisburg Patriot-News]]|publisher=|date=2009-08-28 |accessdate=2009-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=st&gt;{{cite news |first=David|last=Falchek|title=Scranton native and Rite Aid founder Alex Grass dies after 10-year battle with lung cancer |url=http://www.scrantontimes.com/scranton_native_and_rite_aid_founder_alex_grass_dies_after_10-year_battle_with_lung_cancer |work=[[Scranton Times]]|publisher=|date=2009-08-29 |accessdate=2009-08-31}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The {{convert|17|by|75|ft|m|0|sing=on}} store, an immediate success, was the progenitor of the [[Rite Aid]] drugstore chain.&lt;ref name=hpn2/&gt;

In 1970, the Secretary of Mines for Pennsylvania suggested that so many underground voids had been left by mining underneath Scranton that it would be &quot;more economical&quot; to abandon the city than make them safe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Facts &amp; Trivia |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |authorlink=Isaac Asimov |year=1998 |publisher=Siena |location=Bristol |isbn=0-75252-822-X |page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s and 1980s, many downtown storefronts and theaters became vacant as suburban shopping malls became the dominant venues for shopping and entertainment.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

===Stabilization and restoration (1985–2012)===
[[Image:Scranton, Pennsylvania, restored historic Electric City sign by Carol Highsmith (LOC highsm.04369).jpg|thumb|Historic Electric City sign, restored in 2008, shines again.]]
There has been an emphasis on revitalization since the mid-1980s. Local government and much of the community at large have adopted a renewed interest in the city's buildings and history. Aged and empty properties are being redesigned and marketed as tourist attractions. The [[Steamtown National Historic Site]] captures the area's once-prominent position in the railroad industry. The former DL&amp;W train station was restored as the [[Radisson Lackawanna Station Hotel]]. The [[Electric City Trolley Museum]] was created next to the DL&amp;W yards that the Steamtown NHS occupies. The [[Houdini Museum]] opened in Scranton by nationally known magician [[Dorothy Dietrich]] in 1990 and is the only museum in the world dedicated to Harry [[Houdini]]. The museum has been featured on more national television than other NE PA attractions combined. In 2003, [[Hilton Hotels &amp; Resorts]] opened the [http://www3.hilton.com/en/hotels/pennsylvania/hilton-scranton-and-conference-center-SCRCCHF/index.html Hilton Scranton Hotel &amp; Conference Center] at the corner of Adams Street &amp; Lackawanna Street in the heart of downtown Scranton. Due to the current rage of paranormal themed televisions shows a popular downtown historic Scranton Ghost Walk [http://scrantonghostwalk.com/] is now available 365 days a year. Other attractions responsible for recent popularity and favorable attention to the Scranton area include the [[Snö Mountain]] ski resort (formerly Montage Mountain), the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins, [[American Hockey League|AHL]] affiliate of the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]], the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Rail Riders (formerly the Scranton/Wilkes Barre Yankees and before that the Red Barons), AAA affiliate of the [[New York Yankees]], and their [[PNC Field]], and the [[Toyota Pavilion at Montage Mountain]] concert venue.

===Crisis (2012)===
According to ''[[The Guardian]]'', the city was close to bankruptcy in July 2012, with the wages of all municipal officials, including the mayor and fire chief, being cut to $7.25/hour.&lt;ref name=guard&gt;Paul Harris,[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jul/14/scranton-pennsylvania-bankrupt-minimum-wage &quot;Scranton, Pennsylvania: where even the mayor is on minimum wage&quot;], guardian.co.uk, July 14, 2012. Accessed July 14, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Financial consultant Gary Lewis, who lives in Scranton, was quoted as estimating that &quot;on 5 July the city had just $5,000 cash in hand.&quot;&lt;ref name=guard/&gt;

===Neighborhoods===
Scranton is broken into five major sections: West Side, South Side, the Hill Section (a.k.a. East Side), North Scranton, and Downtown. As with most cities and neighborhoods, boundaries can be ambiguous and are not always uniformly defined.

West Scranton (West Side) (shown in orange) is made up of a group of smaller neighborhoods including Hyde Park, West Mountain (everything north of Keyser Ave.), the Keyser Valley, Bellevue, and Tripp Park. North Scranton (shown in blue) contains the neighborhood of Providence.

The Upper Green Ridge area is the wealthiest of the neighborhoods, which extends into the neighboring borough of [[Dunmore, Pennsylvania|Dunmore]]. It was here and in parts of the Hill Section that the mansions built by former coal barons still stand. South Scranton (South Side) has the Flats, East Mountain (everything east of [[Interstate 81]]), and Minooka, which is a neighborhood in the southwestern part of the city.

The [[Scranton Iron Furnaces]] are remnants of the city's founding industry and of the Scranton family's Lackawanna Steel Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anthracitemuseum.org/iron%20furnaces.htm |title=Iron Furnaces |publisher=Anthracitemuseum.org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Steamtown National Historic Site]] seeks to preserve the history of railroads in the Northeast.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/stea/ |title=Steamtown National Historic Site (U.S. National Park Service) |publisher=Nps.gov |date=2006-02-21 |accessdate=2011-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Electric City Trolley Museum]] preserves and operates pieces of Pennsylvania streetcar history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ectma.org/ |title=The Electric City Trolley Museum Association|accessdate=2007-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Lackawanna Coal Mine]] tour at [[McDade Park]], conducted inside a former mine, describes the history of mining and railroads in the Scranton area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theminegame.com/ |title=Lackawanna County Coal Mine Tour |publisher=Theminegame.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former DL&amp;W Passenger Station is now the [[Radisson Lackawanna Station Hotel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radisson.com/scrantonpa|title=Radisson Lackawanna Station Hotel|accessdate=2007-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Museums in Scranton include the [[Everhart Museum]] in Nay Aug Park, which houses a collection of natural history, science and art exhibits; and the [[Houdini Museum]], which features films, exhibits, and a stage show in a unique, century-old building. [[Terence Powderly]]'s [[Terence V. Powderly House|house]], still a private dwelling, is one of the city's many historic buildings and, with Steamtown, the city's other [[National Historic Landmark]].

The city's religious history is evident in the [[Basilica of the National Shrine of St. Ann]], which draws thousands of pilgrims to its annual [[novena]], and [[St. Stanislaus]] [[Cathedral]], the seat of the [[Polish National Catholic Church]] in [[North America]]. The history of the founding of this [[Christian denomination|denomination]] is tied to [[Poles|Polish]] immigration to Scranton in the late 19th century.

Since the 1970s, Scranton has hosted ''La Festa Italiana'', a three-day [[Italy|Italian]] festival that takes place on [[Labor Day]] weekend on the courthouse square. The festival originally took place around [[Columbus Day]], but was moved because Scranton generally receives cold weather in October.

Scranton's large [[Irish people|Irish]] population is represented in the annual [[St. Patrick's Day Parade Scranton|Saint Patrick's Day Parade]], first held in 1862. Organized by the St. Patrick's Day Parade Association of Lackawanna County, it is the nation's fourth-largest in attendance and second-largest in per capita attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saintpatricksdayparade.com/scranton/index.htm |title=2008 Scranton Pennsylvania Saint Patrick's Day Parade – The Scranton, PA St. Patrick's Day Parade will be held on Saturday, March 15th, 2008 11:30 am |publisher=Saintpatricksdayparade.com |date=2010-03-13 |accessdate=2012-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Held on the Saturday before [[Saint Patrick's Day]], the parade includes more than 8,000 people, including floats, bagpipe players, high school bands and Irish groups. In 2008, attendance estimates were as high as 150,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thetimes-tribune.com/site/index.cfm?newsid=19404282&amp;BRD=2185&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=590572&amp;rfi=8 The Times-Tribune – City: Crowds up, rowdies contained at parade]{{dead link|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stpatparade.com/ |title=Scranton's Saint Patrick Parade |publisher=Stpatparade.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For recreation, there is [[Snö Mountain|Snö Mountain Ski Resort]], formerly &quot;Montage Mountain&quot;, which rivals the numerous resorts of the Poconos in popularity and offers a relatively comprehensive range of difficulty levels. The {{convert|26.2|mi|km|adj=on}} [[Steamtown Marathon]] has been held each October since 1996 and finishes in downtown Scranton. [[Nay Aug]] park is the largest of several parks in Scranton and was designed by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]], who also laid out [[Central Park]] in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]]. The city is the home of [[Electric Theatre Company]], a professional [[Actors' Equity Association|Equity]] theatre with a nine-month season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electrictheatre.org/3%20How%20&amp;%20Where/Location.html ]{{dead link|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scranton's primary concert venue is the [[Toyota Pavilion at Montage Mountain]], a partially covered amphitheater that seats 17,500. Its summer concerts have included [[James Taylor]], [[Dave Matthews Band]], and many other musical acts.

[[Scranton Cultural Center]] at the [[Masonic]] Temple is an impressive piece of architecture which houses several auditoriums and a large ballroom. It hosts the Northeast Philharmonic, Broadway Theater and other touring performances.

Cooper's Seafood House, formerly the Erie Train Station on North Washington Avenue, has been in business for more than 60 years.

Martz Trailways and [[Greyhound Lines]] provide coach bus transportation from its downtown station to New York City, Philadelphia and other points in the northeast.

Private operators such as Posten Taxi and McCarthy Flowered Cabs service the Scranton area. They are hired by telephone through central dispatch and cannot be hailed on the street as in larger cities.

===Railroads===
Rail transportation, vital to the city's historic growth, remains important today.

The [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] (Delaware and Hudson division) runs freight trains on the former [[Delaware, Lackawanna &amp; Western]] (DL&amp;W) line between Scranton and Binghamton, with frequent through trains often jointly operated with [[Norfolk Southern Railway]]. The [[Reading Blue Mountain &amp; Northern Railroad]] serves the former DL&amp;W Keyser Valley branch in the city.

The [[Delaware-Lackawanna Railroad]], as designated operator of county-owned rail lines, oversees the former Delaware and Hudson line from Scranton north to Carbondale, the former [[Delaware, Lackawanna &amp; Western|DL&amp;W]] line east to the [[Delaware Water Gap]] and the former [[Lackawanna and Wyoming Valley Railroad]] third-rail [[interurban streetcar]] line south to Montage Mountain, [[Moosic]]. These lines host the seasonal passenger trains of both the [[Steamtown National Historic Site]] and the [[Electric City Trolley Museum]] and are under the jurisdiction of the [[Pennsylvania Northeast Regional Rail Authority]].

The PNRRA was created by [[Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania|Lackawanna County]] and [[Monroe County, Pennsylvania|Monroe County]] to oversee the use of common rail freight lines in [[Northeastern Pennsylvania]], including one formerly owned by [[Conrail]] running from Scranton, through the [[the Poconos|Pocono Mountains]] towards [[New Jersey]] and the [[New York City]] market.

One of its primary objectives is to re-establish rail passenger service to [[Hoboken, New Jersey]] and thence by connection to New York.
As of 2011, regular passenger train service to Scranton is slated to be restored under a plan to extend [[New Jersey Transit]] (NJ Transit) service from Hoboken via the [[Lackawanna Cut-Off]].&lt;ref name=&quot;njt&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.njtransit.com/tm/tm_servlet.srv?hdnPageAction=Project019To|title=Lackawanna Cutoff|publisher=[[New Jersey Transit]]|date=October 2009|accessdate=2011-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;njarp_2009&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=NJ-ARP Annual Report 2008-2009|date=November 19, 2009|url=http://www.nj-arp.org/annrpt_09.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2011-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trains would pass the Lackawanna Station building and pull in at [[Scranton (NJT station)|a new Scranton station]] on Lackawanna Avenue along the northernmost track east of Bridge 60 (the railroad bridge over the [[Lackawanna River]]) and the Cliff Street underpass.&lt;ref&gt;NEW JERSEY – PENNSYLVANIA LACKAWANNA CUT-OFF

The city's primary industries include healthcare, tourism, public administration, manufacturing, both professional and semi-professional services, and home of the [[Park City Center]] shopping mall, the largest indoor retail facility in the region. Lancaster is known for its innovative adoption of advanced technology and hosts more electronic public [[CCTV]] outdoor cameras [[per capita]] than any other US city, despite controversy among residents.  Lancaster was home to [[James Buchanan]], the nation's 15th president, and to congressman and abolitionist [[Thaddeus Stevens]].

==History==
Originally called Hickory Town, the city was renamed after the English town of [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] by native John Wright. Its symbol, the red [[rose]], is from the [[House of Lancaster]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vacationsmadeeasy.com/LancasterPA/articles/AHistoryofLancasterPA.cfm History of Lancaster]&lt;/ref&gt; Lancaster was part of the 1681 Penn's Woods Charter of [[William Penn]], and was laid out by [[James Hamilton (Pennsylvania)|James Hamilton]] in 1734. It was incorporated as a borough in 1742 and incorporated as a city in 1818.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Lancaster County History | work=PHMC | url=http://www.phmc.state.pa.us/BAH/dam/counties/browse.asp?catid=36 | accessdate=August 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[American Revolution]], it was briefly the capital of the colonies on September 27, 1777, when the [[Continental Congress]] fled [[Philadelphia]], which had been captured by the British. After meeting one day, they moved still farther away, to [[York, Pennsylvania]]. On October 13, 2011, Lancaster's City Council officially recognized September 27 as Capital Day, a holiday recognizing Lancaster's time as capital of the nation. Lancaster was capital of Pennsylvania from 1799 to 1812, after which the capital was moved to  [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityoflancasterpa.com/lancastercity/cwp/browse.asp?a=3&amp;bc=0&amp;c=42722 City of Lancaster, PA]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1737, the [[Lancaster County Prison]] was built in the city, styled after [[Lancaster Castle]] in England.  The prison remains in use, and was used for public hangings until 1912.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.co.lancaster.pa.us/lcprison/cwp/view.asp?a=705&amp;q=521776 Lancaster County Prison overview]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first paved road in the United States was the former [[Philadelphia and Lancaster Turnpike]], which makes up part of the present-day [[U.S. Route 30]].  Opened in 1795, the Turnpike connected the cities of Lancaster and Philadelphia, and was designed by a Scottish engineer named [[John Loudon MacAdam]].  Lancaster residents are known to use the word ''&quot;[[macadam]]&quot;'' in lieu of pavement or asphalt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amishnews.com/towns/paradisehistory.htm Pennsylvanian use of the term, &quot;''macadam''&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;  This name is a reference to the paving process named by MacAdam.

The city of Lancaster was home to several important figures in American history.  [[Wheatland (Lancaster)|Wheatland]], the estate of [[James Buchanan]], the fifteenth President of the United States, is one of Lancaster's most popular attractions. [[Thaddeus Stevens]], considered among the most powerful members of the [[United States House of Representatives]], lived in Lancaster as an attorney. Stevens gained notoriety as a [[Radical Republicans|Radical Republican]] and for his [[abolitionism]]. The [[Fulton Opera House]] in the city was named for Lancaster native [[Robert Fulton]], a renaissance man who created the first fully functional steamboat. All of these individuals have had local schools named after them.

After the American Revolution, the city of Lancaster became an iron-foundry center. Two of the most common products needed by pioneers to settle the Frontier were manufactured in Lancaster:  the [[Conestoga wagon]] and the [[Long rifle|Pennsylvania long rifle]]. The Conestoga wagon was named after the [[Conestoga River]], which runs through the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/328979/Lancaster Encyclopædia Britannica's page on Lancaster, PA]&lt;/ref&gt;  The innovative gunsmith [[William Henry]] lived in Lancaster and was a U.S. congressman and leader during and after the American Revolution.
In 1803, [[Meriwether Lewis]] visited Lancaster to be educated in survey methods by the well-known surveyor [[Andrew Ellicott]]. During his visit, Lewis learned to plot latitude and longitude as part of his overall training needed to lead the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/archive/jeff/LewisClark2/Timelines/1803/1803Timeline.htm Lewis and Clark Expo timeline]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1879, [[Franklin Winfield Woolworth]] opened his first successful &quot;[[Variety store|five and dime]]&quot; store in the city of Lancaster. The [[F. W. Woolworth Company]] is succeeded by [[Foot Locker]].&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica.com&quot;/&gt;

Lancaster was one of the winning communities for the [[All-America City]] award in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncl.org/aac/past_winners/past_winners.html ]{{dead link|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
[[File:North Duke Street Lancaster.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Lancaster streetscape.]]  Lancaster City has been in the process of recreating itself recently,{{when|date=November 2013}} and there has been a growth of specialty shops, boutiques, bars, clubs, and reinvestment in downtown institutions and locations. In 2005 the creation of &quot;Gallery Row&quot; solidified the status of Lancaster as an arts destination. The art community continues to thrive and expand.
There are also plans to convert an area of unused polluted industrial grounds (i.e., [[brownfield land|brownfields]]), which were once occupied by Armstrong World Industries, into playing fields for [[Franklin &amp; Marshall College]]. This action is expected to take up most of the former industrial site. The [[Northwest Corridor (Lancaster)|Northwest Corridor]] will be developed with funds from Lancaster General Hospital. The hospital plans to create a mixed-use development which will add several city blocks to Lancaster’s grid.

Another brownfield site is Burle Business Park, the City's only commercial and industrial park. Devoted to adaptive re-use, this facility originally opened in 1942 as a U.S. Navy electronics research, development and manufacturing plant that was operated by RCA.  The Navy facility was purchased after World War II by RCA. Burle Business Park was originally occupied by Burle Industries, the successor company to the RCA New Products Division following the 1986 acquisition of RCA by [[General Electric Company]] (GE).  The GE acquisition of RCA resulted in the divestiture of this facility and the electronic business, but GE retained certain environmental liabilities that were subdivided into a separate parcel.  Burle Industries is a major manufacturer of vacuum tube products, including photomultiplier tubes, power tubes, and imaging tubes. and is the largest U.S. manufacturer of photomultiplier tubes.  Burle Industries has completed a voluntary clean-up under the Pennsylvania Land Recycling Program (&quot;Act 2&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;PADEP, appendices of Act 2 annual reports&lt;/ref&gt;

Federally, Lancaster is part of [[Pennsylvania's 16th congressional district]], represented by Republican [[Joe Pitts]], elected in 1996.

==Security Camera Controversy==
Not long after a police officer was wounded in a February 17, 2000 daytime shootout near the center of Lancaster's Penn Square, community residents, law enforcement, and elected officials sought viable solutions to rising crime in downtown.  Addressing issues of public safety was a goal when the Lancaster County Crime Commission convened in August 2000.  Public meetings and discussions were held over a two-year period.  Among the seventeen recommendations in the Crime Commission's 2003 report was to explore the feasibility of a civilian-driven system of security cameras to support law enforcement and first responders.

Lancaster's citizens did not want to have a government- or police-operated system of cameras.  The Lancaster Community Safety Coalition (LCSC) organized and was registered with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as a nonprofit in 2004. Its goals included operating a video surveillance system, but it also developed to work on safety by design and community mobilization.&lt;ref name=lancol1&gt;[http://articles.lancasteronline.com/local/4/241024 &quot;Lancaster's candid cameras: Who funds them and what the controversial videos show&quot;], ''&lt;/ref&gt; Paid LCSC staff are background-checked by the [[FBI]] and trained to monitor the network of 164 closed-circuit TV cameras in the city of Lancaster. The community organization is also interested in stimulating economic development in downtown by creating a safe environment.

In 2009, the LCSC's expansion from a 70 to a 165-camera network attracted national attention, including a front page article in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'': &quot;Lancaster, Pa., keeps a close eye on itself&quot;.&lt;ref name=lat622/&gt;&lt;ref name=lancol2&gt;[http://articles.lancasteronline.com/local/4/239161 &quot;Keeping watch on the city's cameras&quot;], ''Lancaster Online''&lt;/ref&gt; The article quoted city police chief Keith Sadler as saying, &quot;Years ago, there's no way we could do this...It brings to mind [[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]], [[George Orwell]] and ''[[Nineteen Eighty-four|1984]].'' It's just funny how Americans have softened on these issues.&quot;&lt;ref name=lat622/&gt;

Prior to the ''Los Angeles Times'' article, there had been little public opposition to the CCTV camera system. Data showed it had contributed to the prosecution or prevention of several crimes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lancastercsc.org/About/2009_Results.html &quot;Results of CCTV&quot;], ''Lancaster Online'', 2009&lt;/ref&gt; But, in response to the national coverage, a small but vocal group of opponents developed, who wanted to turn off the cameras, &quot;possibly for good.&quot;&lt;ref name=lancol1/&gt; The [[MSNBC]] commentator [[Keith Olbermann]] highlighted the issue in his '[[Worst Person in the World]]' segment, criticizing the citizens for &quot;spying on each other.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;lancol2&quot;/&gt; ABC's ''[[Nightline (US news program)|Nightline]]'' and ''[[CBS Evening News]]'' also covered the citizen-operated surveillance system.&lt;ref name=lancol1/&gt;

'''Nanticoke''' is a city in [[Luzerne County, Pennsylvania]], [[United States]]. The population was 10,465 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].

==History==
The name Nanticoke was derived from Nantego, the Indian tidewater people who moved here when their Maryland lands were spoiled for hunting by the colonial settlement in 1608.

Nanticoke was incorporated as a village in 1830; Nanticoke was chartered by the Pennsylvania Legislature as a borough on January 31, 1874.

Nanticoke experienced its greatest increase in population between 1917 and 1925 and qualified to become a Third Class City. The citizens voted in the fall of 1924 to form a city government, and elections were held the following year. The new city government consisted of a Mayor and four Councilmen who took office in January 1926, which was the official date of becoming a Third Class City.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.luzernecounty.org/living/municipalities/city_of_nanticoke&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Samuel H. Kress]] opened his first store, which grew into the national [[S. H. Kress &amp; Co.]] chain, in Nanticoke.

The [[Concrete City]], built by the [[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad|Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad's]] coal division in 1911 to house its workers, is located near the Hanover section of Nanticoke. Abandoned since 1924, it was designated an historic site in 1998, and its remains still stand as a tourist attraction. The original road that used to run to the structures has been bulldozed, though it still remains on maps. There is an alternate entrance route that does not appear on maps. It can be found at the end of Bliss &amp; Mosier St's - Hanover section of Nanticoke

Kosciuszko Street in Nanticoke is famous for being the only road in the United States to have located on it institutions covering all educational levels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gnasd.com/kmsmith.htm K.M. Smith] on Robert St. in [[Sheatown, Pennsylvania|Sheatown]] is the home for grades K-1.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The Nanticoke Elementary/Middle/High Schools and the [[Luzerne County Community College]] are all located on Kosciuszko Street.

Nanticoke city officials voted unanimously to apply to the state for [[Financially Distressed Municipalities Act|Act 47]], or economically distressed city status, which was granted in 2006. Nanticoke faced a projected $700,000 deficit that year, with revenues flat and falling far behind expenses.

'''Lower Burrell''' is a city in [[Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania|Westmoreland County]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Pennsylvania]]. Located approximately 18 miles northeast of Downtown [[Pittsburgh]], it is part of the [[Pittsburgh Metro Area]]. The population was 11,761 at the 2010 census.

== History ==
In 1852, Burrell Township was carved out of [[Allegheny Township, Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania|Allegheny Township]] in [[Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania|Westmoreland County]] due to an increase in population in the area, by Judge Jeremiah Murry Burrell. In 1879 Burrell Township was divided into two separate townships, Lower Burrell and [[Upper Burrell]]. The present-day cities of [[New Kensington]] and [[Arnold, Pennsylvania|Arnold]] were once part of Lower Burrell Township. In the years that followed, Lower Burrell transformed from a quiet, rural farm community to a residential and commercial area while Upper Burrell stayed primarily rural. In 1959, in the midst of the growth of their community, township residents voted to make Lower Burrell a third class city in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Lower Burrell continued to grow substantially until the 1980s. Like many small towns in Western Pennsylvania, Lower Burrell suffered economic and population stagnation with the collapse of local heavy industry. Since the early 1990s, Lower Burrell experienced slight growth, though one of its only large shopping centers remains mostly vacant. Preliminary data from the 2010 census shows that Lower Burrell has lost about 5 percent of its population since 2000.

The [[Allegheny River Lock and Dam No. 4]] was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;nris&quot;&gt;{{NRISref|version=2010a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
Lower Burrell is located at {{coord|40|35|2|N|79|43|19|W|type:city}} (40.583966, -79.721948).{{GR|1}}

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|11.8|sqmi|km2}}, of which, {{convert|11.6|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and {{convert|0.3|sqmi|km2}} of it (2.28%) is water.

Informally, the city is divided into different neighborhoods and areas including Bon Air, Braeburn, Braeburn Heights, Central City, Edgecliff, Gladeview, Indian Fields I &amp; II and Kinloch. Lower Burrell's central Business District overlaps Bon Air-Central City-Gladeview neighborhoods.

Lower Burrell is located in the Appalachian Plateau, the western portion of the Appalachian Mountain range. The landscape varies greatly, with large swaths of flat land (typically in Bon Air, Central City and Gladeview) to areas with gentle slopes, and even steep cliffs and hillsides in certain areas. The city is bounded on the north and southwestern corner by the [[Allegheny River]]. [[Jacks Island (Pennsylvania)|Jacks Island]], a river island approximately {{convert|0.96|km|mi|abbr=on}} in length, is located near the Braeburn neighborhood.

'''Erie''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɪər|i}} is a city located in [[Northwest Region (Pennsylvania)|northwestern]] [[Pennsylvania]] in the [[United States]]. Named for the [[Lake Erie|lake]] and the [[Erie tribe|Native American tribe]] that resided along its southern shore, Erie is the state's fourth-largest city (after [[Philadelphia]], [[Pittsburgh]] and [[Allentown, Pennsylvania|Allentown]]), with a population of 102,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;county facts&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Erie County Government|url=http://www.eriecountygov.org/default.aspx?id=rec&amp;HeadlineID=394298488593750&amp;Action=ShowArticle|title=Interesting Facts about Erie County|accessdate=2007-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Erie's Metropolitan Area consists of approximately 280,000 residents and an Urbanized Area population of approximately 195,000. The city is the [[county seat|seat of government]] for [[Erie County, Pennsylvania|Erie County]].  Erie is the principal city of the [[Erie, PA Metropolitan Statistical Area]].

Erie is near [[Buffalo, New York]], [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]],  and [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]]. Once teeming with heavy industry, Erie's manufacturing sector remains prominent in the local economy, though service industries, healthcare, higher education, and tourism are emerging as greater economic drivers. Millions visit Erie for recreation at [[Presque Isle State Park]], as well as attractions like [[Presque Isle Downs|casino and horse racetrack]] named for the state park.

Erie is known as the ''Flagship City'' because of its status as the home port of [[Oliver Hazard Perry]]'s flagship [[USS Niagara (1813)|''Niagara'']].&lt;ref name=&quot;city facts&quot;&gt;{{cite web |publisher=The City of Erie |year=2010 |url=http://www.erie.pa.us/AboutErie/Facts/tabid/80/Default.aspx|title=About Erie |accessdate=February 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city has also been called the ''Gem City'' because of the &quot;sparkling&quot; lake.&lt;ref name=&quot;city facts&quot;/&gt; Erie won the [[All-America City Award]] in 1972.

==History==
{{Main|History of Erie, Pennsylvania}}
The six nations of the [[Iroquois|Iroquois Confederacy]], which included the [[Seneca nation|Senecas]], originally occupied the lands in what is now Erie. Europeans first arrived in the region when the French constructed [[Fort Presque Isle]] near present-day Erie in 1753, as part of their effort to defend [[New France]] against the encroaching British. The name of the fort refers to that piece of land that juts into Lake Erie, now called [[Presque Isle State Park]], with the French word &quot;[[presque-isle]]&quot; meaning peninsula (literally &quot;almost an island&quot;). When the fort was abandoned by the French in 1760, it was their last post west of [[Niagara River|Niagara]]. The British occupied the fort at Presque Isle that same year, three years before the end of the [[French and Indian War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;warner-beers 503&quot;&gt;''History of Erie County'', p. 503.&lt;/ref&gt;

Present-day Erie is situated in what was the disputed [[Erie Triangle]], a triangle of land that was claimed by the states of [[New York]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Connecticut]] (as part of its [[Connecticut Western Reserve|Western Reserve]]), and [[Massachusetts]]. It officially became part of Pennsylvania on March 3, 1792, after Connecticut, Massachusetts and New York relinquished their claims to the federal government, which in turn sold the land to Pennsylvania for 75&amp;nbsp;cents per acre or a total of [[United States dollar|$]]151,640.25 in [[Continental (currency)|Continental currency]]. The Iroquois released the land to Pennsylvania in January 1789 for payments of $2,000 from Pennsylvania and $1,200 from the federal government. The [[Seneca Nation]] separately settled land claims against Pennsylvania in February 1791 for the sum of $800.&lt;ref name=&quot;nelson 103-104&quot;&gt;Nelson, pp. 103−104.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Battle erie.jpg|thumb|left|The Battle of Lake Erie played a role in the history of Erie.]]

The General Assembly of Pennsylvania commissioned the surveying of land near Presque Isle through an act passed on April 18, 1795. [[Andrew Ellicott]], who completed [[Pierre Charles L'Enfant]]'s survey of [[Washington, D.C.]] and helped resolve the boundary between Pennsylvania and New York, arrived to begin the survey and lay out the plan for the city in June 1795. Initial settlement of the area began that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;nelson 103-104&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;warner-beers 505-506&quot;&gt;''History of Erie County'', pp 505−506.&lt;/ref&gt; Lt.  [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Seth Reed]] and his family moved to the Erie area from [[Geneva, New York]], and before that from [[Uxbridge, Massachusetts]], and became the first European settlers of Erie, settling at what became known as &quot;Presque Isle&quot;.

To wrest control of the [[Great Lakes]] from the British during the [[War of 1812]], President [[James Madison]] ordered the construction of a naval fleet at Erie. Noted shipbuilders [[Daniel Dobbins]] of Erie and Noah Brown of New York led construction of four schooner−rigged gunboats and two brigs. Commodore [[Oliver Hazard Perry]] arrived from [[Rhode Island]] and led the squadron to success in the historic [[Battle of Lake Erie]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;History of Erie County&quot;, pp. 299, 306.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Erie, Pennsylvania 1922.jpg|thumb|right|State and 9th Streets in downtown Erie during the early 1920s]]

Erie was an important shipbuilding, fishing, and railroad hub in the mid-19th century. The city was the site where three sets of [[track gauge]]s met. While the delays required to unload and load passengers and cargo were a problem for commerce and travel, they provided much needed local jobs in Erie. When a national [[standard gauge|standardized gauge]] was proposed, those jobs, and the importance of the rail hub itself, were put in jeopardy. The citizens of Erie, led by the mayor, set fire to bridges, ripped up track and rioted to attempt to stop the standardization in an event known as the [[Erie Gauge War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Rhodes |first=James Ford |authorlink=James Ford Rhodes |title=History of the United States from the compromise of 1850 |year=1900 |publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers |location=New York, New York |url=http://www.archive.org/details/historyunitedst20rhodgoog |volume=3 |page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 3, 1915, the [[Mill Creek (Lake Erie)|Mill Creek]] flooded downtown Erie when a [[culvert]], blocked by debris, gave out.&lt;ref name=&quot;flood&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Erie's Blackest Day &amp; Other Accounts of Phenomenal Weather |date=October 2008 |publisher=Erie County Historical Society |format=PDF |url=http://www.eriecountyhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/eriesblackestday3.pdf |accessdate=August 29, 2010 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A four block reservoir, caused by torrential downpours, had formed behind it. The resulting deluge destroyed 225&amp;nbsp;houses and killed 36&amp;nbsp;people.&lt;ref name=&quot;flood&quot;/&gt; After the flood, Mayor [[Miles Brown Kitts|Miles B. Kitts]] had the Mill Creek diverted to a {{Convert|22|x|19|ft}}, concrete tube that travels for over {{Convert|2|mi}} under the city, before emptying into to [[Presque Isle Bay]] on the city's lower east side.

Erie's importance gradually faded during the second half of 20th Century as the age of lake trade, commercial fishing, and American manufacturing dominance drew to a close.&lt;ref name=&quot;mary&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=City-data.com|url=http://www.city-data.com/us-cities/The-Northeast/Erie-History.html|title=Erie Detailed History|accessdate=2007-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Downtown Erie continued to grow for most of the 20th century, before taking a major population downturn in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=&quot;mary&quot;/&gt; With the advent of the automobile age, thousands of residents left Erie for suburbs such as [[Millcreek Township, Erie County, Pennsylvania|Millcreek Township]], which now has over 50,000 people.&lt;ref name=&quot;mary&quot;/&gt;

Erie has won the [[All-America City Award]] only once, in 1972, and was a finalist in 1961, 1994, 1995 and 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Frederick |first=Robb |title=Erie falls in award contest |newspaper=Erie Times-News |date=June 20, 2009 |url=http://www.goerie.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090620/NEWS02/306199871 |accessdate=November 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Past Winners of the All-America City Award |publisher=[[National Civic League]] |year=2011 |accessdate=February 3, 2011 |url=http://www.allamericacityaward.com/past-winners-of-the-all-america-city-award}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
[[File:Erie Zoo train bridge.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The [[Mill Creek (Lake Erie)|Mill Creek]] passes through the middle of the [[Erie Zoo]].]]

Erie is situated at {{Coord|42|6|52|N|80|4|34|W|type:city}} (42.114507, -80.076213),{{GR|1}} directly between [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[New York]], and [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]] on the south-central shores of Lake Erie. Erie's bedrock is [[Devonian]] [[shale]] and [[siltstone]], overlain by glacial [[till]]s and [[Outwash plain|stratified drift]]. Stream drainage in Erie flows northward into [[Lake Erie]], then through [[Lake Ontario]], the [[Saint Lawrence River|St. Lawrence River]], and out to the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. South of Erie is a drainage divide, where most of the streams south of this divide in western Pennsylvania flow in a southward direction into the [[Allegheny River|Allegheny]] or [[Ohio River|Ohio]] rivers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Glacial Geology of Northwestern Pennsylvania&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/topogeo/pub/generalgeology/G32/G32.aspx |title=General Geology Report 32 |accessdate=2007-11-02 |publisher=Pennsylvania Geological Survey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|28.0|sqmi}} with {{convert|22.0|sqmi}} being land and the remaining (21.54%) being water. Erie is home to [[Presque Isle State Park]] (known to the locals as &quot;The Peninsula&quot;), a [[peninsula]] that juts into [[Lake Erie]] and has {{convert|7|mi}} of public beaches, wetlands, and fishing sites.

[[File:Erie, Pennsylvania map.png|thumb|left|A road map of Erie showing the major routes that travel through it.]]

Erie is laid out in a grid surrounding [[Perry Square]] in the downtown area.&lt;ref name=&quot;map&quot;&gt;{{Cite map |title=City of Erie, Erie County |publisher=Pennsylvania Department of Transportation |date=September 23, 2008 |format=PDF |series=Type 5C |url=ftp://ftp.dot.state.pa.us/public/pdf/BPR_pdf_files/Maps/City/Erie/25302.pdf |accessdate=February 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The downtown buildings are separated from the waterfront by the Bayfront Parkway.&lt;ref name=&quot;map&quot;/&gt; The tallest structure in Erie is [[St. Peter Cathedral, Erie|St. Peter Cathedral]] at {{convert|265|ft|m|0}} and the tallest building is [[Renaissance Centre (Erie, Pennsylvania)|Renaissance Centre]] at {{convert|198|ft|m|0}} tall. Erie has generally small ethnic neighborhoods including Little Italy. South of 38th Street, the grid gives way to curvilinear roads of post-1970 suburban development. [[Millcreek Township, Erie County, Pennsylvania|Millcreek Township]] and upper [[Peach Street]] in Summit Township include the Erie metropolitan area's newer developments.

Most of the cityscape includes renovated and refurbished factory buildings, mid−rise housing, single family homes, and office buildings. Erie's waterfront includes the [[List of city parks of Erie, Pennsylvania|Burger King Amphitheater]] and surrounding parkland, which hosts numerous festivals. The [[Bayfront Convention Center]] is on Sassafras Pier next to Dobbins Landing. The [[Bicentennial Tower]] is centrally located in the skyline when viewed from Presque Isle State Park, with the high-rise and mid-rise buildings flanking the higher ground behind and to the east and west sides. On the east end of the waterfront, the [[Erie Maritime Museum]] and the city's main library, and third largest in Pennsylvania, host the [[USS Niagara (1813)|''Niagara'']]. Docks and [[marina]]s fill the freshwater shoreline in between.

===Climate===
The climate of Erie is typical of the Great Lakes. Erie is located in the [[snow belt]] that stretches from [[Cleveland]] to [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]] and [[Watertown (city), New York|Watertown]]; accordingly, its winters are typically cold, with heavy [[lake effect snow]], but also with occasional stretches of mild weather that cause accumulated snow to melt. Erie lies on the typical [[Humid continental climate|humid continental]] zone ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Dfa'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Kottek |first=Marcus |last2=Greiser |first2=Jürgen |last3=Beck |first3=Christoph |last4=Rudolf |first4=Bruno |last5=Rubel |first5=Franz |display-authors=2 |title=World Map of Köppen−Geiger Climate Classification |date=June 2006 |journal=Meteorologische Zeitschrift |volume=15 |issue=3 |page=261 |doi=10.1127/0941-2948/2006/0130}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city experiences a full range of weather events, including snow, ice, rain, thunderstorms and fog. The city's lakeside location helps to temper summer heat, with an average of only 3.8 days of {{convert|90|°F|0}}+ highs annually, and the highest temperature ever recorded was {{convert|100|°F|0}} on June 25, 1988; there is an average of 2.5 days with sub-{{convert|0|°F|0}} lows annually, and the lowest temperature ever recorded was {{convert|−18|°F|0}} on January 19, 1994.)&lt;ref name = NOAA/&gt;

In the early 20th century, Erie had a significant Russian immigrant community, many of whom worked in the [[shipbuilding]] plants along the bayfront. Unusual for a Great Lakes city, a substantial number of these Russian immigrants were Priestless ([[Old Believers#Bespopovtsy|Bespopovtsy]]) [[Old Believer]]s.  In 1983, most of this community united with the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia, and became [[Edinoverie|Priested Old Ritualists]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.churchofthenativity.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=147&amp;Itemid=57 Church of the Nativity: Our Parish, retrieved 6-23-2008]&lt;/ref&gt; Even today, the gold-domed Church of the Nativity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.churchofthenativity.net|title=Church of the Nativity|accessdate=2007-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the bayfront near the former heart of the Russian community, is an Old Ritualist church, home to famed [[Icon]] painter Fr.

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Erie, Pennsylvania}}
[[File:Eriefactory01.jpg|thumb|right|Old Erie Forge &amp; Steel factory in Erie at 16th and Greengarden Streets.]]
Erie is the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania's primary access point to [[Lake Erie]], the Great Lakes, and the [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]]. The city emerged as a maritime center after the [[American Revolution]], then as a railroad hub during the great American westward expansion. Erie became an important city for iron and steel manufacturing during the [[Industrial Revolution]] and thrived well into the 20th century with big industry.

While only [[diesel-electric locomotive]] building remains from the ranks of the large manufacturers in the early 21st century, a more diverse mix of mid-sized industries has emerged. This broader economic base includes not only smaller and more agile steel and plastic plants, but also a vigorous service sector: health, insurance and tourism. {{As of|December 2010}}, Erie's unemployment rate was 8.9&amp;nbsp;percent, as compared to rates for Pennsylvania and the United States at 8.5 and 9.4&amp;nbsp;percent, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Jim |last=Martin |date=February 1, 2011 |newspaper=Erie Times-News |url=http://www.goerie.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2011302019972 |title=Erie County's unemployment rate dips below 9 percent |accessdate=February 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Erie is the corporate headquarters of the [[Erie Insurance Group]], and [[Marquette Savings Bank]]. [[Lord Corporation]] was founded and has major operations in Erie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=McNeel | first=Rick | url=http://www.lord.com/our-company/history.xml | publisher=Lord Corporation | title=Lord History | accessdate=2007-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with GE and Erie Insurance, major employers in the county, and consequently, the city include the County, [[Government of Pennsylvania|State]] and [[Federal government of the United States|Federal]] governments, as well as the [[Erie City School District]].&lt;ref name=&quot;employers&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Erie County, Top 50 Employers |date=September 24, 2010 |format=PDF |publisher=[[Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry]] |location=[[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]] |url=http://www.paworkstats.state.pa.us/admin/gsipub/htmlarea/uploads/erie_t50.pdf |accessdate=February 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shoppers from Ohio, New York, and the Canadian province of Ontario frequent the [[Millcreek Mall]] and [[Peach Street]] stores and attractions as a result of Pennsylvania's [[tax exemption]] on clothing.

Both [[Hamot Medical Center]] and [[Saint Vincent Health System]] are also major employers in Erie.&lt;ref name=&quot;employers&quot;/&gt; On February 1, 2011, Hamot merged with the [[University of Pittsburgh Medical Center]] and became UPMC Hamot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Bruce |first=David |title=Erie hospital is now now officially UPMC Hamot |date=February 2, 2011 |newspaper=Erie Times-News |url=http://www.goerie.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2011302019912 |accessdate=February 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]] operates the [[Erie Veterans Affairs Medical Center]] on East 38th Street.

==Utilities==
The [[Erie Water Works]], which was incorporated in 1865 as the Erie Water and Gas Company, includes a reservoir, two water treatment plants, and an elaborate water works and pipe network that provides water for most of the city and suburbs. Penelec, a subsidiary of [[FirstEnergy]], supplies electricity to the region, as well as the [[Touchstone Energy|Northwestern Pennsylvania Rural Electric Cooperative]]. [[Time Warner Cable]] became the region's [[cable television]] provider, after taking over [[Adelphia Communications Corporation|Adelphia]], and also provides digital phone and high-speed internet to the region.  Local telephone and high speed internet service is also provided by [[Verizon]].

Sewage service in Erie is provided by the Erie Sewer Authority, and many outlying townships have partnerships with the Sewer Authority for service. The Authority cleans about 30−{{convert|40|e6USgal|m3}} of wastewater every day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=The City of Erie|url=http://www.ci.erie.pa.us/Departments/SewerDepartment/tabid/74/Default.aspx|title=Erie Sewer Department|accessdate=May 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''New Castle''' is a city in [[Lawrence County, Pennsylvania|Lawrence County]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[United States]], {{convert|50|mi|km}} northwest of [[Pittsburgh]] and near the Pennsylvania-Ohio border just {{convert|18|mi|km}} east of [[Youngstown, Ohio]]; in 1910, the total population was 36,280; in 1920, 44,938; and in 1940, 47,638. The population has fallen to 23,128 according to the [[United States Census 2010|2010 census]]. It is the [[county seat]] of [[Lawrence County, Pennsylvania|Lawrence County]].{{GR|6}} New Castle is the principal city of the New Castle [[United States micropolitan area|micropolitan area]] and a part of the [[Pittsburgh metropolitan area|Pittsburgh–New Castle]] [[Combined Statistical Area]], which is the 18th largest in the [[United States]]. It is the commercial center of a fertile agricultural region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lawrence County Historical Society - History of New Castle |work=http://www.lawrencechs.com/new_castle.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:City Rescue Mission - Front.jpg|thumb|City Rescue Mission located between Croton Avenue and [[Neshannock Creek]]]]
In 1798, John Carlysle Stewart, a civil engineer, traveled to western Pennsylvania to resurvey the &quot;donation lands&quot; resurveyed lands, which had been reserved for veterans of the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]]. He discovered that the original survey had neglected to stake out approximately {{convert|50|acre|m2}} at the confluence of the [[Shenango River]] and the [[Neshannock Creek]], at that time a part of [[Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Allegheny County]]. Claiming the land for himself, he laid out what was to become the town of New Castle. Stewart laid out the town of New Castle in April 1798. It comprised approximately {{convert|50|acre|m2}}, in what was then part of Allegheny County. New Castle became a borough in 1825, having a population of about 300. The city later became a part of Mercer County. On April 5, 1849, the Governor of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania signed an act creating Lawrence County named in honor of U.S. Navy Captain [[James Lawrence]]. New Castle became a city in 1869 and was headed by its first Mayor, Thomas B. Morgan. At that time, the population had increased to about 6,000.

In 1849, a group of [[Old Order Amish]] families from [[Mifflin County, Pennsylvania]], settled just north of New Castle in [[New Wilmington]]. Later migrations from [[Holmes County, Ohio]] would make this Amish community one of the largest in Pennsylvania. Approximately 2,000 Amish live and work presently in the townships north of New Castle.

Business in New Castle began to flourish in the early 19th century with the construction of the canal system, which made its way through the city. Numerous manufacturing plants became located in New Castle because of the availability of transportation facilities and ready access to raw material markets. The canal system was later supplemented and then replaced by railroads which offered greater speed and capacity for freight, as well as year round service.

In the 1870s, the city became a major hub of the [[Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad]]. New Castle's population swelled from 11,600 in 1890 to 28,339 in 1900, and to 38,280 in 1910, as immigrants flocked to the city to work in the mills and nearby limestone quarries, particularly from Italy.&lt;ref name=&quot;WAT&quot;&gt;Watkins, John, ''The Big Stunts of Great Detectives: The Scrapbook'', Vol. 4, No. 6, New York: Frank A. Munsey (December 1907), p. 1098.&lt;/ref&gt; Italian laborers of the era were frequent victims of the [[Black Hand (extortion)|Black Hand]] society, which employed blackmail and extortion to rob the workers of their pay. In 1907 the headquarters of the ''Black Hand'' for the entire region was discovered in the village of Hillsville a few miles west of New Castle.&lt;ref name=&quot;WAT&quot;/&gt; By this time New Castle was one of the fastest growing cities in the country, and with the construction of the largest tin plate mill in America, the city became the tin plate capital of the world. The tin plate industry marked a new increase the city's prosperity.

In 1908 New Castle was linked to Pittsburgh by the [[Pittsburgh, Harmony, Butler and New Castle Railway]], an [[interurban]] trolley line. Steel and paper mills, foundries, a bronze bushing factory, and car-construction plants contributed to the economy. In addition, the Shenango China produced commercial china and created fine china for the White House, including dinnerware for Presidents [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]. Other ceramic factories produced bathroom fixtures and industrial refractory materials.

In the 1920s, New Castle enjoyed its greatest prosperity. The landscape of the city was transformed with the building of many beautiful structures, some of which still stand, such as The Cathedral, St. Mary's Church, and the Castleton Hotel. The city also established its identity. New Castle is known both as the &quot;hot dog capital of the world&quot; and the &quot;fireworks capital of America.&quot; Its chili dogs are the product of Greek immigrants who came to New Castle in the early 20th century and established restaurants along with their homes. The notoriety for fireworks is credited to two local fireworks companies of international stature, S.Vitale Pyrotechnic Industries, Inc. (Pyrotecnico) and Zambelli Internationale.

In the 1930s the city, along with most cities of America, suffered during the [[Great Depression]]. During this trying time, the federal government established the [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA) and the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] (CCC). These programs offered jobs to many displaced workers. Many of the stone walls built by the WPA and the CCC still stand as a reminder of the historic demise of the economy.

Industry temporarily surged during wartime. In 1950, the population peaked at 48,834, but became part of the [[rust belt]], with population dwindling to 28,334 by 1990. New Castle is the County Seat of Lawrence County which has a population of approximately 100,000.

In 1998, the City of New Castle was a host city for the History Channel Great Race. Over 15,000 spectators gathered downtown for the festivities. The city also celebrated its 200th birthday in 1998 with a downtown fireworks festival that attracted over 30,000 people.

The first fireworks manufacturer in New Castle was Leopold Fazzoni, who owned and operated the Fazzoni Brothers Fireworks Company. Mr. Fazzoni came to New Castle from Italy in 1886 and worked in the tin mills to earn enough money to start his own business. Mr. Fazzoni was issued the first certificate for fireworks manufacturing in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Of the people who worked with the Fazzoni family, many founded their own businesses, such as: Paul Rozzi, Jacob Conti, Constantino Vitale, and Joseph Zambelli.

Despite recent economic challenges, the city continues to serve as the headquarters of [[Pyrotecnico]] Fireworks, the winner of the 2008 Gold Jupiter, awarded at the world’s most prestigious fireworks venue: LaRonde in Montreal, Canada. Started by Constantino Vitale in Italy in 1889, Constantino immigrated to New Castle continuing his business there in the 1920s. Five generations of the Vitale family have transformed the company.In the 1990s the company's name was changed to Pyrotecnico and has grown to be a world leader in the industry. Also located in New Castle is [[Zambelli Fireworks]], which was founded in New Castle. [[Zambelli Fireworks]] is one of the world's leading [[fireworks]] and [[pyrotechnics]] companies. These fireworks companies have been featured in venues such as presidential celebrations and Super Bowls. Pyrotecnico and Zambelli Fireworks have changed the face of the fireworks industry. This has gained the city the nickname, &quot;Fireworks Capital of America.&quot; New Castle has recently opened Zambelli Plaza near the [[Cascade Center]] in 2007 in honor of the Zambelli family's accomplishments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Santangelo|first=Denice M.|title=George R.

==Economy==
[[File:PierIComplex.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The Pier I Complex Building in downtown New Castle]]
Downtown New Castle is currently undergoing a redevelopment centered around the [[Cascade Center]]. The downtown streets and sidewalks were rebuilt in the early 21st century to resemble the style at the start of the 19th century. The revitalization of downtown also saw two major routes into the city, [[Pennsylvania Route 65]] and [[U.S. Route 224]], which have both had their terminus extended into downtown since the start of 2007.

[[InfoCision Management Corporation|InfoCision]], a [[telemarketing]] services company, restored the former New Castle Dry Goods Co. building, where it moved its offices into from the Cascade Galleria. The building had been vacant since the late 1980s when the Troutman's [[department store]] closed and became registered on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. The building is now known as the Pier I Complex Building.

The downtown area has also become the home of several [[bank]] offices, hosting the regional headquarters of [[Huntington Bancshares|Huntington]], [[FirstMerit Corp.|FirstMerit]], and [[First Commonwealth Bank|First Commonwealth]] (all descended from banks formerly based in the city but later acquired) as well as branches for [[PNC Financial Services|PNC Bank]] and [[FNB Corporation|First National Bank]]. [[Mellon Financial Corporation|Mellon Bank]] also had offices across the street from the current Zambelli Plaza before selling off its New Castle-area branches to First National Bank, which closed the office building since it already had the aforementioned branch in downtown. Mellon's former [[parking lot]] was restored and is now the parking lot for the Cascade Center and other downtown businesses.

==Education==

===Public schools===
The city itself is served by the [[New Castle Area School District]], with several areas also served by their respective [[school district]]s. New Castle Area also serves nearby [[West Pittsburg, Pennsylvania|West Pittsburg]]. The [http://www.lcvt.tec.pa.us/lcvt/site/default.asp Lawrence County Career and Technical Center] is also located in the city. There are three primary centers at New Castle: John F. Kennedy, West Side and Thaddeus Stevens. There is a kindergarten (Lockly) and a pre-kindergarten (Croton). The middle school is George Washington Intermediate.

===Private schools===
New Castle and all of Lawrence County is served by the New Castle Christian Academy (NCCA) On Albert Street in between Sumner Avenue and Clen-Moore Boulevard In the North Hill Historic District. NCCA serves students from Pre-K to 8th grade.

===Post-secondary education===
New Castle proper is primarily served by four [[Tertiary education|post-secondary education]] facilities: the [[New Castle Beauty School]] for [[cosmetology]] students in downtown, the [[New Castle School of Trades]] for technical trades in [[Pulaski Township, Lawrence County, Pennsylvania|Pulaski Township]], the [[Jameson School of Nursing]] (owned &amp; operated by [[Jameson Health System]]) within the city, and the Lawrence County branch of [[Butler County Community College (Pennsylvania)|Butler County Community College]], which opened in 2008 in Union Township and serves as a primary [[community college]] to Lawrence County.

Among more traditional four-year [[University|universities]] within short driving distance includes [[Geneva College]] in [[Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania|Beaver Falls]], [[Grove City College]] in [[Grove City, Pennsylvania|Grove City]], [[Slippery Rock University of Pennsylvania|Slippery Rock University]] in [[Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania|Slippery Rock]], [[Westminster College, Pennsylvania|Westminster College]] in [[New Wilmington, Pennsylvania|New Wilmington]], and [[Youngstown State University]] in Youngstown just outside of [[Downtown Youngstown|downtown]]. [[Pennsylvania State University|Penn State]] also has two branches within driving distance: the [[Penn State Beaver|Beaver campus]] in [[Monaca, Pennsylvania|Monaca]] and the [[Penn State Shenango|Shenango campus]] in [[Sharon, Pennsylvania|Sharon]].

==Transportation==
New Castle has [[public transportation]] in the form of the [[New Castle Transit Authority]], which provides [[bus]] service to patrons around the city and makes three daily trips to Pittsburgh.

Among local routes, [[Interstate 376]], [[Pennsylvania Route 18]], and [[U.S. Route 422]] are the major routes running through the city, while two more major routes — [[Pennsylvania Route 65]] and [[U.S. Route 224]] — both terminate in the city. [[Pennsylvania Route 108]] and [[Pennsylvania Route 168]] also run through the city. U.S. 422 Business, a former alignment of U.S. 422, runs through the city, ending on each side of the city when the main 422 leaves the New Castle Bypass. I-376 and U.S. 422 are briefly [[Concurrency (road)|concurrent]] with each other on the New Castle Bypass, though south of New Castle until [[Chippewa Township, Pennsylvania|Chippewa Township]] near [[Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania|Beaver Falls]], I-376 is [[toll road|tolled]] by the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission]]. The area is located a short drive from [[Interstate 79]], [[Interstate 80 in Pennsylvania|Interstate 80]], and [[Interstate 76 (east)|Interstate 76]]/[[Pennsylvania Turnpike]].

The closest [[airport]] is the New Castle Municipal Airport which is a purely municipal airport with no commercial service. Most residents of New Castle use [[Pittsburgh International Airport]] which is about {{convert|42|mi|km}} from downtown. Also, [[Youngstown-Warren Regional Airport]], [[Akron-Canton Airport]], and [[Cleveland Hopkins International Airport]] are all within driving distance of the city center.

==Media==
===Newspaper===
The local community is served by the ''[[New Castle News]]'', a [[newspaper]] published in the [[afternoon]] Monday-Friday. On the weekends, the paper publishes the ''New Castle News Weekend'', published on Saturday mornings. The ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'', ''[[Pittsburgh Tribune-Review]]'', and ''[[The Vindicator]]'' also have large distributions in the area.

===Television===
The area is served by both the Pittsburgh and Youngstown television stations, with regular news coverage in the area from both. Despite being considerably closer to Youngstown, New Castle is part of the Pittsburgh [[designated market area|DMA]] by [[Nielsen Media Research]]. It is, however, part of the Youngstown radio market according to [[Arbitron]] ratings, even though most Pittsburgh-area radio stations can easily be heard within the area.

New Castle was home to the first [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television affiliate in [[Western Pennsylvania]] when [[WKST-TV]] signed on in 1953, as [[WTAE-TV]] in Pittsburgh did not sign on until 1958 and [[WJET-TV]] did not sign on in [[Erie, Pennsylvania|Erie]] until 1966. The station moved its license to Youngstown in 1964, moved to channel 33, and changed its call sign to [[WYTV]]. WYTV remains an ABC affiliate today, while the channel 45 allocation is now used by [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] member station [[WNEO]] in [[Alliance, Ohio]]. Currently, the only TV station in New Castle is [[WPCP-CD]] 27, a [[Low-power broadcasting|low-powered]] satellite station of Pittsburgh low-powered [[Independent station (North America)|independent station]] [[WBGN-CD]]. [[WPXI]] did recently apply to the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] for a repeater station on channel 33 in the city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fcc.gov/fcc-bin/tvq?list=0&amp;facid=73910 TV Query Results - Video Division (FCC) USA]. Fcc.gov. Retrieved on 2013-07-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radio===
New Castle is home to two [[AM radio|AM]] stations: [[talk radio|talk]] station [[WKST (AM)|WKST]] 1200 and [[sports talk]] station [[WJST]] AM 1280, the latter being a [[Fox Sports Radio]] affiliate. For [[FM radio|FM]], [[WPKL|WKPL]] FM 92.1, an [[oldies]] station, was licensed in New Castle before its license was moved to [[Ellwood City, Pennsylvania|Ellwood City]] in 2004, though it still includes New Castle as one of its local communities as part of its [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]]-mandated [[station identification]]. The AM stations are owned by [[Altoona, Pennsylvania|Altoona]]-based Forever Broadcasting, LLC while WKPL is owned by [[Froggy (brand)|Froggy]] parent Keymarket Communications of Pittsburgh.

==Culture==
[[Image:Zambelli Plaza.jpg|thumb|left|Zambelli Plaza at night]]The city was the site of an important development in the history of [[Warner Bros.]] studios, given that the first Warner Bros. theater, the Cascade, opened there in 1907. (The Warners, most of whom were [[Poles|Polish]] [[Jewish]] immigrants, resided in Youngstown.) The theater was restored and reopened in 2006. The building was nearly condemned ten years earlier after a wall fell on the sidewalk near East Washington Street (one of the city's main thoroughfares) before its historical significance was discovered, saving the building. Municipal officials have planned [[Adaptive reuse|recent revitalization efforts]] around the former theater, which is now known as [[Cascade Center]]. The facility currently features two restaurants and a local stage theater, and plans are in progress to turn the complex into New Castle's version of [[Station Square]] in [[Pittsburgh]]. This revitalization plan, however, will focus on motion pictures rather than railroads.

The Cascade Center itself is named after Cascade Park, located on the outskirts of the city's East Side in [[Shenango Township, Lawrence County, Pennsylvania|Shenango Township]] along [[Pennsylvania Route 65]]. A former [[trolley park]], it was restored and converted into a regular outdoor park in the 1980s with a few historical buildings as well as the park's entrance sign restored, avoiding the fate of nearby [[Idora Park, Youngstown|Idora Park]] in Youngstown. The park hosts the annual ''Back to the 50s Weekend'' classic car show, and previously hosted the similarly themed ''Thunder in the Cascades'' motorcycle show until concerns about nudity and alcohol use at the event as opposed to the more family-friendly ''Back to the 50's Weekend'' had the event moved to the Lawrence County Fairgrounds in nearby [[Hickory Township, Lawrence County, Pennsylvania|Hickory Township]] in the early 21st century.

The New Castle Playhouse, a community theatre, is located along Long Avenue and puts on several shows a year, and is one of the only such theatres between Youngstown and theatre-rich Pittsburgh.

[[The Old Princeton School]], located nearby, has been the venue for rock concerts. 

New Castle is also a short drive from [[McConnells Mill State Park]] in [[Slippery Rock Township, Lawrence County, Pennsylvania|Slippery Rock Township]] and neighboring [[Moraine State Park]] in [[Muddy Creek Township, Pennsylvania|Muddy Creek Township]] in [[Butler County, Pennsylvania|Butler County]].

In the 2011 movie, ''Super 8'', New Castle, Pennsylvania is referenced as the &quot;fireworks capital of the world.&quot;{{citation needed|date=July 2011}}

New Castle has a large Arab-American population whose culture is visible throughout the community. Large numbers of Lebanese and Syrian immigrants were attracted by the city's prosperity in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Their culture is especially visible in the local cuisine, which makes popular use of items such as stuffed grape leaves, lamb on the rod, kibbe, and garlic sauce. Although many other Rust Belt cities contain large Arab-American populations, New Castle is unique for its large population of Alawite Muslims from Syria. The Muslim community of the city has a mosque on the East Side of town.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Syrian Community in New Castle and Its Unique Alawi Component, 1900-1940&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Toth |first1=Anthony |year=1986 |title=The Syrian Community in New Castle and Its Unique Alawi Component, 1900-1940 |journal=Western Pennsylvania History |volume=69 |issue=3 |pages=221–240 |publisher= |doi= |url=http://dpubs.libraries.psu.edu/DPubS?service=Repository&amp;version=1.0&amp;verb=Disseminate&amp;view=body&amp;content-type=pdf_1&amp;handle=psu.wph/1206472370# | accessdate=January 12, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Reading''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|ɛ|d|ɪ|ŋ}} {{Respell|RED|ing}}) is a city in southeastern [[Pennsylvania]], United States, and the seat of [[Berks County, Pennsylvania|Berks County]].{{GR|6}} It is the principal city of the [[Greater Reading Area]]. Reading had a population of 88,082 as of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], making it the fifth most populated city in the state &amp;ndash; after [[Philadelphia]], [[Pittsburgh]], [[Allentown, Pennsylvania|Allentown]] and [[Erie, Pennsylvania|Erie]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Scr1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012-3.html|title=Annual Estimates of the Resident Population for Incorporated Places: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012|accessdate=2013-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; and the fifth most-populous [[municipality]].&lt;ref name=ReadingEagle&gt;{{cite web|url=http://readingeagle.com/article.aspx?id=293371|title=Census Shows Reading, Berks growth spurt|accessdate=2011-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], Reading has the highest share of citizens living in poverty in the nation.&lt;ref name=NYTimesCensus&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/27/us/reading-pa-tops-list-poverty-list-census-shows.html?_r=1&amp;amp;pagewanted=all|title=Reading, PA tops poverty list, census shows|accessdate=2012-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city lent its name to the now-defunct [[Reading Railroad]], which transported anthracite coal from the Pennsylvania [[Coal Region]] to the eastern United States via the [[Port of Philadelphia]]. Reading Railroad is one of the four railroad properties in the classic United States version of the [[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]] board game. 

Reading was one of the first localities where outlet shopping became a tourist industry. It has been known as &quot;The Pretzel City&quot; because of numerous local [[pretzel]] bakeries. Currently, Bachman, Dieffenbach, and Unique Pretzel bakeries call the Reading area home.

==History==
[[File:Reading Pennsylvania.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Downtown Reading, with Berks County courthouse on the left.]]
[[File:Reading, Pennsylvania and its suburbs 1955.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Reading and its suburbs, 1955.]]
[[Lenape|Lenni Lenape]] people, also known as &quot;Delaware Indians&quot;, were the original inhabitants of the Reading area.

The Colony of Pennsylvania was a 1680 land grant from King [[Charles II of England]] to [[William Penn]]. Comprising more than 45,000 square miles (120,000 km2), it was named for his father, [[Sir William Penn]].

In 1743, Richard and Thomas Penn (sons of William Penn) mapped out the town of Reading with [[Conrad Weiser]]. Taking its name from [[Reading, Berkshire]], England, the town was established in 1748. Upon the creation of Berks County in 1752, Reading became the county seat. The region was settled by emigrants from southern and western [[Germany]] who bought land from the Penns. The first Amish community in the [[New World]] was established in Greater Reading, Berks County.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.readingberkspa.com/content.asp?page=funfacts |title=content.aspGreater Reading's destination hub : Greater Reading Convention and Visitors Bureau |publisher=Readingberkspa.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pennsylvanian German dialect was spoken in the area well into the 1950s and later.

During the [[French and Indian War]], Reading was a military base for a chain of forts along the [[Blue Mountain (Pennsylvania)|Blue Mountain]]. 

By the time of the [[American Revolution]], the area's [[iron]] industry had a total production which exceeded England's. That output that would help supply [[George Washington]]'s troops with cannons, rifles, and ammunition in the Revolutionary War. During the early period of the conflict, Reading was again a depot for military supply. [[Hessian (soldiers)|Hessian]] prisoners from the [[Battle of Trenton]] were also detained here.

[[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] was the capital of the United States at the time of the [[Yellow Fever Epidemic of 1793]].&lt;ref&gt;Washington, D.C. became the national capital in 1800.&lt;/ref&gt; President Washington traveled to Reading, and considered making it the emergency national capital, but chose [[Germantown, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Germantown]] instead.

[[Susanna Cox]] was tried and convicted for infanticide in Reading in 1809.  Her case attracted tremendous sympathy; 20,000 viewers came to view her hanging, swamping the 3,000 inhabitants.  As a result of her trial, laws were changed, and she was the last woman executed in the state of Pennsylvania.

The [[Schuylkill Canal]], a north-south canal completed in 1825, paralleled the [[Schuylkill River]] and connected Reading with Philadelphia and the [[Delaware River]]. The [[Union Canal (Pennsylvania)|Union Canal]], an east-west canal completed in 1828, connected the Schuylkill and [[Susquehanna River]]s, and ran from Reading to [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]]. Railroads forced the abandonment of the canals by the 1880s. 

The [[Philadelphia and Reading Railroad]] (P&amp;R) was incorporated in 1833. During the [[Long Depression]] following the [[Panic of 1873]], a [[Great Railroad Strike of 1877|statewide railroad strike]] in 1877 over delayed wages led to a violent protest and clash with the National Guard in which six Reading men were killed.&lt;ref&gt;Zinn, Howard. ''A People's History of the United States 1492–present'' (New York: HarperPerennial, 1995), p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt; After over a century of prosperity, the Reading Company was forced to file for bankruptcy protection in 1971. The bankruptcy was a result of dwindling coal shipping revenues and strict government regulations that denied railroads the ability to set competitive prices, required high taxes, and forced the railroads to continue to operate money-losing passenger service lines. On April 1, 1976, the Reading Company sold its current railroad interests to the newly formed Consolidated Railroad Corporation ([[Conrail]]).

Early in the 20th century, the city participated in the burgeoning [[automobile]] and motorcycle industry as home to the pioneer [[Brass era|&quot;Brass Era&quot;]] companies, [[Daniels Motor Company]], [[Duryea Motor Wagon Company]] and Reading-Standard Company.&lt;ref&gt;Clymer, Floyd. ''Treasury of Early American Automobiles, 1877-1925'' (New York: Bonanza Books, 1950), p.158.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Reading experienced continuous growth until the 1930s, when its population reached nearly 120,000. From the 1940s to the 1970s, however, the city saw a sharp downturn in prosperity, largely owing to the decline of the heavy industry and railroads, on which Reading had been built, and a national trend of urban decline.

In 1972, [[Hurricane Agnes]] caused extensive flooding in the city, not the last time the lower precincts of Reading were inundated by the [[Schuylkill River]] as a similar, though not as devastating, [[Mid-Atlantic United States flood of 2006|flood]] occurred during June 2006.

The 2000 census showed that Reading's population decline had ceased. This was attributed to an influx of [[Hispanic]] residents from [[New York]], as well as from the extension of [[suburban sprawl]] from [[Philadelphia]]'s northwest suburbs.

Reading has its share of obstacles to overcome, namely crime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.morganquitno.com/xcit06pop.htm#METRO City Crime Rankings by Population Group&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; However, new crime fighting strategies appear to be having an impact, as in 2006 the city dropped in the rankings of dangerous cities, and then again in 2007.

In December 2007, [[NBC]]'s ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'' show featured Reading as one of the top four &quot;Up and Coming Neighborhoods&quot; in the United States as showing potential for a real estate boom.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with [[Barbara Corcoran]] on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'' show. [http://video.msn.com/video.aspx?mkt=en-US&amp;brand=msnbc&amp;vid=71e0105d-a691-4971-95cd-e3c75fc8035f Online]. December 2007. Retrieved 27 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The interviewee [[Barbara Corcoran]] chose the city by looking for areas of big change, renovations, cleanups of parks, waterfronts, and warehouses. Corcoran also noted Reading's proximity to [[Philadelphia]], [[New York City|New York]], and [[Northeast megalopolis|other cities]]. The financial crisis of 2008 and subsequent nationwide recession stifled optimism; in November 2011 the PBS Newshour reported that Reading was officially the poorest city in the nation with 49% of inhabitants living below the poverty line.

The climate in and around Reading is variable but relatively mild.  The Reading area is considered a [[humid subtropical climate]], with areas just to the north designated as a [[humid continental climate]]. Summers are warm and humid with average July highs around 85 °F.  Extended periods of heat and high humidity do occur.  On average, there are 15–20 days per year where the temperature exceeds 90 °F.  Reading becomes more mild in the autumn as the heat and humidity of summer relent to lower humidity and temperatures.  The first killing frost generally occurs in mid to late October.

Winters bring freezing temperatures, but usually move above freezing during the day's warmest point. The average January high is 37; the average January low is 20 °F, but it is not unusual for winter temperatures to be much lower or higher than the averages. The all-time record low (not including wind chill) was −21 °F during a widespread [[1994 North American cold wave|cold wave in January 1994]]. Snow is common in some winters, but the harsher winter conditions experienced to the north and west are not typical of Greater Reading. Annual snowfall is variable, but averages around 32&amp;nbsp;inches. Spring temperatures vary widely between freezing temperatures and the 80s or even 90s later in Spring.  The last killing frost usually is in later April, but freezing temperatures have occurred in May. Total precipitation for the entire year is around 45&amp;nbsp;inches (112&amp;nbsp;cm).

==Geography==
Reading is located at {{coord|40|20|30|N|75|55|35|W|region:US_type:city}} (40.341692, -75.926301){{GR|1}} in southeastern [[Pennsylvania]], roughly {{convert|65|mi|km}} northwest of [[Philadelphia]]. According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|10.1|sqmi|km2}}.  {{convert|9.8|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and {{convert|0.2|sqmi|km2}} of it (2.39%) is water. The total area is 2.39% water. The city is largely bounded on the west by the [[Schuylkill River]], on the east by Mount Penn, and on the south by Neversink Mountain. The [[Reading Prong]], the mountain formation stretching north into [[New Jersey]], has come to be associated with naturally-occurring [[radon]] gas; however, homes in Reading are not particularly affected. The surrounding county is home to a number of family-owned farms.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

==Economy==
Companies based in Reading and surrounding communities include [[Boscov's]], [[Carpenter Technology Corporation|Carpenter]], [[Penske Truck Leasing]], and [[Redner's Markets]].

In 2012, the ''New York Times'' called Reading, &quot;the nation's poorest city.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;The Beleaguered Middle Class, New York Times, 13 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transportation==

===Bus===
[[File:Reading BARTA bus.jpg|thumb|BARTA bus in downtown Reading.]]
Public transit in Reading and its surrounding communities has been provided since 1973 by [[Berks Area Regional Transportation Authority|BARTA]], the Berks Area Regional Transportation Authority.  BARTA operates a fleet of 55 buses serving 21 routes, mostly originating at the BARTA Transportation Center in Downtown Reading. In addition, [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]] and [[Bieber Tourways|Bieber]] bus routes are available from the InterCity Bus Terminal. The former Reading Railroad Franklin Street Station was refurbished and reopen to bus service on September 9, 2013 with buses running the express route back and forth to [[Lebanon Transit]].

===Roadways===
A number of federal and state highways allow entry to and egress from Reading. [[U.S. Route 222 Business (Reading, Pennsylvania)|U.S. Route 222 Business]] is designated as Lancaster Avenue, Bingaman Street, South 4th Street, and 5th Street. [[U.S. Route 422 Business (Reading, Pennsylvania)|U.S. Route 422 Business]] is designated as Penn Street, Washington Street (westbound), Franklin Street (eastbound), and Perkiomen Avenue. [[U.S. Route 422]], the major east-west artery, circles the western edge of the city and is known locally as The West Shore Bypass. [[Pennsylvania Route 12|PA Route 12]] is known as the Warren Street Bypass, as it bypasses the city to the north. [[Pennsylvania Route 10|PA Route 10]] is known as Morgantown Road. From the 1960s to the late 1990s, the section of current U.S. Route 222 from Spring Blvd to 5th Street Highway was known locally as the 'Road to Nowhere'.

===Airlines===
Reading and the surrounding area is serviced by the [[Reading Regional Airport]], a general aviation airfield.  The three letter airport code for Reading is RDG. Scheduled commercial airline service to Reading ended in 2004, when the last airline, [[USAir]] stopped flying into Reading. The modern air terminal now sits abandoned. Reading is a short drive from [[Harrisburg International Airport]], [[Lehigh Valley International Airport]], and [[Philadelphia International Airport]].

===Rail===
Passenger trains ran between Pottsville, Reading, Pottstown and Philadelphia until July 27, 1981, when transit operator [[SEPTA]] curtailed commuter service to electrified lines. Since then, there have been repeated calls for the resumption of the services.

In the late 1990s and up to 2003, SEPTA, in cooperation with Reading-based [[BARTA]] funded a study called the [[Schuylkill Valley Metro]] which included plans to extend both sides of SEPTA's [[Manayunk/Norristown Line|R6 passenger line]] to [[Pottstown, Pennsylvania|Pottstown]], Reading, and [[Wyomissing]], Pennsylvania. The project suffered a major setback when it was rejected by the [[Federal Transit Administration]] New Starts program, which cited doubts about the ridership projections and financing assumptions used by the study. With the recent surge in gasoline prices and ever-increasing traffic, the planning commissions of [[Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Montgomery County]] and [[Berks County]] have teamed to study the feasibility of a simple diesel shuttle train between the [[Norristown/Manayunk Line]] and Pottstown/Reading.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.r6extension.com r6extension.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
[[File:Reading Art Museum.jpg|thumb|[[Reading Public Museum]] in 2011.]]
The city's cultural institutions include the Reading Symphony Orchestra and its education project the [[Reading Symphony Youth Orchestra]], the [[GoggleWorks]] Art Gallery, the [[Reading Public Museum]] and the [[Historical Society of Berks County]].

Reading is the birthplace of graphic artist [[Jim Steranko]], poet [[Wallace Stevens]], Guitar Virtuoso [[Richie Kotzen]] and [[George Baer Hiester]].  Marching Band Composer and writer [[John Philip Sousa]], the March King, died in Reading's Abraham Lincoln Hotel in 1932.  [[Keith Haring]],&lt;ref name=&quot;np&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |title= Keith Haring's pop art celebrated in today's Google Doodle |periodical=[[National Post]] |date=May 4, 2012 |url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/05/04/keith-haring-google-doodle/ |accessdate=May 4, 2012 |postscript= &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; NFL quarterbacks [[Chad Henne]], [[Kerry Collins]], wide receiver [[Steve Kreider]] and singer [[Taylor Swift]] are not from the City of Reading, but surrounding towns in [[Berks County, Pennsylvania|Berks County]].

Reading is home to the 14 time world champion drum and bugle corps, the [[Reading Buccaneers Drum and Bugle Corps|Reading Buccaneers]].

In 1914, one the anchors of the Battleship [[USS Maine (ACR-1)|Maine]] was delivered from the [[Washington Navy Yard]] to City Park, off of Perkiomen Avenue. The anchor was dedicated during a ceremony presided over by [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], who was then assistant secretary of the navy.

Reading was home to several movie and theater palaces in the early 20th Century. The Astor, Embassy, Loew's Colonial, and Rajah Shrine Theater were grand monuments of architecture and entertainment. Today, after depression, recession, and urban renewal, the Rajah is the only to remain. The Astor Theater was demolished in 1998 to make way for The [[Sovereign Center]]. Certain steps were taken to retain mementos of the Astor; Including its ornate [[Art Deco]] chandelier and gates. These are on display and in use inside the arena corridors, allowing insight into the ambiance of the former movie house. In 2000, the Rajah was purchased from the [[Shriners]]. After a much needed restoration, it was renamed the [[Sovereign Performing Arts Center]].

The [[Mid-Atlantic Air Museum]] is a membership-supported museum and restoration facility located at [[Carl A. Spaatz]] Field. The museum actively displays and restores historic and rare war aircraft and civilian airliners. Most notable to their collection is a [[Northrop P-61 Black Widow]] under active restoration since its recovery from Mount Cyclops, New Guinea in 1989. Beginning in 1990, the museum has hosted &quot;World War II Weekend Air Show&quot;, scheduled to coincide with [[June 6, 1944|D-Day]]. On display are period wartime aircraft (many of which fly throughout the show) vehicles, and weapons.

The mechanical ice cream scoop was invented in Reading by William Clewell in 1878. The 5th Ave Bar and York Peppermint Patty were invented in Reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.readingberkspa.com/content.asp?page=funfacts |title=content.aspGreater Reading's destination hub : Greater Reading Convention and Visitors Bureau |publisher=Readingberkspa.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Attractions==
[[File:Pagoda Reading PA USA.jpg|thumb|Reading's [[Pagoda (Reading, Pennsylvania)|Pagoda]] seen from Skyline Drive.]]
In 1908, a Japanese-style [[pagoda]] was built on Mount Penn, where it overlooks the city and is visible from almost everywhere in town.  Locally, it is referred to as the &quot;[[Pagoda (Reading, Pennsylvania)|The Pagoda]]&quot;.  It is currently the home of a cafè and a gift shop. It remains a popular tourist attraction.

Another fixture to Reading's skyline is the William Penn Memorial Fire Tower; one mile from the Pagoda on Skyline Drive. Built in 1939 for fire department and forestry observation, the tower is 120 feet tall, and 950 feet elevation above the intersection of fifth and Penn Streets. From the top of the tower is a 60 mile panoramic view.

The Reading Glove and Mitten Manufacturing Company founded in 1899, just outside Reading city limits, in West Reading and Wyomissing boroughs changed its name to Vanity Fair in 1911 and is now the major clothing manufacturer [[VF Corp.]]  In the early 1970s, the original factories were developed to create the [[VF Corp.#VF Outlet Village|VF Outlet Village]], the first outlet mall in the United States. The mall is so successful that it draws hundreds of thousands of tourists to Reading every year.

==In media==
The book and movie ''[[Rabbit, Run]]'' and the other three novels of the ''Rabbit'' series by [[John Updike]] were set in fictionalized versions of Reading and nearby [[Shillington, Pennsylvania|Shillington]], called [[Brewer, Pennsylvania|Brewer]] and [[Olinger, Pennsylvania|Olinger]] respectively. Updike was born in Reading and lived in nearby Shillington until he was thirteen.

Filmmakers Gary Adelstein, Costa Mantis, and Jerry Orr's created ''Reading 1974: Portrait of a City'', relying heavily on montage, is a cultural time capsule.

'''Bradford''' is a small [[city]] located in rural [[McKean County, Pennsylvania]], in the United States {{convert|78|mi}} south of Buffalo, New York.

==History==
Settled in 1823, Bradford was chartered as a city in 1879 and emerged as a wild oil boomtown in the [[Pennsylvania oil rush]] in the late 19th century. The area's Pennsylvania Grade crude oil has superior qualities and is free of asphaltic constituents, contains only trace amounts of sulfur and nitrogen, and has excellent characteristics for refining into lubricants.  World-famous Kendall racing oils were produced in Bradford.

The population peaked at 19,306 in 1930, but at the 2010 census had dropped to 8,770. Two adjoining townships, home to approximately 9,000 people, make the population of Greater Bradford about 18,000. Famous Bradfordians include the opera singer [[Marilyn Horne]], the Hall of Fame baseball player [[Rube Waddell]] and the five-time All-Star football player [[Stew Barber]]. A famous [[perpetual motion]] machine hoax was created in Bradford in 1897 by J.M. Aldrich; it was exposed in the July 1, 1899, issue of the ''[[Scientific American]]'' magazine, leading to a four-month prison sentence in the county jail.

The [[Bradford Armory]], [[Bradford Downtown Historic District]], [[Bradford Old City Hall]], and [[Rufus Barrett Stone House]] are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nris&quot;&gt;{{NRISref|version=2010a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economy ==

Bradford is the home of [[Zippo]], a manufacturer of collectible pocket lighters, and [[W. R. Case &amp; Sons Cutlery Co.|Case]], which is owned by Zippo and makes collectible knives. In February 2009, the two companies employed 1,117 people, but significant layoffs have taken place since then. After Zippo and Case, the second largest employer is Bradford Regional Medical Center (BRMC), which employed 759 in February 2009. BRMC underwent a significant campus expansion in 2006. Other major employers in February 2009 included Beacon Light (682 employees), Bradford Area School District (474) and Wal-Mart (378). The nearby Federal Prison employed 301 at that time.

The city is home to American Refining Group (formerly Kendall), and their line of Brad Penn oil products. Along with being Bradford's longest running active business, ARG is the oldest continuously operating refinery in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.penngrade1.com|title=Brad Penn Oil}}&lt;/ref&gt; It celebrated its 125th anniversary in 2006. Since ARG purchased the refinery in the mid-1990s, employment has almost doubled, to just under 300 in February 2009.

Bradford has a growing four-year college, the [[University of Pittsburgh at Bradford]] (Pitt-Bradford), which in the fall term 2009 had 1,455 full-time students and 202 part-time students for a total enrollment of 1,657, with 217 full-time employees and 106 part-time employees. Almost 900 students live on campus. The university's campus has grown significantly in recent years. Current building projects include a new residence hall, a chapel and laboratory upgrades to the science building.

==Arts and entertainment==
The Bradford Creative and Performing Arts Center season runs from September to March. The Bromeley Family Theater at The University of Pittsburgh at Bradford hosts many events in the University's Spectrum Series that brings authors, artists, musicians, recitalists and performance groups to campus with all events open to the public. Theater productions are staged by the theater departments at Pitt-Bradford and the high school and by the Bradford Little Theater, which celebrated its 10th anniversary in 2006. An annual community talent show, Kiwanis Kapers, occurs in the fall.

Annual festivals include Stinkfest (a festival promoting [[leek]] cuisine),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.stinkfest.org/ | title = Stinkfest | accessdate = 2009-06-05 | publisher = East Bradford Business Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; Summer Daze (formerly  known as Summerfest), Autumn Daze, the Italian Festival, the Zippo/Case International Swap Meet (biennial, with Zippo Days held in off years) and the Crook Farm Country Fair. Bradford celebrates New Year's Eve with a First Night celebration. In early August, the annual Big 30 Charity high school all star football game takes place at Parkway Field, where a million-dollar artificial playing surface was installed in 2008. In 2009, for the first time, National Night Out was a significant event in Bradford, coinciding with Taste of Bradford.

==Geography==
Bradford is located on Route 219 just south of its junction with I-86 above the New York State border.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|3.5|sqmi}}, all of it land. Bradford is situated in a valley in the Allegheny Mountains and is surrounded by woods and steep hills. Two branches of the [[Tunungwant Creek]] enter the city, merge and flow north into the [[Allegheny River]] just across the New York border.

[[Bradford Regional Airport]] is located about {{convert|15|mi|km}} south of the city, at Mount Alton. Because of its elevation, 1,443 feet (440 meters) above sea level, the airport often has the coldest reported air temperatures in Pennsylvania. The airport has one of the few National Weather Service stations across the entire northern tier of the state. Temperatures in the city are typically three to seven degrees warmer than at the airport, and actual city temperatures are more representative of other communities in northern Pennsylvania and southwestern New York than are the airport's.

==Climate==
Bradford has a [[humid continental climate]] with long, snowy winters and warm, humid summers. The record low in Bradford is {{Convert|-37|F|C|0}} set in February 1934 and the record high is {{Convert|98|F|C|0}} in July 1936 and again in July 1986. Other notable extremes include a {{Convert|-9|F|C|0}} recording on November 29, 1930, and on November 30, 1929, a {{Convert|-3|F|C|0}} recording on April 1, 1923, an {{Convert|83|F|C|0}} degree reading on March 30, 1986 and March 29, 1998, and a {{Convert|28|F|C|0}} degree reading on August 29, 1982. Late fall/early winter is especially snowy due to heavy amounts of lake effect snow from [[Lake Erie]] and, to a lesser extent, [[Lake Ontario]]. Lake effect snow during cold snaps in early spring also helps to raise snowfall totals.

In 1682, [[William Penn]] founded the city to serve as capital of [[Province of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania Colony]].

Philadelphia was one of the nation's [[List of capitals in the United States|capitals]] during the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], and the city served as the temporary U.S. capital while [[Washington, D.C.]], was under construction. During the 19th century, Philadelphia became a major industrial center and railroad hub that grew from an influx of European immigrants. It became a prime destination for African Americans during the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] and surpassed two million occupants by 1950.

The city is the center of economic activity in [[Pennsylvania]], and is home to the [[Philadelphia Stock Exchange]] and several [[Fortune 500]] companies.

Philadelphia is known for its arts and culture.

{{Main|History of Philadelphia}}
{{seealso|Timeline of Philadelphia history}}
[[File:Treaty of Penn with Indians by Benjamin West.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Penn's Treaty with the Indians]]'' by [[Benjamin West]]]]
Before Europeans arrived, the Philadelphia area was home to the [[Lenape|Lenape (Delaware)]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]]s in the village of [[Shackamaxon]].
Europeans came to the [[Delaware Valley]] in the early 17th century, with the first settlements founded by the Dutch, who in 1623 built [[Fort Nassau (South River)|Fort Nassau]] on the [[Delaware River]] opposite the [[Schuylkill River]] in what is now [[Brooklawn, New Jersey]]. The Dutch considered the entire Delaware River valley to be part of their [[New Netherland]] colony. In 1638, Swedish settlers led by renegade Dutch established the colony of [[New Sweden]] at [[Fort Christina]] (present day Wilmington, Delaware) and quickly spread out in the valley. In 1644, [[New Sweden]] supported the [[Susquehannocks]] in their military defeat of the English colony of Maryland. In 1648, the Dutch built [[Fort Beversreede]] on the west bank of the Delaware, south of the Schuylkill near the present-day [[Eastwick, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Eastwick]] section of Philadelphia, to reassert their dominion over the area. The Swedes responded by building [[Fort Nya Korsholm]], named New Korsholm after a town that is now in Finland. In 1655, a Dutch military campaign led by New Netherland Director-General [[Peter Stuyvesant]] took control of the Swedish colony, ending its claim to independence, although the Swedish and Finnish settlers continued to have their own militia, religion, and court, and to enjoy substantial autonomy under the Dutch. The English conquered the New Netherland colony in 1664, but the situation did not really change until 1682, when the area was included in [[William Penn]]'s charter for Pennsylvania.

In 1681, in partial repayment of a debt, [[Charles II of England]] granted [[William Penn]] a [[charter]] for what would become the [[Province of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania colony]]. Despite the royal charter, Penn bought the land from the local Lenape to be on good terms with the Native Americans and ensure peace for his colony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

As a [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]], Penn had experienced religious persecution and wanted his colony to be a place where anyone could worship freely. This tolerance, far more than afforded by most other colonies, led to better relations with the local Native tribes and fostered Philadelphia's rapid growth into America's most important city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Penn planned a city on the Delaware River to serve as a port and place for government. Hoping that Philadelphia would become more like an English rural town instead of a city, Penn laid out roads on a [[grid plan]] to keep houses and businesses spread far apart, with areas for gardens and orchards. The city's inhabitants did not follow Penn's plans, as they crowded by the Delaware River, the port, and subdivided and resold their lots.&lt;ref&gt;''Philadelphia: A 300-Year History'', pages 7, 14 – 16&lt;/ref&gt; Before Penn left Philadelphia for the last time, he issued the Charter of 1701 establishing it as a city. It became an important trading center, poor at first, but with tolerable living conditions by the 1750s. [[Benjamin Franklin]], a leading citizen, helped improve city services and founded new ones, such as fire protection, a library, and one of the American colonies' first hospitals.

[[File:Benjamin Franklin by Jean-Baptiste Greuze.jpg|thumb|right|100px|[[Benjamin Franklin]], 1777]]
A number of important philosophical societies were formed, which were centers of the city's intellectual life: the Philadelphia Society for Promoting Agriculture (1785), the Pennsylvania Society for the Encouragement of Manufactures and the Useful Arts (1787), the [[Academy of Natural Sciences]] (1812), and the [[Franklin Institute]] (1824).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://explorepahistory.com/story.php?storyId=35&amp;chapter=2 |title=Explore PA History website |publisher=Explorepahistory.com |accessdate=December 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; These worked to develop and finance new industries and attract skilled and knowledgeable immigrants from Europe.

Philadelphia's importance and central location in the colonies made it a natural center for [[American Revolution|America's revolutionaries]]. The city hosted the [[First Continental Congress]] before the war; the [[Second Continental Congress]], which signed the [[United States Declaration of Independence]], during the war; and the [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]] (1787) after the war. [[Philadelphia campaign|Several battles]] were fought in and near Philadelphia as well.

The state government left Philadelphia in 1799, and the federal government was moved to Washington, DC in 1800 with completion of the White House and Capitol.  The city remained the young nation's largest with a population of nearly 50,000 at the turn of the 19th century; it was a financial and cultural center. Before 1800, its free black community founded the [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]] (AME), the first independent black denomination in the country, and the first black Episcopal Church. The free black community also established many schools for its children, with the help of Quakers.  New York City soon surpassed Philadelphia in population, but with the construction of roads, [[canal]]s, and railroads, Philadelphia became the first major industrial city in the United States.

Throughout the 19th century, Philadelphia had a variety of industries and businesses, the largest being textiles. Major corporations in the 19th and early 20th centuries included the [[Baldwin Locomotive Works]], [[William Cramp and Sons|William Cramp and Sons Ship and Engine Building Company]], and the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]].&lt;ref&gt;''Philadelphia: A 300-Year History'', pages 214, 218, 428 – 429&lt;/ref&gt; Industry, along with the [[United States Centennial|U.S. Centennial]], was celebrated in 1876 with the [[Centennial Exposition]], the first official [[World's fair|World's Fair]] in the United States. Immigrants, mostly Irish and German, settled in Philadelphia and the surrounding districts. The rise in population of the surrounding districts helped lead to the [[Act of Consolidation, 1854|Act of Consolidation of 1854]], which extended the city limits of Philadelphia from the 2 square miles of present-day [[Center City (Philadelphia)|Center City]] to the roughly 130 square miles of [[Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia County]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The city was a destination for thousands of Irish immigrants fleeing the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] in the 1840s; housing for them was developed south of South Street, and was later occupied by succeeding immigrants. They established a network of Catholic churches and schools, and dominated the Catholic clergy for decades. Anti-Irish, anti-Catholic [[Philadelphia Nativist Riots|Nativist riots]] had erupted in Philadelphia in 1844. In the latter half of the century, immigrants from Russia, Eastern Europe and Italy; and African Americans from the [[Southern United States|southern U.S.]] settled in the city.&lt;ref&gt;''Insight Guides: Philadelphia and Surroundings'', pages 38–39&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1880 and 1930, the African-American population of Philadelphia increased from 31,699 to 219,559.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/wphila/stats/census_lloyd.html Notes on the historical development of population in West Philadelphia]&quot;, University of Pennsylvania.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://bentley.umich.edu/research/publications/migration/ch1.php Detroit and the Great Migration, 1916–1929 by Elizabeth Anne Martin]&quot;.

[[File:Phila8thMarket.jpg|thumb|left|8th and Market Street, showing the [[Strawbridge and Clothier]] department store, 1910s]]
By the 20th century, Philadelphia had become known as &quot;corrupt and contented&quot;, with a complacent population and an entrenched [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[political machine]].&lt;ref&gt;''Philadelphia: A 300-Year History'', pages 535, 537&lt;/ref&gt; The first major reform came in 1917 when outrage over the election-year murder of a police officer led to the shrinking of the [[Philadelphia City Council]] from two houses to just one.&lt;ref&gt;''Philadelphia: A 300-Year History'', pages 563 – 564&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1919, Philadelphia was one of more than 36 industrial cities nationally to suffer a race riot of ethnic whites against blacks during [[Red Summer]], in post-World War I unrest, as recent immigrants competed with blacks for jobs. In the 1920s, the public flouting of [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] laws, [[Mafia|mob]] violence, and police involvement in illegal activities led to the appointment of [[Brigadier General]] [[Smedley Butler]] of the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]] as director of public safety, but political pressure prevented any long-term success in fighting crime and corruption.&lt;ref&gt;''Philadelphia: A 300-Year History'', pages 578 – 581&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940, non-Hispanic whites constituted 86.8% of the city's population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Race and Hispanic Origin for Selected Cities and Other Places: Earliest Census to 1990|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|url=http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The population peaked at more than two million residents in 1950, then began to decline with the restructuring of industry, which led to the loss of many middle-class union jobs. In addition, suburbanization had been drawing off many of the wealthier residents to outlying railroad commuting towns and newer housing. Revitalization and [[gentrification]] of neighborhoods began in the late 1970s and continues into the 21st century, with much of the development in the [[Center City, Philadelphia|Center City]] and [[University City, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|University City]] areas of the city. After many of the old manufacturers and businesses left Philadelphia or shut down, the city started attracting service businesses and began to more aggressively market itself as a tourist destination. Glass-and-granite skyscrapers were built in Center City. Historic areas such as [[Independence National Historical Park]] located in Old City and Society Hill were renovated during the reformist mayoral era of the 1950s through the 1980s.  They are now among the most desirable living areas of Center City. This has slowed the city's 40-year population decline after it lost nearly one-quarter of its population.&lt;ref&gt;''Insight Guides: Philadelphia and Surroundings'', pages 44–45&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''A Concise History of Philadelphia'', page 78&lt;/ref&gt; The city has attracted more recent immigrants: Hispanics from Central and South America and Asian refugees from Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia.  Educated Asians from India have tended to settle in suburbs with other middle- and upper-class people.

===Architecture===
{{Main|Architecture of Philadelphia|List of tallest buildings in Philadelphia}}

Philadelphia's architectural history dates back to [[Colonial America|Colonial]] times and includes a wide range of styles. The earliest structures were of [[Log home|logs]] construction, but brick structures were common by 1700. During the 18th century, the [[cityscape]] was dominated by [[Georgian architecture]], including [[Independence Hall (United States)|Independence Hall]] and [[Christ Church, Philadelphia|Christ Church]].
[[File:OneLiberyPlacePhiladelphia.jpg|thumb|[[Center City Philadelphia]] showing [[One Liberty Place]] and [[Philadelphia City Hall|City Hall]]]]
In the first decades of the 19th century, [[Federal architecture]] and [[Greek Revival architecture]] were dominated by Philadelphia architects such as [[Benjamin Latrobe]], [[William Strickland (architect)|William Strickland]], [[John Haviland]], [[John Notman]], [[Thomas U. Walter]], and [[Samuel Sloan (architect)|Samuel Sloan]].&lt;ref name=Philadelphia-Page251&gt;{{Cite book|title=Philadelphia: A 300-Year History|pages=11, 41, 174–175, 251–253}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frank Furness]] is considered Philadelphia's greatest architect of the second half of the 19th century, but his contemporaries included [[John McArthur, Jr.]], [[Addison Hutton]], [[Wilson Eyre]], the [[Wilson Brothers &amp; Company|Wilson Brothers]], and [[Horace Trumbauer]]. In 1871, construction began on the [[Second Empire (architecture)|Second Empire]]-style [[Philadelphia City Hall]]. The [[Philadelphia Historical Commission]] was created in 1955 to preserve the cultural and architectural history of the city. The commission maintains the [[Philadelphia Register of Historic Places]], adding historic buildings, structures, sites, objects and districts as it sees fit.&lt;ref name=&quot;PNC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phila.gov/historical/ |title=Philadelphia Historical Commission |publisher=Phila.gov |accessdate=April 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1932, Philadelphia became home to the first [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]] skyscraper in the United States, The [[PSFS Building]], designed by [[George Howe (architect)|George Howe]] and [[William Lescaze]]. It is the United States' first modern skyscraper and considered the most important one built in the first part of the 20th century.

The {{convert|548|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} City Hall remained the tallest building in the city until 1987 when [[One Liberty Place]] was constructed. Numerous glass and granite skyscrapers were built from the late 1980s onwards. In 2007, the [[Comcast Center (office building)|Comcast Center]] surpassed One Liberty Place to become the city's tallest building and make Philadelphia one of only four American cities with two or more buildings over {{convert|900|ft|m}}; the other cities being [[New York City|New York]], [[Houston]], and [[Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of tallest buildings in the United States|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tallest_buildings_in_the_United_States|accessdate=2012-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For much of Philadelphia's history, the typical home has been the [[Terraced house|row house]]. The row house was introduced to the United States via Philadelphia in the early 19th century and, for a time, row houses built elsewhere in the United States were known as &quot;Philadelphia rows&quot;.&lt;ref name=Philadelphia-Page251/&gt; A variety of row houses are found throughout the city, from Victorian-style homes in North Philadelphia to twin row houses in West Philadelphia. While newer homes are scattered throughout the city, much of the housing is from the early 20th century or older. The great age of the homes has created numerous problems, including blight and vacant lots in many parts of the city, while other neighborhoods such as [[Society Hill, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Society Hill]], which has the largest concentration of 18th-century architecture in the United States, have been rehabilitated and gentrified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Philadelphia has more murals than any other U.S. city, thanks in part to the 1984 creation of the Department of Recreation's [[Mural Arts Program]], which seeks to beautify neighborhoods and provide an outlet for [[graffiti]] artists. The program has funded more than 2,800 [[mural]]s by professional, staff and volunteer artists and educated more than 20,000 youth in underserved  neighborhoods throughout Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Philadelphia's two major [[Newspaper|daily newspapers]] are ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' and the ''[[Philadelphia Daily News]]'', both of which are owned by Philadelphia Media Holdings L.L.C. ''The Philadelphia Inquirer'', founded in 1829, is the third-oldest surviving daily newspaper in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Wilkinson | first=Gerry | url=http://www.broadcastpioneers.com/inquirerhistory.html | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060221062916/http://www.geocities.com/phillyppa/inquirer.html | archivedate=February 21, 2006 | title=The History of the Philadelphia Inquirer | publisher=Philadelphia Press Association | accessdate=July 20, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Bulletin (newspaper)|The Bulletin]]'', another newspaper that operates in Philadelphia, traces its history back to ''[[The Philadelphia Bulletin]]'' that went defunct in 1982. ''The Bulletin'' is locally owned by The Bulletin, Inc.

The first experimental radio license was issued in Philadelphia in August 1912 to [[Saint Joseph's University|St. Joseph's College]]. The first [[commercial broadcasting]] radio stations appeared in 1922: first [[WIP-AM|WIP]], then owned by [[Gimbel's|Gimbel's department store]], on March 17, followed the same year by [[WFIL]], WOO, [[WPHT|WCAU]] and WDAS.&lt;ref name=&quot;Media&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| first=Todd | last=Bishop | year=2000 | month=January 7 | title=The Media: One revolution after another | journal=Philadelphia Business Journal|url=http://philadelphia.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/stories/2000/01/10/story3.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highest-rated stations in Philadelphia include [[soft rock]] [[WBEB]], [[KYW (AM)|KYW Newsradio]], and [[urban adult contemporary]] [[WDAS-FM]]. Philadelphia is served by three major non-commercial [[public broadcasting|public radio]] stations, [[WHYY-FM]] (NPR), [[WRTI]] (jazz, classical), and [[WXPN-FM]] (adult alternative music), as well as several smaller stations.

In the 1930s, the experimental station [[KYW-TV|W3XE]], owned by [[Philco]], became the first television station in Philadelphia; it became [[NBC]]'s first affiliate in 1939, and later became [[KYW-TV]] ([[CBS]]). [[WCAU|WCAU-TV]], [[WPVI-TV]], [[WHYY-TV]], [[WPHL-TV]], and [[WTXF-TV]] had all been founded by the 1970s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Media&quot; /&gt; In 1952, WFIL (now WPVI) premiered the television show ''Bandstand'', which later became the nationally broadcast ''[[American Bandstand]]'' hosted by [[Dick Clark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Ogden | first=Christopher | year=1999 | title=Legacy: A Biography of Moses and Walter Annenberg | publisher=Little, Brown and Company | location=New York | isbn=0-316-63379-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, as in many large metropolitan areas, each of the commercial networks has an affiliate, and call letters have been replaced by corporate IDs: CBS3, 6ABC, NBC10, Fox29, Telefutura28, Telemundo62, Univision65, plus My PHL 17 and [[WPSG-TV|CW Philly 57]]. The region is served also by [[public broadcasting]] stations [[WYBE-TV]] (Philadelphia), WHYY-TV (Wilmington, Delaware and Philadelphia), [[WLVT-TV]] (Lehigh Valley), and [[NJTV]] (New Jersey). In September 2007, Philadelphia approved a [[Public-access television]] cable TV channel.

As of 2013, Philadelphia is the only media market in the United States that has [[owned-and-operated stations]] of all five English-language major broadcast networks (NBC – WCAU, CBS – KYW-TV, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] – WPVI-TV, [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] – WTXF-TV and [[The CW]] – WPSG); three of the major Spanish-language networks ([[Univision]], [[UniMas]] and [[Telemundo]]) also have O&amp;Os serving the market (respectively, [[WUVP-DT]], [[WFPA-CA]] and [[WWSI]]).

Rock stations [[WMMR]] and WYSP had historically been intense rivals. However, in 2011, WYSP switched to sports talk as [[WIP-FM]], which broadcasts all [[Philadelphia Eagles]] games. WMMR's ''The [[Preston and Steve]] Show'' has been the area's top-rated morning show since [[Howard Stern]] left broadcast radio for satellite-based [[Sirius Radio]].

Four [[Urban music|urban]] stations ([[WUSL]] (&quot;Power 99&quot;), [[WPHI]] (&quot;Hot 107.9&quot;), [[WDAS-FM|WDAS]] and [[WRNB]] (&quot;Old School 100.3&quot;) are popular choices on the FM dial. [[WBEB]] is the city's [[Adult Contemporary]] station, while [[WRDW-FM|WRDW]] (&quot;Wired 96.5&quot;) is the major Rhythmic Top 40 station.

===Sports===

{{Main|Sports in Philadelphia|U.S. cities with teams from four major sports}}

Philadelphia's professional sports teams date at least to the 1860 founding of baseball's [[Philadelphia Athletics (1860-1876)|Athletics]]. The city is one of 12 U.S. cities to have [[U.S. cities with teams from four major sports|all four major sports]]: the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] of the [[National Football League]], the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] of the [[National Hockey League]], the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] in the [[National League]] of [[Major League Baseball]], and the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] in the [[National Basketball Association]].

The Philadelphia metro area is also home of the [[Philadelphia Union]] of [[Major League Soccer]]. The Union play their home games at [[PPL Park]], a [[soccer-specific stadium]] in Chester, Pennsylvania. Philadelphia began play in MLS in 2010, after beating several other cities in competition for the rights to an MLS expansion franchise. 

The city's professional teams went without a championship from 1983, when the 76ers won the [[1983 NBA Finals|NBA Championship]], until 2008, when the Phillies won the [[2008 World Series|World Series]]. In 2004, [[ESPN]] ranked Philadelphia second on its list of The Fifteen Most Tortured Sports Cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=news/local&amp;id=7489419|title=Philly reels from loss to Blackhawks|publisher=abclocal.go.com|work=WLS|first=Ravi|last=Baichwal|authorlink=Ravi Baichwal|date=June 10, 2010|accessdate=February 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The failure was sometimes attributed in jest to the &quot;[[Curse of Billy Penn]].&quot; 

Major-sport professional sports teams that originated in Philadelphia but ultimately moved to other cities include the [[Golden State Warriors]] basketball team and the [[Oakland Athletics]] baseball team.

Philadelphia is also the home city of the [[Philadelphia Spinners]], a professional ultimate team that is part of the American Ultimate Disc League. They are one of the original eight teams of the league that began in April 2012 and play their home games at the University of Pennsylvania.

Philadelphia is home to professional, semi-professional and elite amateur teams in cricket, rugby league ([[Philadelphia Fight]]), rugby union and other sports. Major sporting events in the city include the [[Penn Relays]], [[Stotesbury Cup]], [[Philadelphia Marathon]], [[Broad Street Run]], [[Philadelphia International Championship]] [[Bicycle racing|bicycle race]], and the [[Dad Vail Regatta]]. The [[Collegiate Rugby Championship]] is played every June at [[PPL Park]]; the CRC is broadcast live on NBC and regularly draws attendances of 18,000.

Philadelphia is home to the [[Philadelphia Big 5]], a group of five Division I college basketball programs. The Big 5 are [[Saint Joseph's University]], University of Pennsylvania, [[La Salle University]], [[Temple University]], and [[Villanova University]]. The sixth NCAA Division I school in Philadelphia is [[Drexel University]]. At least one of the teams is competitive nearly every year{{Vague|date=May 2012}} and at least one team has made the NCAA tournament for the past four decades{{Which|date=May 2012}}.

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Philadelphia}}

Philadelphia is the center of economic activity in [[Pennsylvania]]. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the Philadelphia area had a total gross metropolitan product of $347&amp;nbsp;billion in 2010, the [[List of metropolitan areas in the United States by GMP|seventh-largest metropolitan economy]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gross Metropolitan Product| url=http://www.bea.gov/iTable/iTableHtml.cfm?reqid=70&amp;step=10&amp;isuri=1&amp;7001=2200&amp;7002=2&amp;7003=200&amp;7004=NAICS&amp;7005=1&amp;7006=XX&amp;7007=2010 |publisher=U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis| date=September 29, 2011| accessdate=November 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With a gross domestic product of $388&amp;nbsp;billion, Philadelphia ranks ninth among world cities and fourth in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ukmediacentre.pwc.com/imagelibrary/downloadMedia.ashx?MediaDetailsID=1562|title=Global city GDP rankings 2008–2025|publisher=Pricewaterhouse Coopers|accessdate=November 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city is also the nation's fourth-largest consumer [[media market]], as ranked by the [[Nielsen Media Research]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gorman|first=Bill|title=Nielsen Local Television Market Universe Estimates|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2008/09/10/nielsen-local-television-market-universe-estimates/5037/|work=TVbytheNumbers|accessdate=July 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city is home to the [[Philadelphia Stock Exchange]] and several [[Fortune 500]] companies, including cable television and internet provider [[Comcast]], insurance companies [[Colonial Penn]], [[CIGNA]] and [[Lincoln Financial Group]], energy company [[Sunoco]], food services company [[Aramark]] and [[Crown Holdings Incorporated]], chemical makers [[Rohm and Haas Company]] and [[FMC Corporation]], pharmaceutical companies [[Wyeth]] and [[GlaxoSmithKline]], [[Boeing Rotorcraft Systems]], and automotive parts retailer [[Pep Boys]].

Philadelphia's economic sectors include information technology, manufacturing, oil refining, food processing, health care and biotechnology, tourism and financial services.

Philadelphia has shifted to an [[information technology]] and service-based economy. Financial activities account for the largest sector of the metro economy, and it is one of the largest health education and research centers in the United States. Philadelphia's history attracts many tourists, with the [[Liberty Bell]] receiving over 2 million visitors in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/inde/parkmgmt/statistics.htm Park Statistics], ''National Park Service''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law and government==
[[File:City Hall holiday.jpg|thumb|right|200 px|City Hall illuminated with projected lights for the 2005 winter holidays]]
From a governmental perspective, Philadelphia County is a [[legal nullity]], as all county functions were assumed by the city in 1952, which has been coterminous with the county since 1854.

Philadelphia's 1952 Home Rule Charter was written by the City Charter Commission, which was created by the Pennsylvania General Assembly in an Act of April 21, 1949, and a city ordinance of June 15, 1949. The existing City Council received a proposed draft on February 14, 1951, and the electors approved it in an election held April 17, 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seventy.org/Files/Philadelphia_Home_Rule_Charter.pdf |title=Philadelphia Home Rule Charter, Annotated |accessdate=January 31, 2010 |first=Charter Commission |date=1951 and 1967 |publisher=City of Philadelphia }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first elections under the new Home Rule Charter were held in November 1951, and the newly elected officials took office in January 1952.&lt;ref name=&quot;Charter&quot;&gt;

The city uses the strong-mayor version of the [[mayor-council]] form of government, which is headed by one mayor, in whom executive authority is vested. Elected [[at-large]], the mayor is limited to two consecutive four-year terms under the city's [[home rule]] charter, but can run for the position again after an intervening term. The Mayor is [[Michael Nutter]], who replaced [[John F. Street|John Street]], who served two terms from 1999 to January 2008. Nutter, as all Philadelphia mayors have been since 1952, is a member of the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]], which tends to dominate local politics so thoroughly that the Democratic Mayoral primary is often more widely covered than the general election. The legislative branch, the [[Philadelphia City Council]], consists of ten council members representing individual districts and seven members elected at large. Democrats currently hold 14 seats, with Republicans representing two allotted at-large seats for the minority party, as well as the [[Northeast Philadelphia|Northeast-based]] Tenth District. The current council president is [[Darrell L. Clarke (politician)|Darrell Clarke]].

===Courts===
The Philadelphia County [[Pennsylvania Courts of Common Pleas|Court of Common Pleas]] (First Judicial District) is the [[trial court]] of general jurisdiction for Philadelphia, hearing [[felony]]-level criminal cases and civil suits above the minimum jurisdictional limit of $7000 (excepting small claims cases valued between $7000 and $12000 and landlord-tenant issues heard in the Municipal Court) under its [[original jurisdiction]]; it also has [[appellate jurisdiction]] over rulings from the Municipal and Traffic Courts and over decisions of certain Pennsylvania state agencies (e.g. the [[Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board]]). It has 90 legally trained judges elected by the voters. It is funded and operated largely by city resources and employees.&lt;ref name='Common Pleas'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courts.phila.gov/common-pleas/ |title=Court of Common Pleas |accessdate=February 11, 2010 |date=February 11, 2010 |work=The Philadelphia Courts, First Judicial District of Pennsylvania }}&lt;/ref&gt; The current [[District Attorney of Philadelphia|District Attorney]] is [[R. Seth Williams|Seth Williams]], a Democrat. The last Republican to hold the office is [[Ronald D. Castille|Ron Castille]], who left in 1991 and is currently the Chief Justice of the State Supreme Court.

The [[Philadelphia Municipal Court]] handles matters of limited jurisdiction as well as landlord-tenant disputes, appeals from traffic court, preliminary hearings for felony-level offenses, and misdemeanor criminal trials. It has 25 legally trained judges elected by the voters.&lt;ref name='Municipal Court'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courts.phila.gov/municipal/ |title= MunicipalCourt |accessdate=February 11, 2010 |date=February 11, 2010 |work=The Philadelphia Courts, First Judicial District of Pennsylvania }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philadelphia Traffic Court is a court of special jurisdiction that hears violations of traffic laws. It has seven judges elected by the voters.&lt;ref name='Traffic Court'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courts.phila.gov/traffic/|title=Traffic Court |accessdate=February 11, 2010 |date=February 11, 2010 |work=The Philadelphia Courts, First Judicial District of Pennsylvania }}&lt;/ref&gt; As with magisterial district judges, the judges need not be lawyers, but must complete the certifying course and pass the qualifying examination administered by the Minor Judiciary Education Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Philadelphia Traffic Court |url=http://www.pacourts.us/Links/Public/AboutTheCourts.htm|publisher=Pennsylvania Unified Judicial System|accessdate=January 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pennsylvania's three [[appellate court]]s also have sittings in Philadelphia. The [[Supreme Court of Pennsylvania]], the court of last resort in the state, regularly hears arguments in [[Philadelphia City Hall]]. Also, the [[Superior Court of Pennsylvania]] and the [[Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania]] sit in Philadelphia several times a year. Judges for these courts are elected at large. Each court has a [[prothonotary]]'s office in Philadelphia as well.

From the [[American Civil War]] until the mid-20th century, Philadelphia was a bastion of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], which arose from the staunch pro-Northern views of Philadelphia residents during and after the war (Philadelphia was chosen as the host city for the first [[Republican National Convention]] in [[United States presidential election, 1856|1856]]). After the [[Great Depression]], Democratic registrations increased, but the city was not carried by Democrat [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in his landslide victory of [[United States presidential election, 1932|1932]] (in which Pennsylvania was one of the few states won by Republican [[Herbert Hoover]]). Four years later, however, voter turnout surged and the city finally flipped to the Democrats. Roosevelt carried Philadelphia with over 60% of the vote in [[United States presidential election, 1936|1936]]. The city has remained loyally Democratic in every presidential election since.

The city is now one of the most Democratic in the country; in 2008, Democrat [[Barack Obama]] drew 83% of the city's vote. Obama's win was even greater in 2012, capturing 85% of the vote.

Philadelphia once comprised six [[congressional district]]s. However, as a result of the city's declining population, it now has only four: [[Pennsylvania's 1st congressional district|the 1st district]], represented by [[Bob Brady]]; [[Pennsylvania's 2nd congressional district|the 2nd]], represented by [[Chaka Fattah]]; [[Pennsylvania's 8th congressional district|the 8th]], represented by [[Mike Fitzpatrick]]; and [[Pennsylvania's 13th congressional district|the 13th]], represented by [[Allyson Schwartz]]. All but Fitzpatrick are Democrats. Although they are usually swamped by Democrats in city, state and national elections, Republicans still have some support in the area; a Republican represented a significant portion of Philadelphia in the House as late as 1983, and [[Sam Katz (Philadelphia)|Sam Katz]] ran competitive Mayoral races as the Republican nominee in both [[Philadelphia mayoral election, 1999|1999]] and [[Philadelphia mayoral election, 2003|2003]]. Pennsylvania's longest-serving [[List of United States Senators from Pennsylvania|Senator]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Senator Arlen Specter to Teach At Penn Law|url=http://www.law.upenn.edu/blogs/news/archives/2011/01/senator_arlen_specter_to_teach_at_penn_law.html|work=News and Stories|publisher=The University of Pennsylvania School of Law|accessdate=February 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arlen Specter]], was from Philadelphia; he served as a Republican from 1981 and as a Democrat from 2009, losing that party's primary in [[United States Senate Democratic primary election in Pennsylvania, 2010|2010]] and leaving office in January 2011. He was also the city's District Attorney from 1966 to 1974.

The [[Philadelphia Housing Authority]] is the largest landlord in Pennsylvania. Established in 1937, it is the nation's fourth-largest housing authority, housing about 84,000 people and employing 1,250. In 2006, its budget was $313&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=&quot;PHA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pha.phila.gov/ |title=Philadelphia Housing Authority |publisher=Pha.phila.gov |accessdate=April 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Philadelphia Parking Authority]] works to ensure adequate parking for city residents, businesses and visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philapark.org/aboutPPA/history.aspx |title=Philadelphia Parking Authority: History |publisher=Philapark.org |accessdate=December 23, 2010}}{{dead link|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philadelphia's neighborhoods are divided into large sections—[[North Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|North]], [[Northeast Philadelphia|Northeast]], [[Northwest Philadelphia|Northwest]], [[West Philadelphia|West]], [[South Philadelphia|South]] and [[Southwest Philadelphia]]—all of which surround [[Center City, Philadelphia|Center City]], which corresponds closely with the city's limits before consolidation in 1854. Each of these large areas contains numerous neighborhoods, some of whose boundaries derive from the boroughs, townships, and other communities that made up Philadelphia County before their absorption into the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

===Crime===
{{Main|Crime in Philadelphia}}

Like many American cities, Philadelphia saw a gradual yet pronounced rise in crime in the years following World War II. There were 525 murders in 1990, a rate of 31.5 per 100,000. There were an average of about 600 murders a year for most of the 1990s. The murder count dropped in 2002 to 288, then rose four years later to 406 in 2006 and 392 in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|quotes= |last=Bewley |first=Joel |coauthors=Jan Hefler |year=2006 |month=December 11 |title=Four killings put 2006 total over '05 top |journal=The Philadelphia Inquirer |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_kmtpi/is_200612/ai_n16975780 }}{{dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Philadelphia's homicide rate of 27.7 per 100,000 people was the highest of the country's 10 most populous cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inquirer.philly.com/graphics/homicide_map_2007/ |title=Philadelphia Homicides in 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
{{Main|Education in Philadelphia}}
[[File:Penn campus 2.jpg|thumb|[[University of Pennsylvania]]]]

Education in Philadelphia is provided by many private and public institutions. The [[School District of Philadelphia]] runs the city's [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]]. The Philadelphia School District is the eighth largest [[school district]] in the United States with 163,064 students in 347 public and [[charter schools]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.phila.k12.pa.us/about/ |title= About Us – The School District of Philadelphia |publisher=Philadelphia School District |accessdate=March 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philadelphia has the second-largest student concentration on the East Coast, with over 120,000 college and university students enrolled within the city and nearly 300,000 in the metropolitan area. There are over 80 colleges, universities, trade, and specialty schools in the Philadelphia region. The city contains three major research universities: the [[University of Pennsylvania]], [[Drexel University]], and [[Temple University]]; and the city is home to five schools of medicine: [[Drexel University College of Medicine]], [[Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine]], [[Temple University School of Medicine]], [[Jefferson Medical College|Thomas Jefferson University]], and the [[University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine|University of Pennsylvania]].

==Transportation==
[[File:Philly 30th St. Station.jpg|thumb|30th Street Station, with [[Cira Centre]] in the background and statues on the Market Street Bridge over [[Schuylkill River]] in the foreground]]
{{Main|Transportation in Philadelphia}}

Philadelphia is served by the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority ([[SEPTA]]), which operates buses, trains, rapid transit, trolleys, and trackless trolleys throughout Philadelphia, the four Pennsylvania suburban counties of [[Bucks County, Pennsylvania|Bucks]], [[Chester County, Pennsylvania|Chester]], [[Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Delaware]], and [[Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Montgomery]], in addition to service to [[Mercer County, New Jersey]] and [[New Castle County, Delaware]]. The city's subway, opened in 1907, is the third-oldest in America.

In 1981, large sections of the [[SEPTA Regional Rail]] service to the far suburbs of Philadelphia were discontinued due to lack of funding.  Several projects have been proposed to extend rail service back to these areas, but lack of funding has again been the chief obstacle to implementation.  These projects include the proposed [[Schuylkill Valley Metro]] to Wyomissing, PA and extension of the Media/Elwyn line back to Wawa, PA.

SEPTA's [[Airport Line (SEPTA)|Airport Regional Rail Line]] Regional Rail offers direct service to the [[Philadelphia International Airport]].

Philadelphia's [[30th Street Station]] is a major railroad station on Amtrak's [[Northeast Corridor]], which offers access to Amtrak, SEPTA, and [[New Jersey Transit]] lines.

The [[PATCO Speedline]] provides rapid transit service to [[Camden, New Jersey|Camden]], [[Collingswood, New Jersey|Collingswood]], [[Westmont, New Jersey|Westmont]], [[Haddonfield, New Jersey|Haddonfield]], [[Cherry Hill, New Jersey|Woodcrest (Cherry Hill)]], [[Voorhees, New Jersey|Ashland (Voorhees)]], and [[Lindenwold, New Jersey|Lindenwold]], New Jersey, from stations on Locust Street between 16th and 15th, 13th and 12th, and 10th and 9th Streets, and on Market Street at 8th Street.

===Airports===
Two airports serve Philadelphia: the [[Philadelphia International Airport]] (PHL), straddling the southern boundary of the city, and the [[Northeast Philadelphia Airport]] (PNE), a general aviation reliever airport in [[Northeast Philadelphia]]. Philadelphia International Airport provides scheduled domestic and international air service, while Northeast Philadelphia Airport serves general and corporate aviation.  In 2010, Philadelphia International Airport was the 12th largest airport in the world [[World's busiest airports by traffic movements|measured by traffic movements]] (i.e. takeoffs and landings), and is also a primary hub for [[US Airways]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aci.aero/cda/aci/display/main/aci_content.jsp?zn=aci&amp;cp=1-5-54-57_9_2__ |title=Airports Council International |publisher=Aci.aero |accessdate=April 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roads===
[[File:Philadelphia Aerial.JPG|thumb|Aerial view showing the major highways circumscribing Philadelphia]]
[[File:Schuylkill Expressway Sept 2007.jpg|thumb|The [[Schuylkill Expressway]], approaching [[Center City, Philadelphia|Center City]] from the north]]

[[Interstate 95 in Pennsylvania|Interstate 95]] runs through the city along the Delaware River as a main north-south artery known as the Delaware Expressway. The city is also served by the [[Schuylkill Expressway]], a portion of [[Interstate 76 (east)|Interstate 76]] that runs along the [[Schuylkill River]]. It meets the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]] at King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, providing access to [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]] and points west. [[Interstate 676]], the [[Vine Street Expressway]], was completed in 1991 after years of planning. A link between I-95 and I-76, it runs below street level through Center City, connecting to the [[Ben Franklin Bridge]] at its eastern end.

[[Roosevelt Boulevard (Philadelphia)|Roosevelt Boulevard]] and the [[Roosevelt Expressway (Philadelphia)|Roosevelt Expressway]] ([[U.S. Route 1 in Pennsylvania|U.S. 1]]) connect [[Northeast Philadelphia]] with Center City. Woodhaven Road ([[Pennsylvania Route 63|Route 63]]), built in 1966, and Cottman Avenue ([[PA Route 73|Route 73]]) serve the neighborhoods of [[Northeast Philadelphia]], running between [[Interstate 95 in Pennsylvania|Interstate 95]] and the Roosevelt Boulevard ([[U.S. Route 1 in Pennsylvania|U.S. 1]]). The Fort Washington Expressway ([[Pennsylvania Route 309|Route 309]]) extends north from the city's northern border, serving [[Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Montgomery County]] and [[Bucks County, Pennsylvania|Bucks County]]. [[U.S. Route 30 in Pennsylvania|U.S. 30]], extending east-west from West Philadelphia to [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]], is known as [[Lancaster Avenue]] throughout most of the city and through the adjacent [[Pennsylvania Main Line|Main Line]] suburbs.

[[Interstate 476]], commonly nicknamed the &quot;Blue Route&quot; through [[Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Delaware County]], bypasses the city to the west, serving the city's western suburbs, as well as providing a link to [[Allentown, Pennsylvania|Allentown]] and points north. Similarly, [[Interstate 276]], the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]]'s Delaware River Extension, acts as a bypass and commuter route to the north of the city as well as a link to the [[New Jersey Turnpike]] to New York.

However, other planned freeways have been canceled, such as an [[Interstate 695 (Pennsylvania)|Interstate 695]] running southwest from downtown, two freeways connecting [[Interstate 95 in Pennsylvania|Interstate 95]] to [[Interstate 76 (east)|Interstate 76]] that would have replaced Girard Avenue and South Street, and a freeway upgrade of [[Roosevelt Boulevard (Philadelphia)|Roosevelt Boulevard]].

The [[Delaware River Port Authority]] operates four bridges in the Philadelphia area across the [[Delaware River]] to [[New Jersey]]: the [[Walt Whitman Bridge]] (I-76), the [[Benjamin Franklin Bridge]] (I-676 and [[U.S. Route 30 in Pennsylvania|US 30]]), the [[Betsy Ross Bridge]] ([[New Jersey Route 90|Route 90]]), and the [[Commodore Barry Bridge]] ([[U.S. Highway 322|US 322]]). The [[Tacony-Palmyra Bridge]] connects [[Pennsylvania Route 73|PA Route 73]] in the [[Tacony, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Tacony]] section of [[Northeast Philadelphia]] with New Jersey's [[New Jersey Route 73|Route 73]] in [[Palmyra, New Jersey|Palmyra]], [[Camden County, New Jersey|Camden County]], and is maintained by the [[Burlington County Bridge Commission]].

===Bus service===
Philadelphia is also a major hub for [[Greyhound Lines]], which operates 24-hour service to points east of the [[Mississippi River]]. Most of Greyhound's services in Philadelphia operate to/from the [[Philadelphia Greyhound Terminal]], located at 1001 Filbert Street in Center City Philadelphia. In 2006, the Philadelphia Greyhound Terminal was the second busiest Greyhound terminal in the United States, after the [[Port Authority Bus Terminal]] in New York. Besides Greyhound, six other bus operators provide service to the Center City Greyhound terminal: [[Bieber Tourways]], [[Capitol Trailways]], [[Trailways Transportation System|Martz Trailways]], [[Peter Pan Bus Lines]], [[Susquehanna Trailways]], and the [[New Jersey Transit Bus Operations|bus division for New Jersey Transit]]. Other services include [[Megabus (United States)|Megabus]] and [[Bolt Bus]].

===Rail===
{{Main|History of rail transport in Philadelphia}}
[[File:Suburban Station Facade.jpg|thumb|Suburban Station]]

Since the early days of [[rail transport in the United States]], Philadelphia has served as hub for several major rail companies, particularly the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] and the [[Reading Railroad]]. The Pennsylvania Railroad first operated [[Broad Street Station (Philadelphia)|Broad Street Station]], then [[30th Street Station (Philadelphia)|30th Street Station]] and [[Suburban Station (Philadelphia)|Suburban Station]], and the Reading Railroad operated out of [[Reading Terminal]], now part of the [[Pennsylvania Convention Center]]. The two companies also operated competing commuter rail systems in the area, known collectively as the Regional Rail system. The two systems today, for the most part still intact but now connected, operate as a single system under the control of the [[Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority|SEPTA]], the regional transit authority. Additionally, the [[PATCO Speedline]] subway system and [[New Jersey Transit]]'s [[Atlantic City Line]] operate successor services to southern [[New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{PDFlink|http://www.njtransit.com/pdf/rail/r0090.pdf|218&amp;nbsp;KB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philadelphia, once home to more than 4,000 [[tram|trolleys]] on 65 lines,&lt;ref name=&quot;route34&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = Studio 34's Eponymous Trolley, or, A Short History of Route 34| publisher=Studio 34: Yoga Healing Arts | year = 2008 | url = http://www.studio34yoga.com/trolley.shtml| accessdate=March 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the few North American cities to maintain [[streetcar]] lines. Today, SEPTA operates five &quot;subway-surface&quot; trolleys that run on street-level tracks in West Philadelphia and subway tunnels in [[Center City, Philadelphia|Center City]]. SEPTA also recently{{when|date=May 2012}} reintroduced trolley service to the [[Route 15 (SEPTA)|Girard Avenue Line]], Route 15.

Today, Philadelphia is a regional hub of the [[Government corporation|federally owned]] [[Amtrak]] system, with 30th Street Station being a primary stop on the Washington-Boston [[Northeast Corridor]] and the [[Keystone Corridor]] to [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]] and [[Pittsburgh]]. 30th Street also serves as a major station for services via the Pennsylvania Railroad's former [[Main Line (Pennsylvania Railroad)|Pennsylvania Main Line]] to Chicago. 30th Street is Amtrak's third-busiest station in numbers of passengers as of [[fiscal year]] 2003.{{Update after|2011|06|11}}

===Walkability===
A 2011 study by [[Walk Score]] ranked Philadelphia the fifth most walkable major city in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.walkscore.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/2011MostWalkableCities.pdf|title=New York, San Francisco and Boston top Walk Score’s rankings of America’s Most Walkable Cities and Neighborhoods |publisher=Walk Score |year=2011 |accessdate=Aug 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Utilities==

===Telecommunications===
[[File:Philadelphia1.jpg|thumb|Skyline at night]]
Southeastern Pennsylvania was assigned the [[area code 215|215]] [[area code]] in 1947 when the [[North American Numbering Plan]] of the &quot;[[Bell System]]&quot; went into effect. The geographic area covered by the code was split nearly in half in 1994 when [[area code 610]] was created, with the city and its northern suburbs retaining 215. [[area code overlay|Overlay area code]] 267 was added to the 215 service area in 1997, and 484 was added to the 610 area in 1999. A plan in 2001 to introduce a third overlay code to both service areas ([[area code 445]] to 215, [[area code 835]] to 610) was delayed and later rescinded.&lt;ref&gt;{{PDFlink|[http://www.nanpa.com/pdf/PL_332_v1.pdf PA 445 Implementation for 215/267 NPA Rescinded – 445 NPA Code Reclaimed]|64.5&amp;nbsp;KB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philadelphia is now also served by Wireless Philadelphia, a citywide initiative to provide [[Wi-Fi]] service. The proof of concept area was approved on May 23, 2007, and service is now available in many areas of the city; although discontinued by Earthlink.

===United States Postal Service===

Philadelphia has dedicated landmarks to its sister cities. Dedicated in June 1976, the Sister Cities Plaza, a site of {{convert|0.5|acre|m2}} located at 18th and Benjamin Franklin Parkway, honors Philadelphia's relationships with [[Tel Aviv]] and [[Florence]] which were its first Sister Cities. Another landmark, the Toruń Triangle, honoring the Sister City relationship with [[Toruń]], Poland, was constructed in 1976, west of the [[United Way of America|United Way]] building at 18th Street and the Benjamin Franklin Parkway. In addition, the Triangle contains the Copernicus monument. Renovations were made to Sister Cities Park in mid-2011 and on May 10, 2012, SCP was reopened and currently features an interactive fountain honoring Philadelphia's ten sister and friendship cities, a café and visitor's center, children's play area, outdoor garden, and boat pond, as well as pavilion built to [[environmentally friendly]] standards.&lt;ref name=&quot;renovation&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ivc.org/sister_cities_park | title=Sister Cities park | publisher=International Visitors Council of Philadelphia | accessdate=June 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinatown Gate, erected in 1984 and crafted by artisans of [[Tianjin, China]], stands astride the intersection of 10th and Arch Streets as an elaborate and colorful symbol of the Sister City relationship. The IVC of Philadelphia has participated in the [[U.S. Department of State]]'s &quot;Partners for Peace&quot; project with [[Mosul, Iraq]],&lt;ref name=&quot;mosul&quot;&gt;[http://www.ivc.org/mosul/ IVC of Philadelphia Partners with Mosul, Iraq in Groundbreaking Program] Retrieved January 26, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as accepting visiting delegations from dozens of other countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;ivc&quot;&gt;[http://www.ivc.org/inbound_delegations Inbound delegations visiting Philadelphia] Retrieved January 26, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''St. Marys''' is a city in [[Elk County, Pennsylvania|Elk County]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[United States]]. The population was 13,070 at the [[United States Census 2010|2010 census]].  Originally a small, Bavarian Catholic town, St. Marys was founded December 8, 1842. It is home to [[Straub Beer|Straub Brewery]] and the first [[Benedictine]] [[convent]] in the United States. In 1992, the borough of St. Marys absorbed the surrounding township of [[Benzinger Township, Elk County, Pennsylvania|Benzinger]] and incorporated as a city,&lt;ref name=&quot;StMarysPDF&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Saint Marys City Code - History |date=2007-12-17 |url=http://www.cityofstmarys.com/2440-foreword.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; though much of the city's area remains wild.

St. Marys lies in the center of Pennsylvania's [[elk]] country. It is one of the few places east of the [[Mississippi River]] that allows hunting of wild elk. The area is known for its access to outdoor activities, including trout streams and state hunting lands inside the city limits.

==History==
The town was originally founded as Marienstadt (Mary's City). Many historic structures are located within the boundaries of the [[St. Marys Historic District (St. Marys, Pennsylvania)|St. Marys Historic District]], added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1998.

'''New Kensington''' is a city in [[Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania|Westmoreland County]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Pennsylvania]], situated along the [[Allegheny River]] {{convert|18|mi|km}} northeast of [[Pittsburgh]]. The population was 13,116 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 Census]]. The mayor is Tom Guzzo (D), elected in 2009; he succeeded Frank Link (D), elected in 2001.

==History==
Like much of Westmoreland County and surrounding areas, the region was a hunting ground for Native Americans of the [[Six Nations]]
European-American settlement began in the mid-1700s. Continental army troops built Fort Crawford, near the mouth of [[Pucketa Creek]], in 1777. The fort was abandoned in 1793. 

Originally part of Burrell (and later Lower Burrell) township, the city of New Kensington was founded in 1891. In 1890, the Burrell Improvement Company considered the advantages of the level land south of its home in [[Lower Burrell, Pennsylvania|Lower Burrell]], and deemed it a prime location for a city and named the area &quot;[[Kensington, Pennsylvania|Kensington]]&quot; (later changed to &quot;New Kensington&quot; for postal purposes, because Pennsylvania already had another city with that name). In an attempt to make New Kensington comparable to Pittsburgh, the streets were named with numbers. Avenues ran parallel to the river, while streets were perpendicular. The main commercial streets were 4th and 5th avenues. 

Once the land was surveyed, a public sale was held on June 10, 1891. Thousands of people flooded the area and investors began bringing industry with them. The first large company was the Pittsburgh Reduction Company, which later became [[Alcoa]]. They acquired a {{convert|3.5|acre|m2|sing=on}} property that allowed the company to utilize the riverfront.  The Alcoa facility remained operational until the 1960s. 

Eventually, other companies as Adams Drilling, Goldsmith and Lowerburg, New Kensington Milling, New Kensington Brewing, Logan Lumber, Keystone Dairy, and many more were built late in the 19th century and continuing into the early 20th century. Early achievements included a railroad station, the 9th Street bridge, a passenger boat that navigated the Allegheny River, a street car line that ran to [[Natrona, Pennsylvania|Natrona]] via the [[West Penn Railways]], the ''Kensington Dispatch'' newspaper, a fire department, hotel, opera house, and a local chapter of the [[YMCA]]. New Kensington annexed the independent borough of Parnassus in 1939. 

In 1941, New Kensington became the site of a modern workers' housing project—named the ''Aluminum City Terrace''—designed by [[Marcel Breuer]] and [[Walter Gropius]], which set new standards for federal housing design. Breuer and Gropius ascribed to the famous [[Bauhaus|Bauhaus School of Design]] in Germany. Intended for Alcoa defense workers, it was subsequently used to rehouse displaced residents from other parts of the city. In 1948, tenants from the Terrace decided to purchase the housing project from the U.S. government to form a co-op, managed by a Board of Directors, elected by representatives from the 250 units. Relatively low-cost monthly fees continue to cover the costs of running the Terrace.

Today, New Kensington contains the neighborhoods of Parnassus, Mount Vernon, Valley Heights, Valley Camp, Pine Manor, and 40 Acres.

The [[New Kensington Downtown Historic District]], [[New Kensington Production Works Historic District]], and [[Mount St. Peter Roman Catholic Church]] are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nris&quot;&gt;{{NRISref|version=2010a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two radio stations, [[WGBN]]-AM and [[WBZZ]], are both licensed to New Kensington, and serve the Pittsburgh radio media market.

Since the 1970s, the city's downtown has been plagued by high vacancy rates.

==History==
Perhaps the oldest historical reference to the area that became Jeannette is the role the area played in the Pontiac War in 1763.  The Bushy Run Battlefield marks the spot where Colonel Henry Boquet led the British and American troops to defeat the Indians in a battle on the 5th and 6 August that year.  This victory is credited with helping to prevent the capture of Fort Pitt, and it served the purpose of reopening communication and supply lines.  Today, this {{convert|200|acre|km2|adj=on}} historical landmark is the site of a museum, nature trails, picnic areas, and an annual reenactment of the Battle of Bushy Run.

First incorporated as a borough on June 7, 1889,&lt;ref&gt;[http://pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/rss/s_490133.html &quot;Jeannette hopes to reclaim glory of manufacturing heyday&quot;], , Tribune Review, January 28, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Jeannette earned the nickname as &quot;the glass city&quot; in recognition of the numerous glass plants founded in the area, with those factories contributing to the city's original stature as the first large manufacturing town in [[Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania|Westmoreland County]].  In fact, the impact of the glass industry was so significant that the city's name actually comes from Jeannette E. Hartupee McKee, the wife of H. Sellers McKee, a local industrialist who cofounded the Chambers and McKee Glass Works and was a member of the elite [[South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club]] of [[Johnstown Flood]] fame.&lt;ref&gt;John N. Boucher, &quot;History of Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania&quot;, The Lewis Publishing Co., 1906. Pages 504-505, http://homepages.rootsweb.com/~mhender/jeanette.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Mckee and his partner J.A. Chambers also have the distinction of naming Jeannette's main street, Clay Avenue after their financial backer, Richard W. Clay.  On January 1, 1938, Jeannette became a third class city with Attorney John M. OConnell as the first mayor.&lt;ref&gt;Great Towns in Westmoreland, &quot;Jeannette A Great Town in Westmoreland County&quot;, http://www.inwestmoreland.com/wclocalinfo/towns/jeannette/index.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

At times, there were as many as 7 significant glass factories operating in the city of Jeannette including some of the most well known in the history of the glass industry.   Names like Jeannette Glass; Fort Pitt Glass; the Pittsburgh Lamp, Brass and Glass Company; American-Saint Gobain, [[Westmoreland Glass Company|Westmoreland Glass]]; and others all supplied the country with everything from plate glass windows, to bottles, to milk glass, and much more for many decades.  Some estimates over the years indicate that Jeannette once produced somewhere between 70-85% of the world's glass.  Unfortunately, the Jeannette's glass industry was one of the early United States industry victims of cheap, foreign competition that made it less expensive to produce glass overseas and today only two glass factories remain in the city.

Jeannette's manufacturing history doesn't end with the glass industry.  Today's [[Elliott Company]] represents an evolution dating back to 1914 when William Swan Elliott moved his company to Jeannette.  The Elliott Company, owned by the Carrier Corporation from 1957 until 1979 and by United Technologies Corporation until a 1987 buyout that returned the company to a privately owned status, only to become an [[Ebara Corporation]] subsidiary in 2000, has always had a solid reputation in the dynamo, turbine, and large rotating equipment industry.  In 1952, the company produced the first diesel-engine [[turbocharger]] used in a racecar and subsequently built more than 40,000 more of them for other diesel applications.  Throughout the 1970s, local residents routinely witnessed a revolving door of trains hauling parts into the plant on North 4th Street and hauling the huge turbine engines back down the tracks.&lt;ref&gt;A History of Accomplishments, Elliott Company Website&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the Elliott Company is the city's largest employer.&lt;ref&gt;Great Towns in Westmoreland, &quot;Jeannette A Great Town in Westmoreland County&quot;, http://www.inwestmoreland.com/wclocalinfo/towns/jeannette/index.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;  Jeannette is also the manufacturing home of Jensen Steam Engine Mfg. Co., Inc., which produces small working models of steam engines and turbines.  The Jensen shop is only a few blocks from the Elliott plant.

The Pennsylvania Rubber Works, which moved to Jeannette from Erie, Pennsylvania, around 1903, was yet another key part of the city's significant industrial base.  Not only did this factory become a significant supplier of play balls (basketballs, footballs, tennis balls, etc.) and carpet underlay as part of General Tire in its later years; but the original Pennsylvania Rubber Works provided products for [[Jeep#The_origins_of_the_vehicle:_the_first_jeeps|Jeeps]] and gas masks during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/rss/s_490133.html &quot;Jeannette hopes to reclaim glory of manufacturing heyday&quot;], , Tribune Review, January 28, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1943, the city went before the Supreme Court to defend an ordinance that banned distributing religious materials door to door.  Several members of the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] challenged the constitutionality of the law but were defeated in ''[[Douglas v. City of Jeannette]]''.

==History==

===Sugarloaf Massacre===
{{refimprove-section|date=July 2013}}
{{Main|Sugarloaf Massacre}}
During the height of the [[American Revolution]] in the summer of 1780, British sympathizers, known as [[Tories]], concentrated from New York's [[Mohawk Valley]], began attacking [[Patriot (American Revolution)|patriot]] outposts located along the [[Susquehanna River]] Valley in Northeast [[Pennsylvania]]. Because of the reports of [[Tory]] activity in the region, Captain Daniel Klader and a [[platoon]] of 41 men from [[Northampton County, Pennsylvania|Northampton County]] were sent to investigate. They traveled north from the [[Lehigh Valley]] along a path known as &quot;Warrior's Trail,&quot; which is present-day [[Pennsylvania Route 93|State Route 93]], since this route connects the [[Lehigh River]] in [[Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania|Jim Thorpe]] (formerly known as Mauch Chunk) to the [[Susquehanna River]] in [[Berwick, Pennsylvania|Berwick]].

Heading north, Captain Klader's men made it as far north as present-day [[Conyngham, Pennsylvania|Conyngham]] when they were ambushed by members of the [[Seneca tribe]] and [[Tory]] militiamen. In all, 15 men were killed on September 11, 1780 in what was known the Sugarloaf Massacre.

The [[Moravian Church|Moravians]], a [[Christian]] [[Religious denomination|denomination]], had been using &quot;Warrior's Trail&quot; since the early 18th century after the Moravian [[missionary]] [[Nicolaus Ludwig Zinzendorf]] first used it to reach the [[Wyoming Valley]]. This particular stretch of &quot;Warrior's Trail&quot; had an abundance of [[hazel]] trees. Though the Moravians called the region &quot;[[St. Anthony's Wilderness]]&quot;, it eventually became known as &quot;Hazel Swamp,&quot; a name which had been used previously by the Indians.

The Moravian missionaries were sent from their settlements in [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania|Bethlehem]] to the site of the Sugarloaf Massacre to bury the dead soldiers. Because of the aesthetic natural beauty of the Conyngham Valley, some Moravians decided to stay and in 1782, built a settlement, St. Johns, along the Nescopeck Creek, which is near the present-day intersection of [[Interstate 80|Interstates 80]] and [[Interstate 81|81]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hazletonhistory.8m.com/history_origins.htm Greater Hazleton Historical Society&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jacob Drumheller's Stage Stand===
In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the &quot;Warrior Trail&quot; was widened and became the Berwick Turnpike. Later, a road was built to connect [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania|Wilkes-Barre]] to [[McKeansburg, Pennsylvania|McKeansburg]]. This road intersected with the Berwick Turnpike at what is present-day Broad and Vine Streets, in downtown Hazleton. An [[entrepreneur]] named Jacob Drumheller decided that this intersection was the perfect location for a rest-stop, so in 1809, he built the first building in what would be later known as Hazleton. Though a few buildings and houses began to be built nearby, the area remained a dense wilderness for about 20 more years. Aside from small-scale [[logging]], the area offered little else. Jacob Drumheller is buried at Conyngham Union Cemetery.

===Discovery of coal===
[[File:Bethlehem Steel.jpg|thumb|right|Anthracite coal mined from Hazleton was shipped via the Lehigh Canal to Bethlehem Steel Corporation during the American Industrial Revolution.]]
[[Railroad]] developers from [[Philadelphia]] became interested in the Hazleton area once previous rumors were validated that in 1818 [[anthracite]] [[coal]] deposits had been discovered in near-by [[Beaver Meadows]] by prospectors [[Nathaniel Beach]] and [[Tench Coxe]].

A young [[engineer]] from [[New York]] named Ariovistus &quot;Ario&quot; Pardee was hired to survey the [[topography]] of Beaver Meadows and report the practicality of extending a railroad from the [[Lehigh River Canal]] in Jim Thorpe to Beaver Meadows. Pardee, knowing that the area of Beaver Meadows was already controlled by Coxe and Beach, bought many acres of the land in present-day Hazleton. The investment proved to be extraordinarily lucrative. The land contained part of a massive anthracite coal field. Pardee will be forever known as the founding father of Hazleton.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

Pardee incorporated the [[Hazleton Coal Company]] in 1836, the same year that the rail link to the [[Lehigh Valley]] market was about to be completed.

The Hazleton Coal Company built the first school on Church Street, where Hazleton City Hall is now located. Pardee also built the first [[church (building)|church]] in Hazleton located at Church and Broad Streets. The Pardee mansion was built on the northern block of Broad Street, between present-day Church and Laurel Streets.

The coal industry attracted many immigrants for labour, mostly German and Irish in the 1840s and 1850s, and mostly Italian, Polish, Russian, Lithuanian, and Slovak in the 1860s to 1920s.

The coal mined in Hazleton helped to establish the [[United States]] as a world industrial power, primarily fueling the massive [[blast furnace]]s at the [[Bethlehem Steel|Bethlehem Steel Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hazletonhistory.8m.com/coal.htm Greater Hazleton Historical Society&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===&quot;Patch Towns&quot;===
Many small [[company town]]s, often referred to by locals as &quot;patch towns&quot; or &quot;patches&quot; surrounded Hazleton and were built by coal companies to provide housing for the miners and their families. These include:

* [[Beaver Meadows, Pennsylvania|Beaver Meadows]], coal was discovered here
* Stockton, founded by John Stockton
* Jeansville, founded by James Milens
* Milnesville, founded by James Milens
* [[Tresckow, Pennsylvania|Tresckow]], formerly known as Dutchtown
* Junedale, formerly known as Colraine
* [[Freeland, Pennsylvania|Freeland]], originally called Freehold (South of South Herberton; founded by Joseph Birkbeck in 1846)
* [[McAdoo, Pennsylvania|McAdoo]], originally called Pleasant Hill, then Saylors Hill
* [[West Hazleton, Pennsylvania|West Hazleton]], founded by Conrad Horn
* [[Eckley, Pennsylvania|Eckley]], founded by Eckley B. Coxe
* [[Jeddo, Pennsylvania|Jeddo]], named after a Japanese port in which coal was exported to by the Hazleton Coal Company
* [[Hollywood, Luzerne County, Pennsylvania|Hollywood]], area now part of Hazleton, named before [[Hollywood, California]].
* [[Weatherly, Pennsylvania|Weatherly]], small borough outside of Hazleton

===Sudden prosperity and growth===
[[File:Lattimer massacre.jpg|thumb|right|Mine workers began their protest march near Harwood and many were eventually killed by the Luzerne County sheriff in Lattimer in 1897.]]
Hazleton was incorporated as a [[Borough (Pennsylvania)|borough]] on January 5, 1857. Its intended name was supposed to be spelled &quot;Hazelton&quot; but a clerk misspelled the name during incorporation, and the name &quot;Hazleton&quot; has been used ever since.  The borough's first [[fire company]], the Pioneer Fire Company, was organized in 1867 by soldiers returning from the [[American Civil War]]. Hazleton was incorporated as a city on December 4, 1891. The population then was estimated to be around 14,000 people.

In 1891, Hazleton became the third city in the United States to establish a city-wide electric grid.

On September 10, 1897, the [[Lattimer Massacre]] occurred near Hazleton.

===Post WWII Hazleton===
After World War II, the demand for coal began to decline as cleaner, more efficient fuels were being used. Readily available, cheap energy helped open the door for manufacturing. The Duplan [[Silk]] Corporation opened and became the world's largest silk mill.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hazletonhistory.8m.com/duplan.htm Greater Hazleton Historical Society&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The garment industry thrived and was invested in by New York [[mobster]] [[Albert Anastasia]].{{fact|date=April 2013}}.

In 1947, [[Autolite]] Corporation was looking to expand operations in the East, and had been looking into Hazleton. Officials from Autolite came to the area to survey it and in their report, they noted Hazleton is a &quot;mountain wilderness&quot; with no major water route, rail route, trucking route, or airport. In response, several area leaders gathered to address these problems.

CAN-DO (Community Area New Development Organization) was formally organized in 1956 by founder [[Dr. Edgar L. Dessen]]. Their main goal was to raise money, through their &quot;Dime A Week&quot; campaign, in which area residents were encouraged to put a dime on their sidewalk each week to be collected by CANDO. The company raised over $250,000 and was able to purchase over {{convert|500|acre|km2}} of land, which was converted into an industrial park. Because of CANDO's efforts, Hazleton was given the [[All-America City Award]] in 1964. Hazleton's economy is now based largely on manufacturing and shipping, facilitated by the relative closeness to [[Interstate 80|Interstates 80]] and [[Interstate 81|81]].

An article published in December 2002 by ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' was entitled &quot;Letter from Pennsylvania: A town in need of a tomorrow&quot; which reported Hazleton's shortcomings to the world. It was criticized by local politicians and business leaders alike, and again prompted local leaders to address the problems facing the community.

===Changing demographics and a new wave of immigrants===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Mayor lou barletta 1.jpg|thumb|right|Mayor [[Louis J. Barletta]] on a June 22, 2006 television appearance on MSNBC's ''Scarborough Country'' debating Hazleton's IIRA.]] --&gt;
In 2006, Hazleton gained national attention as [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] mayor [[Lou Barletta]] and council members passed the [[Illegal Immigration Relief Act]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smalltowndefenders.com/public/node/6 Text of the ordinances]&lt;/ref&gt; This [[local ordinance|ordinance]] was instituted to discourage hiring or renting to illegal immigrants. Initially, the ordinance levied an administrative fine on landlords for $1,000 per illegal immigrant rented to and a loss of permits for non-compliance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smalltowndefenders.com/public/node/6 Illegal Immigration Relief Act passed | Small Town Defenders - Hazleton, Pennsylvania&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Another act passed concurrently made [[English language|English]] the [[official language]] of Hazleton.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smalltowndefenders.com/090806/2006-19%20_Official%20English.pdf 2006-19 _Official English&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mayor Lou Barletta of Hazleton estimated that as &quot;many as half&quot; of the estimated 10,000 Hispanics who were living in Hazleton left Hazleton when the ordinance was passed.&lt;ref name=&quot;washtimes&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/national/20060921-110748-4227r.htm |newspaper=Washington Times |title=Towns take a local approach to blocking illegal aliens |date=2006-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue was covered by the television program ''[[60 Minutes]]'' in 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/11/17/60minutes/main2195789.shtml | work=CBS News | title=Welcome To Hazleton | date=November 17, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Fox News]]'' show ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]'' in March 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.billoreilly.com/show?action=viewTVShow&amp;showID=1245#2 BillOReilly.com: The O'Reilly Factor Flash&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ordinance was criticized as illegal and [[unconstitutional]]. A number of residents (landlords, business owners, lawful aliens defined as illegal under the act, and unlawful aliens)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aclupa.org/downloads/HazeltonComplaint.pdf Initial Complaint]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aclupa.org/downloads/hzamendedcomplaint1.pdf First Amended Complaint]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aclupa.org/downloads/Hz2dAmendedComplaint.pdf Second Amended Complaint]&lt;/ref&gt; filed suit to strike down the law, claiming it violates the [[Supremacy Clause]] of the [[U.S. Constitution]] as well as the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment (U.S.)|Fourteenth Amendment]]s to the Constitution. After a trial and several appeals including a remand from the [[Supreme Court of the United States | Supreme Court]], the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit | Third Circuit]] found the ordinance invalid due to [[federal preemption]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/073531p.pdf Lozano v. City of Hazleton (3rd Cir. 2013)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Butler''' is city and [[county seat]] of [[Butler County, Pennsylvania|Butler County]] in the US state of [[Pennsylvania]],{{GR|6}} situated {{convert|35|mi}} north of [[Pittsburgh]] and part of the [[Pittsburgh metropolitan area]].  As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the city population was 13,757. Butler was named the 7th best small town in America by Smithsonian Magazine in May 2012.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/The-20-Best-Small-Towns-in-America.html#ixzz1uIRU5DFG 20 Best Small Towns in America; Smithsonian Magazine; May 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Image:Pennsylvania Route 8 in Butler.jpg|thumb|left|Downtown Butler]]
Butler was named for [[Richard Butler (general)|Maj. Gen. Richard Butler]],&lt;ref name=GAZ&gt;An Historical Gazetteer of Butler County, Pennsylvania, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; who fell at the [[St. Clair's Defeat|Battle of the Wabash]], also known as St. Clair's Defeat, in western [[Ohio]] in 1791.

In 1803 John and Samuel Cunningham became the first settlers in the village of Butler.  After settling in Butler, the two brothers laid out the community by drawing up plots of land for more incoming settlers.&lt;ref name=&quot;GAZ&quot;/&gt;  By 1817, the community was incorporated into a borough.&lt;ref name=&quot;GAZ&quot;/&gt;  The first settlers were of Irish or Scottish descent and were driving westward from [[Connecticut]]. In 1802 the German immigrants began arriving, with Detmar Basse settling in Jackson Township in 1802 and founding [[Zelienople, Pennsylvania|Zelienople]] the following year. After [[George Rapp]] arrived in 1805 and founded [[Harmony, Pennsylvania|Harmony]], larger numbers of settlers followed. [[John A. Roebling]] settled [[Saxonburg, Pennsylvania|Saxonburg]] in 1832, by which time most of the county was filled with German settlers.

Throughout most of its history, the city of Butler has been a major manufacturing and industrial center. In 1902, the [[Standard Steel Car Company]] opened one of its largest [[railcar]] manufacturing facilities in Butler.  It was here that some of the first all steel rail cars were built.  [[Diamond Jim Brady]], the legendary financier, gourmand and gemophile, got his start here in 1902 when he established the Standard Steel Car Company, which merged with the [[Pullman Palace Car Company]] in 1934 to create Pullman-Standard, a monopoly that was eventually broken by the government. The Pullman-Standard plant closed in 1982, and was demolished in 2005.  The site is now occupied by a [[strip mall]], as well as the new [[Butler Transit Authority]] intermodal facility.  In 2011 the BTA moved a [[covered hopper]] railcar to the bus terminal in recognition of the former Pullman-Standard plant.  The car was built at the facility in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Kelly B. |last=Garrett |title=Pullman railcar honors past |newspaper=[[Butler Eagle]] |date=February 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Another notable business headquartered in the city was the [[American Austin Car Company]] (1929–41).  The modern [[Jeep]] was created by the company when it was later called American Bantam Car Company.  The first prototypes of the vehicle were manufactured at the Butler facility.  Big military contracts eventually went to Willys and Ford, and the Bantam factory failed during World War II.  Bantam was also an early producer of small fuel-efficient vehicles.  

Butler is home to one of the few original Ford dealers left that Henry Ford authorized when he created the first car dealers.&lt;ref&gt;http://butlercountyford.dealerconnection.com/?lang=en&lt;/ref&gt;  

In the 1950s, Butler became one of the first cities to install bells at cross walks, a common practice today.  

The city was linked to [[Pittsburgh]] via [[Mars, Pennsylvania|Mars]] in 1907 by the [[Pittsburgh and Butler Street Railway]] and to [[Evans City, Pennsylvania|Evans City]] in 1908 by the [[Pittsburgh, Harmony, Butler and New Castle Railway]], both [[interurban]] trolley lines. The Mars route closed in April 1931, followed by the Evans City line on August 15, 1931 with the trolleys replaced by buses.

== Geography ==
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|2.7|sqmi|km2}}, all land.

'''Beaver Falls''' is a city in [[Beaver County, Pennsylvania|Beaver County]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[United States]]. The population was 8,987 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. It is located 31 miles (50&amp;nbsp;km) northwest of [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], and on the [[Beaver River (Pennsylvania)|Beaver River]], six miles (9&amp;nbsp;km) from its confluence with the [[Ohio River]].

In the 1870s, Beaver Falls was home to a [[Chinatowns in the United States#Pennsylvania|Chinatown]] and had as many as 200 Chinese residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bchistory.org/beavercounty/BeaverCountyTopical/racerelations/ChineseinBFM99/ChineseinBFMSP99.html|title=Chinese Workers In Beaver Falls}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Travellers would often stop in Beaver Falls while transversing Western Pennsylvania, since there were many modes of transportation through the area (railroad, highway, canal). The city was also linked to [[Ellwood City, Pennsylvania|Ellwood City]] in 1914 by the [[Pittsburgh, Harmony, Butler and New Castle Railway]], an [[interurban]] trolley line. The line closed on 15 June 1931.

[[Image:Beaver Falls.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Beaver Falls seen from [[Geneva College]]]]The city is best known in fiction as the setting of the [[television]] [[situation comedy]] ''[[Mr. Belvedere]]''.

On May 31, 1985, an F3 [[tornado]] hit just north of the city as it went across northern portions of Beaver County, as part of the [[1985 United States-Canadian tornado outbreak]].&lt;ref&gt;Britten, Kenneth, ''Beaver Falls Gem of Beaver County'', Arcadia Publishing, 2002, ISBN 0-7385-2382-8.&lt;/ref&gt;    [[Geneva College]] is located in the [[College Hill (Beaver Falls)|College Hill]] neighborhood on the north side of the city.  The world's first recorded college [[basketball]] game occurred in the city on April 8, 1893 when the [[Intramural sports|intramural]] team from Geneva College defeated the [[New Brighton, Pennsylvania|New Brighton]] [[YMCA]].

Nearly 50% of the population had dropped between 1940 and 2000, which is attributed mostly to its central location in the [[Rust Belt]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.census.gov/prod/www/abs/decennial/1940.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.census.gov/prod/www/abs/decennial/1960cenpopv1.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.census.gov/prod/cen1990/cph2/cph-2-1-1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Several manufacturing plants provided significant employment for residents in the twentieth century. Like most rust belt cities, Beaver Falls has suffered a fair amount of economic malaise due to the decline in the steel-making capacity in the region.

'''Coatesville''' is a city in [[Chester County, Pennsylvania|Chester County]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[United States]]. The population was 13,100 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. Coatesville is approximately 39 miles west of [[Philadelphia]].

Coatesville grew up around the [[Lukens Steel Company]]. Lukens was bought by the [[Bethlehem Steel]] Corporation in 1997. In 2002, Bethlehem was bought by the then Ohio-based [[International Steel Group]] (ISG). Later, [[Mittal Steel]] bought ISG and then merged with Arcelor Steel to form the [[ArcelorMittal]] company.

==History==

===Beginnings===
The first known settlement in the area which would be known as Coatesville was a Native American village built along the [[Christina River|West Branch of the Brandywine River]]. This settlement was a post for fur trading with the earliest American settlers. The Brandywine River features prominently in the history of Coatesville.

William Fleming, originally from [[Scotland]], is one of the earliest landowners on record. He built a log cabin in the area of Harmony Street and 5th Avenue and owned about {{convert|207|acre|km2}} of land bordering the Brandywine River.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Mowday, Bruce Edward. ''Images of America: Coatesville''. Charleston, SC: Arcadia, 2003. pp 7-8. ISBN 0-7385-1198-6.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Moses Coates, a prosperous farmer and the namesake of Coatesville, bought the Fleming house from Fleming's son in 1787. Moses Coates' son-in-law, Jesse Kersey, came up with a plan to develop the area by selling frontage on the recently completed [[Lancaster Turnpike]] which crossed through their land. The Lancaster Turnpike was the first toll road in the U.S., authorized in 1792 and completed in 1795.  There was a tollgate located within the present day Coatesville city limits.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.coatesville.org/visitors/history.asp City of Coatesville website]&lt;/ref&gt; Coatesville became a popular stopping point since it was located roughly halfway between [[Philadelphia]] and [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]] on the Turnpike.

Another of the earliest settlers in the Coatesville region was [[Pierre Bizallion]]. He was a French fur trader who settled in the area in the early 18th century, and was said to have been an interpreter between [[William Penn]] and the Native Americans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~pacheste/chester_twplist_caln_1881his.htm Chester Co PA; Caln; 1881 HISTORY&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The Veterans Administration Hospital now sits on a piece of the roughly {{convert|500|acre|km2}} of land that was once owned by Bizallion.

===19th century===
Before Coatesville became the only city in Chester County, it was a town called Bridge-Town, because of the two bridges that were used to cross the Brandywine River.  A village named &quot;Midway&quot;, named after its station owned by the [[Philadelphia and Columbia Railroad]] midway between Philadelphia and Lancaster, was also formed in 1834&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; on the western bank of the Brandywine. The village of Midway and the village of Bridge-Town merged to become the borough of Coatesville in 1867. Coatesville citizens voted to become a city in 1915.

Coatesville was able to capitalize on the natural energy available due to the Brandywine River running through the area. Jesse Kersey, Moses Coates' son-in-law, partnered with the ironmaster [[Isaac Pennock]] and purchased over {{convert|110|acre|km2}} of Moses Coates' farm along both sides of the Brandywine River in 1810. The resulting company was named the [[Brandywine Iron Works and Nail Factory]], the forerunner of [[Lukens Steel Company|Lukens Steel]]. Charles Lukens, MD, married Isaac Pennock's daughter Rebecca in 1813. Following her husband's death in 1825, [[Rebecca Lukens]] took over the operations of the mill, purchasing it from her mother and seeing it through turmoil and market panic into a prosperous mill. Rebecca was one of the first female operators of a major corporation in America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.steelmuseum.org/rebecca.htm National Steel Heritage Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century===
As Lukens Steel grew so did Coatesville, eventually becoming known as the &quot;[[Pittsburgh]] of the East.&quot;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;  By the beginning of the 20th century the population had grown to 6,000.  Along with the growth, the school system expanded as well as the religious community.  In 1932 Coatesville was the home to 22 churches and Chester County's only synagogue, [[Beth Israel Congregation of Chester County|Beth Israel Congregation]]. Lukens Steel was the largest employer in Chester County in the 1960s, with over 10,000 workers. After [[World War II]] the steel industry began a long decline and Lukens Steel was eventually sold again and again, forcing workplace reductions to 5,000 and eventually to 2,000.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

In 1911, the [[lynching]] in Coatesville of Zachariah Walker, a black man who allegedly killed a white mill policeman [http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=41259720 Edgar Rice], prompted the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) to investigate and called for an end to lynching nationwide. Walker was dragged from a hospital, still chained to his bedstead, and burned to death in front of hundreds of Coatesville citizens in a field south of the city. When Walker staggered from the pyre, a mass of flames, with rakes and pitchforks the citizens of Coatesville shoved him back in.  The lynching was the last in Pennsylvania and is said to have left a permanent stain on the city's image.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

===21st century===

Coatesville recently began an ambitious redevelopment project which include tearing down abandoned and dangerous [[public housing]], building new [[single family home|single family]] and [[townhouse]] developments, a regional recreation center, and most recently, [[mixed-use development|mixed use]] projects that would include retail, office, and condominium housing, as well as the renovation of the local [[Amtrak]] station which has fallen into disrepair. A new Marriott hotel built along Route 82 on the outskirts of Coatesville opened May 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailylocal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20120504/NEWS01/120509721/marriott-courtyard-opens-in-coatesville |title=Marriott Courtyard opens in Coatesville |last1=Smith |first1=Eric S. |date=May 5, 2012 |work=Daily Local News (Chester Co., PA) |publisher=dailylocal.com |accessdate=2012-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The redevelopment plans have not been without controversy,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailylocal.com/articles/2008/02/20/past%20stories/19956696.txt Authority, council seek to close rift - dailylocal.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; including a five-year [[eminent domain]] dispute with a local landowner in neighboring [[Valley Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania|Valley Township]]. It has been resolved without the need to seize the property, but it caused the ouster of four incumbent city councilpersons in the November 2005 general elections.  The four new councilpersons, two of whom are ordained [[Pentecostal]] and [[Methodist]] ministers, caused further controversy with the firing of the city solicitor, the resignation of the city manager (who negotiated with the Valley Township landowner), and the departure of the assistant manager, police chief, and city treasurer.

The word &quot;Altoona&quot; is a derivative of the Latin word ''altus'', meaning &quot;high&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Gannett |first= Henry |authorlink= Henry Gannett |title= The origin of certain place names in the United States |year= 1905 |publisher= [[United States Government Printing Office|Government Printing Office]] |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=BqwPAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA22 |page= 22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This explanation for the naming of Altoona is contradicted by Pennsylvania Place Names.&lt;ref&gt;Espenshade, A. Howry: Pennsylvania Place Names, Page 175-176.  Genealogical Publishing Co, Inc., Baltimore, Maryland, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;
Although Altoona, in Blair Country, is popularly known as &quot;the Mountain City,&quot; its name has no direct or indirect etymological relation to the Latin adjective altus, signifying &quot;elevated, lofty.&quot; Two very different explanations of the origin of this name are current.  The one which seems to be most natural and reasonable runs as follows:
&quot;The locomotive engineer who ran the first train into Altoona in 1851 was Robert Steele, who died several years ago, aged nearly ninety years.  He was then the oldest continuous resident of the city. He was much respected, and had long been one of the private pensioners of Andrew Carnegie. Mr. Steele is authority for the statement that Colonel Beverly Mayer, of Columbia, Pennsylvania, who, as a civil engineer of what was then the Pennsylvania Central Railway, had laid out the tracks in the yards of the newly projected city, named the place Altoona after the city of Altona in Schleswig-Holstein, which became part of Germany in 1862.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}
The [[Altona, Hamburg|German Altona]], which lies on the right bank of the Elbe immediately west of [[Hamburg]], is an important railway and manufacturing centre with a population of nearly 200,000. The etymological derivation of the name Altona is not known with certainty, but widely believed to be Low German ''all to na'', meaning &quot;all too near&quot; (sc. Hamburg).{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

The popular explanation derives the name of Altoona from Allatoona, said to be a Cherokee Indian name. In 1849 David Robinson sold his farm to Archibald Wright of Philadelphia, who transferred the property to his son, John A. Wright, who laid it out in building lots, became one of the founders of Altoona, and was responsible for the naming of the town. According to his own statement, he had spent considerable time in the Cherokee country of Georgia, where he had been especially attracted by the beautiful name of Allatoona, which he had bestowed upon the new town in the belief that it was a Cherokee word meaning &quot;the high lands of great worth.&quot; In the Cherokee language there is a word eladuni, which means &quot;high lands,&quot; or &quot;where it is high&quot;; but to a Cherokee, Allatoona and eladuni are so different that the former could hardly be derived from the latter.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

An older history dated 1883 &lt;ref&gt;Africa, J. Simpson: History of Huntingdon and Blair Counties, Pennsylvania, page 135. J. B. Lippincott &amp; Co. Philadelphia, 1883.&lt;/ref&gt; favored the Cherokee derivation, stating that &quot;Its name is not derived from the Latin word altus nor from the French word alto, as has frequently been asserted and published, but from the beautiful, liquid, and expressive Cherokee word allatoona. This is on the authority of the person who bestowed the name, Mr. Wright, of Philadelphia, who was long a resident of the Cherokee country in Georgia, and an admirer of the musical names of that Indian language.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

===Growth===
The town grew rapidly in the late 19th century, its population approximately 2,000 in 1854, 10,000 in 1870, and 20,000 in 1880. The demand for [[locomotive]]s during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] stimulated much of this growth, and by the later years of the war Altoona was known as a valuable city for the North. It was considered by [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] General [[Robert E. Lee]] as a target during the [[Army of Northern Virginia]]'s mid-1863 entry into Pennsylvania, before being repelled at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]]. Also notable is the Union's Loyal [[War Governors' Conference]], held at Altoona's [[War Governors' Conference|Logan House Hotel]], which politically backed [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s recently released [[Emancipation Proclamation]] following Union victory at the [[Battle of Antietam]] in September 1862. Altoona was also the site of the first Interstate Commission meeting to create and design the [[Gettysburg National Cemetery]] following the devastating [[Battle of Gettysburg]]. The centrality and convenience of the town's rail transportation was what brought these two important gatherings to the city during the war.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

====Horseshoe Curve====

[[Horseshoe Curve (Pennsylvania)|Horseshoe Curve]], a curved section of track built by the PRR, has become a [[tourism|tourist]] attraction and [[National Historic Landmark]]. The curve was used to raise trains to a sufficient elevation to cross the Allegheny Ridge to the west. The Allegheny Ridge had been a major barrier and construction of the [[Erie Canal]] in New York twenty years earlier already had diverted much port traffic which had used Philadelphia to New York City instead, causing the rise of that city's commercial dominance. Because the curve was an industrial link to the western U.S., Horseshoe Curve was a primary target of eight [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[saboteurs]] who had infiltrated the U.S. during [[World War II]] by being dropped off by [[U-boat]]s of the German Navy (''[[Kriegsmarine]]'') during [[Operation Pastorius]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}
[[Image:Altoona map.png|right|thumb|200px|Map of Altoona and surrounding areas]]

In the early 20th century, PRR's [[Altoona Works]] complex employed, at its peak, approximately 15,000 people and covered three miles (5&amp;nbsp;km) in length, {{convert|218|acre}} of yards and {{convert|37|acre}} of indoor workshop floor space in 122 buildings. The PRR built many of its own locomotives at the Works, some 7,873 in all, the last being constructed in 1946.&lt;ref name=NPS/&gt; PRR had significant influence on the city, creating the city's fire departments and relocating the hospital to a site nearer to the shop's gates. Today, the [[Altoona, Pennsylvania#Fire|fire department]] employs 65 personnel and is the largest career department between Harrisburg and Pittsburgh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.altoonafirefighters.org|title=Altoona Firefighters Local 299|accessdate=2007-09-22| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070928021223/http://www.altoonafirefighters.org/| archivedate= 28 September 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; PRR sponsored a city band and constructed Cricket Field (a sports complex). In 1853, the PRR built the Mechanic's Library, the first industrial library in the nation which exists today as the Altoona Public Library.&lt;ref name=&quot;Historical Society of Pennsylvania&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsp.org/default.aspx?id=477|title=Historical Society of Pennsylvania}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the decline in railroad demand after [[World War II]], things began to decline. Many historic treasures of the city's history disappeared, including the Logan House Hotel and railroad shops.&lt;ref name=NPS&gt;{{cite web |title = History of the Altoona Railroad Shops: The Creation And Coming Of The Pennsylvania Railroad |work = National Park Service Special History Study |publisher = United States National Park Service |date = 2004-10-22 |url = http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/railroad/shs1.htm |accessdate = 2007-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current===
Altoona is one of the dual seats of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Altoona-Johnstown]]. The [[Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament (Altoona)|Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament]] was made a [[cathedral]] and rechristened from St. John's Church in 1851.

The ''[[Altoona Mirror]]'' newspaper,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.altoonamirror.com/|title=Altoona Mirror|accessdate=2007-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; founded in 1876 by Harry Slep, is Altoona's oldest media outlet. Today, the newspaper has a daily circulation of 32,000 and a Sunday circulation of 39,000. Approximately 13,000 people read the online edition of the newspaper each day.

Altoona serves as the corporate home to [[Sheetz]], a rapidly growing [[convenience store]] chain in the [[United States]]. It now has 429 locations throughout Pennsylvania, Virginia, Maryland, West Virginia, Ohio and North Carolina.

Altoona is home to the world's oldest wooden roller coaster, the [[Leap the Dips]], located in [[Lakemont Park]].

==Geography==
Altoona lies at the base of [[Brush Mountain (Blair County, Pennsylvania)|Brush Mountain]] within Logan Valley and Pleasant Valley. According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;9.8&amp;nbsp;sq&amp;nbsp;mi&amp;nbsp;(25.3&amp;nbsp;km²)&lt;/span&gt;, all land. Altoona is situated in the [[Allegheny Mountains]].

Altoona is located at {{coord|40|30|39|N|78|23|59|W}} (40.510720, &amp;minus;78.399758).{{GR|1}}

===Adjacent municipalities===
There are several townships outside of Altoona city limits that, although autonomous, use the name Altoona for postal and name-place designation. They include the townships of: [[Logan Township, Blair County, Pennsylvania|Logan Township]] and [[Tyrone Township, Blair County, Pennsylvania|Tyrone Township]], as well as small parts of [[Allegheny Township, Blair County, Pennsylvania|Allegheny Township]] and [[Frankstown Township, Blair County, Pennsylvania|Frankstown Township]].

==Sections==
[[Image:Altoona City Sections V2.jpg|right|thumb|400px|Map of Altoona Neighborhoods]] The main sections of Altoona are the [[Downtown Altoona, Pennsylvania|Downtown]], Center City, Logantown, Fairview, Juniata, Wehnwood, Calvert Hills, 5th Ward, Westmont, Eldorado, East End, Dutch Hill, Pleasant Valley, Hileman Heights, 6th Ward, Mansion Park, Llyswen, Garden Heights, and Highland Park. Some significant neighborhoods are: Little Italy, Gospel Hill, Toy Town, Columbia Park, Knickerbockers, and Curtin. Some areas within Logan Township are not within the defined City limits but still considered sections of Altoona, including:  Lakemont, Greenwood, Bellmeade, Westfall, Newburg, and Red Hill. Many of the older districts consist of a mix of [[Terraced house|rowhomes]] and individual homes, which were a common building style in railroad towns so-as to provide for worker and manager housing, respectively.

[[Image:Altoona Downtown from 5th Ward.jpg|right|thumb|400px|A view of downtown Altoona from a 5th Ward hill]]

===Downtown===
The downtown is the cultural and commercial center of Altoona and straddles the famous railroads. As is typical to a traditional city layout, the downtown is centrally located and contains significant development in all directions from the downtown. Much of the downtown area is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as the [[Downtown Altoona Historic District]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com/PA/Blair/districts.html|title=National Register of Historic Places - Blair County}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popular landmarks include the [[Mishler Theatre]], the [[Penn Alto Building]] (formerly the Penn Alto Hotel), the Gable's Building, City Hall, the [[Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament (Altoona)|Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament]], and Eleventh Avenue itself.

Altoona is notable for having several churches, such as the [[Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament (Altoona)|Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament]] at the corner of 13th Street and 13th Avenue, the [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] church on the corner of 12th Street and 14th Avenue, and the First [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] Church on the corner of 14th Street and 12th Avenue. The Station Medical Center, formerly known as the Station Mall, was a downtown mall built during the 1970s in place of many old railroad shops. The downtown contains most of what's known as Altoona's [[Little Italy]] district.

Because of the geography of the area, exact or natural boundaries for Downtown are not present. Therefore Downtown is generally defined by what the City has zoned as Central Business: between 13th Ave and the PRR Expressway, and from 7th Street to 16th Street. However it is common for areas within Logantown and Center City to be expressed locally as &quot;downtown.&quot;

The [[Texas Wiener|Texas Hot Dog]] was originally created in downtown Altoona in 1918, although the [[Paterson, New Jersey]] Texas Hot Dog location, which opened in 1924, is more famous.

====Architecture====
The commercial core of the downtown includes many multistory residential, commercial, and mixed-use facilities designed in at the turn-of-the-20th-century in a mix of [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]], [[Edwardian Baroque architecture|Edwardian Baroque]], and [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Neo-Romanesque]] styles. This style features high ceilings, resulting in taller buildings than is typical for the number of floors. The high ceilings are typically made of either [[Tin ceiling|tin]] or [[plaster]], although sometimes a [[Dropped ceiling|drop ceiling]] is utilized.

Individual homes originally provided housing to managers and executives of the PRR and have structural similarities to Victorian or Edwardian mansions, but built very narrow and tall. These are sometimes used as double or triple family apartments or even converted into commercial space. Outside of the commercial core is a mosaic of multistory commercial structures, mixed use facilities, single story commercial structures, apartment buildings, multi-unit housing, and single-family homes.

====Industry====
As typical of many [[Manufacturing Belt|rust belt]] cities, the economic downturn of the railroad resulted in the closure of many of the downtown's landmark stores and industries; and the simultaneous rise in prominence of the [[automobile]] shifted commercial development to the suburbs. However, through recent revitalization efforts, Altoona's downtown maintains a significant level of economic vitality and hosts few office and residential vacancies.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} The downtown maintains a significant focus on [[Walkability|pedestrian-oriented development]], as evidenced by the presence of more pedestrian bridges and underpasses across the railroad tracks (connecting the two parts of downtown) than automobile crossings.

Penn State Altoona has bought several downtown buildings, including the former Playhouse Theater building, the six-story Penn Furniture building, and the former [[WRTA (AM)|WRTA]] building. The University has turned them into the Devorris Downtown Center, the Aaron Building and the Kazmaier Family Building. Recently [[Sheetz]] has added another building to Penn State Altoona called The Sheetz Center for Entrepreneurial Excellence on the former site of a department store behind the Amtrak Station. The University provides a flow of resources into the downtown, aiding in revitalization efforts. As an example of the university's value to the downtown's economy, the installation of the Blue Lot near the Wolf Court Building has improved the economic attraction of downtown by offering up to three hours of free parking. A bike path connecting the Campus to Downtown Altoona has also been built.

===Center City===
Center City comprises industrial and commercial zones as well as urban and multiple household residential zones. Often, the Center City, Little Italy, and Gospel Hill areas (as well as Lower Fairview) are included as part of &quot;downtown&quot; for tourism and promotional purposes, much like how the Strip District in Pittsburgh is promoted. This is due to both the proximity and the fact that the buildings from these sections are similar to downtown buildings and blend in with the skyline. On the west side of the tracks, Center City extends around Downtown 2-3 blocks with heavy residential, industrial and commercial to the north, south and west. The eastern side of the tracks, which according to the public maps is called &quot;East Side,&quot; runs along the length of the tracks from 1st Street to 23rd street and from the tracks to 6th Avenue west to east. However, the [[Altoona Area High School]] is considered Center City despite standing on the Dutch Hill side of 6th Avenue. The East Side of Center City is home to the High School and Junior High, the former Roosevelt Junior High School, the [[Railroaders Memorial Museum|Altoona Railroaders Museum]], [[Boyer Brothers|Boyer Candies]], the Station Medical Center of Altoona Regional Health System, as well as many current and old railroad facilities.

====Little Italy and Gospel Hill====
The neighborhood area known as Little Italy is the neighborhood between 7th Street and 12th Street north to south and 9th Ave to 6th Ave west to east, sometimes this is extended to include the Station Medical Center. Gospel Hill is the neighborhood in the area of 15th Street and 16th Ave and adjacent to the park of the same name.

===Logantown===
Logantown is the area just north of the Downtown and is considered a direct extension of Downtown. It borders Fairview along 16th Ave, Willow Ave and Cherry Ave to the north, 13th Ave and Chestnut Ave to the south, and Juniata Gap Road to the east. This is where [[UPMC Altoona]] is located, which is the tallest building in Altoona at 14 Floors. This is also where Cricket Field used to be located. Logantown is zoned as a mix of commercial and residential, and contains some of the oldest houses built in Altoona that are still standing.
[[Image:Altoona Fairview1.jpg|right|thumb|400px|Fairview]]

===Fairview===
Fairview is a mostly residential area North and West of Downtown and Logantown. It borders Calvert Hills to the south at 12th Street, Downtown and Logantown to the east along 16th Ave and Willow Ave and then along Cherry Ave after 5th Street, and borders Juniata Gap Road to the north. Fairview is zoned as multiple household residential in the areas directly bordering Downtown, and transitions to single household residential after 21st Avenue, and eventually to suburban after 24th Ave. Many houses in the part of downtown near Fairview and lower Fairview are the middle-density mansions originally owned by managers and executives of the PRR. The most striking example of this is the Penn Alto residential hotel on the corner of 13th Avenue and 12th Street, which has two single-unit houses next to it. Conversely, there are several multistory residential and commercial buildings on 17th Avenue.  One of the sections of the downtown is called &quot;Lower Fairview&quot; due to its transitionary nature. The houses between 14th and 15th avenues (with two commercial buildings included) on 12th street are designed based on an architectural pattern used in Philadelphia's urban neighborhoods.

===Dutch Hill===
Dutch Hill district contains an abundance of historic neighborhoods and traditional &quot;corner markets&quot;. This section gets its name from the abundance of Germans who moved into this area when the City was still expanding. Dutch Hill is the area that borders the City Center to the East and is zoned as multiple household residential. The boundaries are generally considered 4th Street to 17th Street north to south, and 6th Avenue to Walton Avenue from west to east. However as the [[Altoona Area High School]] and Junior High are considered City Center, the border is around 4th Ave (or 3rd Ave if the entire school zone is included) when between 11th Street and 17th Street.

===Juniata===
Juniata is defined as north of Juniata Gap Road, east of East 25th Ave and on the west side of the railroad line. The area is zoned as mostly residential limited, but also uniquely has a significant area of light and heavy industrial as well as a central business area. This is because Juniata was once its own city, and was incorporated into Altoona in the late 19th century. Because of this, the section's street names had conflicting numbers with the rest of the City, and had to be given a North prefix. The commercial area is sometimes nicknamed &quot;downtown Juniata.&quot; The most important street in Juniata's L-shaped commercial district is North Fourth Avenue. The [[J.L. Noble School]] was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1996.&lt;ref name=&quot;nris&quot;&gt;{{NRISref|version=2010a}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original Thompson's Pharmacy was on 2nd Street in Juniata before moving a few blocks to a larger main store and branching out to become a small, local chain.

===East End===
The East End is defined as the area on the east side of the railroad line north of 4th Street. It is called the East End because it borders the north end of the tracks where trains would depart east towards Philadelphia. Because of this, most streets have an East prefix. The East End is mostly single household residential and suburban, but has small areas of residential-commercial and neighborhood business along Kettle Street and Lloyd Street, as well as highway business along Pleasant Valley Blvd.

===Pleasant Valley===
Pleasant Valley is the area that centers around Pleasant Valley Boulevard, which is a massive stretch of highway business that runs the entire length of Altoona. The Sheetz store known locally as &quot;Supersheetz&quot; is located here along 17th Street and was the first of its kind ever built. The area is defined as southeast of Walton Ave and extends from 1st Street til 22nd Street and defined by Polk Ave to the east. As well as the large highway business area, Pleasant Valley also has an even amount of single household residential and suburban along with some small stretches of residential commercial and urban.

===Eldorado===
Eldorado (pronounced locally as &quot;El-doe-ray-doe&quot;) is the southern section of Altoona, south of Logan Boulevard and west of 6th Avenue as well as a small section south of 57th Street all the way to Rhode Island Avenue (Goods Lane) in the east. Eldorado is zoned as almost entirely suburban, with small areas of light industrial and neighborhood business. The [[Sheetz]] Headquarters is located in this area. At one time, this section was also known as the &quot;West End&quot; because trains leaving the south end of town head west towards Pittsburgh. Some parts of Eldorado are actually outside of incorporated Altoona and located in [[Allegheny Township, Blair County, Pennsylvania|Allegheny Township]] and [[Logan Township, Blair County, Pennsylvania|Logan Township]].

====Toy Town====
Toy Town is the neighborhood in between 31st and 33rd Streets and centered around Race Street.

===Lakemont===
Lakemont is located southeast of Garden Heights between Frankstown Road and Logan Boulevard. While residing within Logan Township just outside of the official border of the City and designated as the &quot;Village of Lakemont,&quot; it is commonly accepted as a section of Altoona. In fact, [[Peoples Natural Gas Field]] the home of the [[Altoona Curve]] resides in Lakemont. Also in Lakemont is [[Lakemont Park]] and Galactic Ice. Lakemont is zoned as single household residential, residential commercial and highway business.

===Greenwood===
Greenwood is the area north of the East End and begins around a block north of Grant Street. While mostly residing within Logan Township just outside of the official border of the City and designated as the &quot;Village of Greenwood,&quot; it is commonly accepted as a section of Altoona, especially since a 3 block by 4 block zone lies within the city limits. Greenwood is zoned almost entirely as suburban with a section of highway business along Route 220. Greenwood Road is a lone exception with a more urban residential zoning. [[Ward Trucking]]'s headquarters are located in this section of Altoona.

===Wehnwood===
Wehnwood is the area west of 25th Ave between Wehnwood Road to the north and 1st St to the south. This is part of where [[Penn State Altoona]] is located. Wehnwood is mostly zoned as suburban or single residential with an area of neighborhood business along 25th Ave and Juniata Gap Road. There is a fair amount of student housing surrounding the campus, and therefore a small pocket of urban residential next to it.

===Mansion Park===
Mansion Park gets its name from the famous historical [[Baker Mansion]] which stands in this area. There are several streets surrounding the old plantation where mansions built in the early 20th century still stand. Mansion Park Stadium is also located here, which is the 10,000 seat stadium where the Altoona Mountain Lions play. The Mansion Park area is located east of 6th Ave, with Logan Blvd and Ward Ave to the south, 27th Street to the north and a block past Union Ave to the east.

====Columbia Park====
Columbia Park is the neighborhood adjacent to Tuckahoe Park between 6th Ave and Union Ave with Crescent Road to the south. The area is single and suburban residential.
[[File:Altoona Knickerbocker.JPG|right|thumb|400px|The Knickerbocker and Tavern]]

===Highland Park===
Highland Park is the area south of Logan Blvd, east of 6th Ave, north of 57th Street and west of Ruskin Drive. The name comes from the hill that the area is centered on is the only significant highland in southern Altoona. The actual Highland Park is located on top of the hill.

==Transportation==
Altoona is a major center on the [[Norfolk Southern Railway]]'s (NS) Pittsburgh Line. In Altoona, helper engines are added to heavy trains to give them extra power up and over Horseshoe Curve west of town. The [[Altoona Works|Juniata]] Heavy Repair Shop Complex, originally built by the PRR, is the primary repair and maintenance facility on NS. On an average day, 60-80 trains pass though Altoona. The historical importance to the railroad industry and the current high level of railroad activity has made Altoona a mecca for [[railfan]]s for over 60 years, with the Railroaders Memorial Museum and the Horseshoe Curve being popular spots.

[[Amtrak]]'s ''[[Pennsylvanian (Amtrak)|Pennsylvanian]]'' stops at [[Altoona Transportation Center|Altoona station]] once daily in each direction.

Local bus service in the city is provided by [[AMTRAN (Altoona Transit)|AMTRAN]]. In 2007, AMTRAN customers suffered a major loss in service due to cuts in state funding. In May of that year, [[Ed Rendell|Governor Rendell]] visited Altoona to discuss plans intended to rectify this situation.

Roadway service primarily consists of [[Interstate 99]], which provides access to the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]] to the south and [[Interstate 80 in Pennsylvania|Interstate 80]] to the north; and [[U.S. Route 22]], which provides east-west service and direct access to [[Pittsburgh]] and [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]]. Local roadways in Altoona tend to be given numerical names, and ''Streets'' are aligned northwest-southeast and ''Avenues'' are aligned northeast-southwest.

The [[Altoona-Blair County Airport]] provides commercial air service for Altoona, offering daily flights to [[Washington Dulles International Airport]].

==Economy==
Historically, the sole economic force driving the growth of Altoona into a City was the Pennsylvania Railroad. While the various local railroad shops still employ over a thousand people, they are no longer the driving economic engine of the area.

The top field of employment in Altoona and the metro area is healthcare. Facilities include: Altoona Regional Health System with its many local facilities that employ thousands, Healthsouth Rehabilitation Hospital and its several local facilities, Van Zandt Medical Center (Veterans Hospital), dozens of doctors offices, and over 20 nursing homes and assisted living facilities.

Another massive employer is retail and service industries. Altoona is the linchpin of Tri-City Region. Its location along I-99 draws from a large trade area over a wide geographic area that extends to State College and Johnstown and over {{convert|40|mi|km}} south along I-99 past I-70.  Altoona draws the most retail customers in the region due to its centralized location and to the fact that it has the best complimentary retail of the three markets with {{convert|2800000|sqft|m2}} of retail space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.logantowncentre.net/Centre_overview.htm |title=Shopping Centre Overview |publisher=Logantowncentre.net |date= |accessdate=2012-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scale and diversity of retail within the City of Altoona and the surrounding area is not paralleled within the region. The areas of retail include:
* Downtown (including Little Italy)
* The 17th Street corridor including what remains of the Station Mall.
* Certain large zoned sections along Logan Blvd and 6th Ave.
* The [[Logan Valley Mall]] which is a major retail staple of the area.
* Essentially the entire length of about {{convert|3.5|mi|km}} of Pleasant Valley Blvd and Valley View Blvd as they converge into Plank Road, consisting of numerous stores and shopping centers. This area plus Route 764 which runs through Altoona and the northern and southern suburbs is known as the &quot;Green Banana&quot;.
* The Walmart and Target shopping centers.
* The Logan Town Centre which is the newest and arguably the best and most diverse shopping center that sits directly next to I-99.
* As well as several more plazas and centers just to the North and South of the city as well as the western suburbs of Cresson and Galitzin.

Altoona is the home of the [[Sheetz]] headquarters. Sheetz is one of the largest convenience store and gas station chains in the country, with stores in Pennsylvania, Maryland, Ohio, West Virginia, Virginia, and North Carolina. Because of this, approximately 20 Sheetz stores&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sheetz.com/main/locations/searchByState.cfm |title=Sheetz® Official Site :: Find a Sheetz Near You! |publisher=Sheetz.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; are located in and around Altoona.

==Emergency Services==

Altoona and the Altoona Area are serviced by several companies for emergency services. Given that Altoona is entirely encompassed by Logan Township, and some small areas within the city are belonging to the Township, City and Township services often intermingle. Given the close proximity to Hollidaysburg and Duncansville Boroughs as well as Allegheny and Blair Townships, City, borough and township services will often assist or be called in place of each other. 

===Police===

The Altoona Police Department (APD) services the City. APD is about 67 strong, and the precinct is located on 12th Ave downtown.

Logan Township Police Department services all areas of Logan Township. However, since the Township encompasses the City, in order to be centrally located the precinct is located in the City on 7th Ave. LTPD is 16 strong.

===Fire===

[[File:Altoona AFD Station4.JPG|right|thumb|400px|Altoona Fire Department Station 4 and Engine 314]]
The Altoona Fire Department (AFD) supplies fire and [[Quick Response Service]] (QRS) to the City, as well as [[Haz-Mat]] response for Blair County. The Department is also a part of the [[International Association of Firefighters|IAFF]], local 299. The AFD is composed of 64 line personnel, over 4 &quot;tricks&quot; (a.k.a. shifts), A, B, C, and D. Each shift works two 10-hour daylight shifts, then two 14-hour night shifts, followed by four days off. Within the city, there are five firehouses, four of which are manned. The fifth station is the old AMED (Altoona's Ambulance Service building) located across from AFD Headquarters.

The department operates under the number 300. Like all county fire apparatus, the city still follows the standard unit numbering to distinguish [[fire engines]] from ladder trucks to fire chiefs. The AFD has 21 pieces of apparatus that service the residents of Altoona. Amongst these pieces of equipment are manned and reserve apparatus. At all times, the city maintains 4 engines, 1 ladder truck, 1 heavy-rescue truck, plus an assistant chief on duty. Also, all 4 main engines carry the AMKUS [[Jaws of Life]] equipment.

The four stations are located throughout the city. Headquarters at Station 1 (310) is at 1319 Washington Avenue. This is where the department chief, deputy chief, and assistant chief are housed. Station 2 is located on N. 2nd Street and N. 6th Avenue in Juniata. Station 3 is located on Crawford Avenue and 6th Street in Pleasant Valley. Station 4, in Eldorado, is on 6th Avenue and Burgoon Road.

Logan Township United just north of Juniata, Allegheny Township just south of Eldorado, Newburg just north of Westfall, Greenwood, Pinecroft, and Lakemont. The only time that both the AFD and a surrounding volunteer company will respond together on calls is for [[motor vehicle accidents]] on [[I-99]].

In the early 20th century, the Pennsylvania Railroad constructed a large sports complex at the intersection of Chestnut Avenue and Seventh Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rootsweb.com/~pablair/place.html|title=RootsWeb Blair place names}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was named Cricket Field in an attempt to appeal to [[Cricket]]-loving [[United Kingdom|British]] [[investor]]s. Cricket did not catch on with the Altoona populace, so its close relative baseball became the choice for Cricket Field. Well known baseball players as [[Babe Ruth]] and [[Josh Gibson]] played at Cricket Field, and the stadium was also the venue for numerous other sporting events, musical competitions, marching units, and activities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Historical Society of Pennsylvania&quot; /&gt; A plaza stands today on the site of Cricket Field.

Altoona was the site of a {{convert|1.25|mi|km|adj=on}} [[board track racing|board track]] called Altoona Speedway from 1923 to 1931.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.motorsportmemorial.org/focus.php?db=ct&amp;n=139 Motorsport Memorial: Ray Keech], Retrieved July 24, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mansion Park Stadium===

[[Altoona Area School District]]'s Mansion Park Stadium has long been recognized as one of the finest athletic complexes in Pennsylvania. The stadium, which has a seating capacity of 10,400, is a source of community pride and regularly serves as the site of a variety of events which benefit the economy of the Altoona-Blair County area.

In the summer of 2009, Sports Construction Group, LLC installed “Trophy Turf,” which has a 48-ounce face weight and inlaid football and soccer lines.

Mansion Park's first artificial surface was installed in 1989. Omniturf provided a way to maximize the use of the facility throughout the year and at the same time, save taxpayer dollars through reduced maintenance costs. AstroTurf 12-2000 was installed in 1999. The eight-lane polyurethane running track was installed in 1989 and has been resurfaced several times.

For 22 consecutive seasons, the playing surface has received rave reviews from players and coaches as athletes have experienced controlled footing regardless of the weather conditions. Most importantly, there has been a significant decrease in serious injuries since the artificial turf was installed.

During a typical fall season, more than 60 events take place on the turf. [[Altoona Area High School|Altoona High]] varsity and junior varsity teams, [[Altoona Area School District#Altoona Area Junior High School|Altoona Area Junior High School]] ninth grade teams, and [[Bishop Guilfoyle High School]] all play home football games at Mansion Park. The stadium is also the site of AAHS boys and girls soccer matches and countless practice sessions. District and interdistrict football and soccer playoffs are held each year at Mansion Park, the home of the PIAA Football Championships from 1992 through 1997. The Pennsylvania Scholastic Football Coaches Association East West High School All Star Game was played at Mansion Park from 2001-2010.

Numerous high school and junior high school track meets, including the District 6 Class AA and AAA championships and the West Central Coaches Meet, are held at the stadium each spring. The track is also used extensively on a daily basis by hundreds of community residents who enjoy walking and jogging.

Mansion Park has also been the site of a 1992 [[Pittsburgh]] [[Pittsburgh Steelers|Steeler]] intrasquad scrimmage, the Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference men's and women's college soccer championships, [[University of Pittsburgh]] preseason football practices and the 1995 PIAA Soccer Championships.

Music events have also been well received. Appearances by the [[Beach Boys]], [[Up With People]], the United States Marine Drum and Bugle Corps, the [[Penn State]] [[Blue Band]], the [[Ohio State]] Pride of the Buckeyes Band, the [[University of Notre Dame]] [[Band of the Fighting Irish]], the [[University of Illinois]] [[Marching Illini]] and the [[Indiana University of Pennsylvania]] Marching Band have attracted huge crowds. Drum Corps International competitions were held in 1998 and again in 2000.

Altoona Area High School's Commencement is scheduled at the stadium each year. Mansion Park is also the home of the [[American Cancer Society]]'s [[Relay for Life]].

In early 2010, a new scoreboard featuring a video display board with an improved stadium sound system was erected thanks to the generosity of local sponsors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aasdcat.com/aasd/district/campus/mansionpark.html |title=Altoona Area School District, Altoona PA |publisher=Aasdcat.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==

Altoona has an education system that contains three high schools, two parochial, one public. [[Bishop Guilfoyle High School]] is one of the private parochial school having grades 9-12, located at 2400 Pleasant Valley. Blvd. Great Commission Schools is the second private parochial school having grades K-12, located at 1100 6th Ave. [[Altoona Area High School]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.aasdcat.com/aasd |title= Altoona Area School District|accessdate=2007-09-22| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070928211510/http://www.aasdcat.com/aasd| archivedate= 28 September 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; houses grades 10-12, and is located at 1415 6th Ave. Altoona High is much larger than Bishop Guilfoyle, graduating around 600 students annually, while Guilfoyle graduates around 100. Most athletic teams at Bishop Guilfoyle are the smallest classification within the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association (PIAA), which is Class single A. In contrast, those at Altoona Area High School are the largest classification within the PIAA, which is AAAA. These high schools occasionally compete against each other in basketball, volleyball, tennis, cross country and softball.

It also contained two junior high schools, named D.S. Keith Junior High and Theodore Roosevelt Junior High, but both closed and merged in 2008 to become the [[Altoona Area School District#Altoona Area Junior High School|Altoona Area Junior High School]].  Roosevelt was torn down and the ground on which it stood was constructed into the new field for the new junior high. Keith, however, was turned into residential apartments.

Altoona is also home to [[The Pennsylvania State University]], Ivyside Park campus, also known as [[Penn State Altoona]]. This is the third largest of the [[Pennsylvania State University Commonwealth Campus|Penn State Commonwealth Campuses]]. The college has approximately 4,182 students as of the 2009-10 school year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://budget.psu.edu/FactBook/StudentDynamic/EnrollmentFallToFallComparison.aspx?SemesterCodes=200809FA200910FA&amp;FBPlusIndc=N |title=Penn State Fact Book |publisher=Budget.psu.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Altoona also is home to several technical schools. The Greater Altoona Career and Technology Center (GACTC) is located on 16th Street next to the high school and offers a variety of technical classes for both Junior High and High School students throughout Blair County, as well as high school graduates seeking a technical degree. [[YTI Career Institute]] has a campus in Logan Hills on Fairway Drive. South Hills Business School has a campus located on 58th Street.

'''Sharon''' is a city in [[Mercer County, Pennsylvania|Mercer County]], [[Pennsylvania]], in the [[United States]], {{convert|75|mi|km}} northwest of [[Pittsburgh]]. It is part of the [[Youngstown, Ohio|Youngstown]]&amp;ndash;[[Warren, Ohio|Warren]]&amp;ndash;[[Boardman, Ohio|Boardman]], [[Ohio|OH]]-PA [[Youngstown-Warren-Boardman, OH-PA Metropolitan Area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]]. 

== History ==
Sharon was settled in 1795, incorporated as a [[borough]] on October 6, 1841, and incorporated as a city on December 17, 1918.  The city operated under the PA third-class city charter until 2008, at which point it adopted a home rule charter under which the elected position of mayor was replaced with a hired city manager and financial officer.

The founding families of Sharon first settled on a flat plain bordering the [[Shenango River]] (this area is situated between two hills and is the current location of Sharon's downtown business district). According to local legend, the community received its name from a Bible-reading settler who likened the location to the [[Plain of Sharon]] in [[Israel]].

Initially a center of coal mining, Sharon's economy transitioned to steelmaking and other heavy industry following the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Following the extensive national [[deindustrialization]] of the 1970s and 80's, the city's economy diversified and is now based primarily on light industry, education, health care, and social services.

The [[Frank H. Buhl Mansion]] was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1977.&lt;ref name=&quot;nris&quot;&gt;{{NRISref|version=2010a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sharon is the home of [[Quaker Steak &amp; Lube]] and [[Vocal Group Hall of Fame|The Vocal Group Hall of Fame]].

== Geography ==
Sharon is located at {{coord|41|13|48|N|80|29|56|W|type:city}} (41.230106, -80.498960){{GR|1}} in southwest Mercer County, the city borders the city of [[Hermitage, Pennsylvania|Hermitage]] to the north and east, the city of [[Farrell, Pennsylvania|Farrell]] to the south, and on the west the [[census-designated places]] of [[Masury, Ohio|Masury]] and [[West Hill, Ohio]].

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|3.8|sqmi|km2}}, all land. However, the [[Shenango River]] runs through the city and provides drinking water to Sharon and several surrounding communities.

==History==
Native tribes in the area of what is now Lebanon included the [[Shawnee]], [[Susquehannock]], [[Gawanese]], [[Lenape]] (or Delaware), and [[Nanticoke people]]s.&lt;ref name=lestz&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/19990203143240/http://www.willowvalley.com/wvlancasterinfo.htm A Brief History of Lancaster County]. Web.archive.org (1999-02-03). Retrieved on 2013-07-27.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lebanon was then settled in 1720 by European colonists, many with the family names of &quot;Steitz&quot; and &quot;Light&quot;, along a creek that was then named &quot;Steitz Creek&quot;. The Light patriarchs built a fort to protect against Indians and named it &quot;Light's Fort&quot; during this time. The town was laid out in 1753. The town was incorporated as a [[borough]] on February 20, 1821 and became a city on November 25, 1885. It adopted the commission form of government, consisting of four councilmen and a mayor.  
In 1900, 17,628 people lived in Lebanon; in 1910, 19,240 people lived there; in 1920, 24,643 people lived there; and in 1940, 27,206 people lived in Lebanon, Pennsylvania.

[[Lebanon bologna]] was first made here. Lebanon was formerly home to a major [[steel mill]] operated by [[Bethlehem Steel]].

==Culture==
[[Image:LebanonBolognaDrop2008.jpg|thumb|Lebanon's 12&amp;nbsp;ft, 150&amp;nbsp;pound New Year's Eve bologna]]
Lebanon is one of several Pennsylvania towns to drop or raise a unique item at midnight on New Year's Eve. Godshall's Quality Meats, owners of Weaver's Famous Lebanon Bologna, donates a huge ({{convert|150|lb|kg|adj=on}}) Lebanon bologna for the annual festivity. It is encased in a metal frame and suspended from a fire department ladder truck, and donated to a local rescue mission after the celebration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whtm.com/news/stories/1207/484193.html WHT.com news story]&lt;/ref&gt; 

An infamous 1878 murder in [[Fort Indiantown Gap]] resulted in a trial of six defendants who all had blue eyes. They were given the moniker ''[[Blue Eyed Six|the Blue-eyed Six]]'' by a newspaper reporter who attended the trial, held in the Lebanon county courthouse. Five of the six defendants were hanged at the county jail. The trial received worldwide publicity and provided inspiration to [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] in writing the [[Sherlock Holmes]] short story ''[[The Adventure of the Red-Headed League]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig, Gary (1979). The Blue Eyed Six, A Historical Narrative. Lebanon, PA: Hodge Podge USA.&lt;/ref&gt;

At one point in history the Lebanon County courthouse and jail became the home of the Lebanon Farmers Market. However, the popular farmers market returned to the original 30,000 square foot Market House location on South 8th street in 2003. This popular indoor market includes vendors such as Candy Rama, Keener Poultry, The Pretzel Twist and TTT Star Sushi. In addition to the vendors, customers can sit down and dine upstairs in Niko's Restaurant. 

In December 2008, the TV show ''[[Dirty Jobs]]'', hosted by [[Mike Rowe]], visited the Seltzer's Smokehouse Meats to film production of Lebanon bologna.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Later,{{When|date=January 2011}} the show featured the Wertz Candy Shop.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tv.com/dirty-jobs/fuel-tank-cleaner/episode/955684/recap.html TV.com episode recap]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2010, an [[independent film]] drama ''Lebanon, PA'' was made.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lebanonpamovie.com/]&lt;/ref&gt; While the movie was set in Lebanon, all filming was done in other parts of Pennsylvania.

Lebanon, Pennsylvania, is named after the ancient [[Middle East|Middle Eastern]] nation of [[Lebanon]], which is commonly pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ɛ|b|ə|n|ɒ|n}}, rhyming with the name &quot;John.&quot; However, locals consistently pronounce the Pennsylvania city's name {{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ɛ|b|ə|n|ən}} (&quot;Leb-a-''nin''&quot;) and many shorten it to two syllables—&quot;Leb-nin&quot; or even &quot;Lep-nin.&quot; The latter is particularly identified with [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] heritage. &lt;ref&gt;http://dailyapple.blogspot.com/2007/08/apple-260-wilkes-barre-pa.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Harrisburg played a notable role in American history during the [[Frontier|Westward Migration]], the [[American Civil War]], and the [[Industrial Revolution]]. During part of the 19th century, the building of the [[Pennsylvania Main Line of Public Works|Pennsylvania Canal]] and later the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] allowed Harrisburg to become one of the most industrialized cities in the [[Northeastern United States]]. The [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] ship [[USS Harrisburg|USS ''Harrisburg'']], which served from 1918 to 1919 at the end of World War I, was named in honor of the city.

In the mid-to-late 20th century, the city's economic fortunes fluctuated with its major industries consisting of government, [[Heavy industry|heavy manufacturing]] including the production of [[steel]], [[agriculture]] (the greater Harrisburg area is at the heart of the fertile [[Pennsylvania Dutch Country]]), and food services (nearby [[Hershey, Pennsylvania|Hershey]] is home of the [[The Hershey Company|chocolate maker]], located just {{convert|10|mi|km}} east of Harrisburg). In 1981, following contractions in the steel and [[dairy]] industries, Harrisburg was declared the second most distressed city in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.calea.org/online/newsletter/no73/case_number_23.htm Case Number 23, Harrisburg, PA] Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies.

==History==
{{Main|History of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania}}{{See also|Timeline of Harrisburg history}}

===Founding===
Harrisburg's site along the [[Susquehanna River]] is thought to have been inhabited by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] as early as 3000 BC. Known to the Native Americans as &quot;Peixtin&quot;, or &quot;[[Paxtang, Pennsylvania|Paxtang]]&quot;, the area was an important resting place and crossroads for Native American traders, as the trails leading from the Delaware to the Ohio rivers, and from the Potomac to the Upper Susquehanna intersected there. The first European contact with Native Americans in Pennsylvania was made by the Englishman, [[John Smith of Jamestown|Captain John Smith]], who journeyed from [[Virginia]] up the Susquehanna River in 1608 and visited with the [[Susquehannock|Susquehanna]] tribe. In 1719, [[John Harris, Sr.]], an English trader, settled here and 14 years later secured grants of {{convert|800|acre|km2}} in this vicinity. In 1785, [[John Harris, Jr.]] made plans to lay out a town on his father's land, which he named Harrisburg. In the spring of 1785, the town was formally surveyed by [[William Maclay (politician)|William Maclay]], who was a son-in-law of John Harris, Sr. In 1791, Harrisburg became incorporated and was named the Pennsylvania state capital in October 1812, and has been since.
The assembling here of the Harrisburg Convention in 1827 led to the passage of the high [[Tariff of 1828|protective-tariff bill]] of 1828. In 1839, [[William Henry Harrison|Harrison]] and [[John Tyler|Tyler]] were nominated for [[President of the United States]] at the first [[1839 Whig National Convention|national convention]] of the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] of the United States, which was held in Harrisburg.

===Pre-industry 1800-1850===
Before Harrisburg gained its first industries, it was a scenic, pastoral town, typical of most of the day: compact and surrounded by farmland. In 1822, the impressive brick capitol building was completed for $200,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gilbert, Stephanie Patterson|url=http://www.old8thward.com/pdf/PattersonGilbertweb.pdf |title=Harrisburg’s Old Eight Ward: Constructing a Website for Student Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was Harrisburg’s strategic location which gave it an advantage over many other towns.  It was settled as a trading post in 1719 at a location important to Westward expansion.  The importance of the location was that it was at a pass in a mountain ridge.  The Susquehanna River flowed generally west to east at this location, providing a route for boat traffic from the east.  The head of navigation was a short distance northwest of the town, where the river flowed through the pass.  Persons arriving from the east by boat had to exit at Harrisburg and prepare for an overland journey westward through the mountain pass.  Harrisburg assumed importance as a provisioning stop at this point where westward bound pioneers transitioned from river travel to overland travel.  It was partly because of its strategic location that the state legislature selected the small town of Harrisburg to become the State Capitol in 1812.

The grandeur of the Colonial Revival capitol building dominated the quaint town. The streets were dirt, but orderly and platted in grid pattern.  The Pennsylvania Canal was built in 1834 and coursed the length of the town. The residential houses were situated on only a few city blocks stretching southward from the capitol building. They were mostly one story. No factories were present but there were blacksmith shops and other businesses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eggert, Gerald G. 1993. p58&quot;&gt;Eggert, Gerald G., Harrisburg Industrializes: The Coming of Factories to an American Community. University Park, PA: The Pennsylvania State University Press, 1993. p58&lt;/ref&gt;

===American Civil War===
{{Main|Harrisburg in the American Civil War}}
During the [[American Civil War]], Harrisburg was a significant training center for the [[Union Army]], with tens of thousands of troops passing through [[Camp Curtin]]. It was also a major rail center for the Union and a vital link between the Atlantic coast and the Midwest, with several railroads running through the city and spanning the Susquehanna River. As a result of this importance, it was a target of [[General]] [[Robert E. Lee]]'s [[Army of Northern Virginia]] during its two invasions. The first time during the 1862 [[Maryland Campaign]], when Lee planned to capture the city after taking [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia]], but was prevented from doing so by the [[Battle of Antietam]] and his subsequent retreat back into Virginia. The second attempt was made during the [[Gettysburg Campaign]] in 1863 and was more substantial. A short skirmish took place in June 1863 at [[Camp Hill, Pennsylvania|Sporting Hill]], just 2&amp;nbsp;miles west of Harrisburg. This is considered by many to have been the northern-most battle of the Civil War.
During the first part of the 19th century, Harrisburg was a notable stopping place along the [[Underground Railroad]], as escaped [[History of slavery in the United States|slaves]] would be transported across the Susquehanna River and were often fed and given supplies before heading north towards Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://alpha.dickinson.edu/departments/hist/NEHworkshops/NEH/resource/ugrrDocs.htm#harrisburg The Underground Railroad]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industrial rise 1850-1920===
[[File:Hb market street.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Postcard depicting Market Street in [[Downtown Harrisburg]] as it appeared in 1910. [[Tram|Trolley]] tracks are noticeable along the street.]]
Harrisburg’s importance in the latter half of the 19th century was in the steel industry.  It was an important railroad center as well. [[Iron and steel industry|Steel and iron]] became dominant industries. Steel and other industries continued to play a major role in the local economy throughout the latter part of the 19th century. The city was the center of enormous railroad traffic and its steel industry supported large furnaces, rolling mills, and machine shops. The Pennsylvania Steel Company plant, which opened in nearby [[Steelton, Pennsylvania|Steelton]] in 1866, was the first in the country; later operated by [[Bethlehem Steel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.steeltonpa.com/history.asp|title=History of Steelton, PA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its first large scale iron foundries were put into operation shortly after 1850.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eggert, Gerald G. 1993. p58&quot;/&gt;
As industries nationwide entered a phase of great expansion and technological improvement, so did industries – and in particular the steel industry - in Harrisburg.  This can be attributed to a combination of factors that were typical of what existed in other successful industrial cities: rapid rail expansion; nearby markets for goods; and nearby sources for raw product.
With Harrisburg poised for growth in steel production, The borough of Steelton became the ideal location for this type of industry.  It was a wide swath of flat land located south of the city, with rail and canal access running its entire 4 mile length.  There was plenty of room for houses and its own downtown section. Steelton was a company town, opened in 1866 by the Pennsylvania Steel Company.  Highly innovative in its steel making process, it became the first mill in the United States to make steel railroad rails by contract.  In its heyday Steelton was home to more than 16,000 residents from 33 different ethnic groups.  All were employed in the steel industry, or had employment in services that supported it.  In the late 19th century, no less than five major steel mills and foundries were located in Steelton. Each contained a maze of buildings; conveyances for moving the products; large yards for laying down equipment; and facilities for loading their product on trains. Stacks from these factories constantly belched smoke. With housing and a small downtown area within walking distance, these were the sights and smells that most Steelton residents saw every day.

The rail yard was another area of Harrisburg that saw rapid and thorough change during the years of industrialization. This was a wide expanse of about two dozen railroad tracks that grew from the single track of the early 1850s.  By the late 19th century, this area was the width of about two city blocks and formed what amounted to a barrier along the eastern edge of the city: passable only by bridge.  Three large and ornately embellished passenger depots were built by as many rail lines.  Pennsylvania Railroad was the largest rail line in Harrisburg.  It built huge repair facilities and two large roundhouses in the 1860s and 1870s to handle its enormous freight and passenger traffic and to maintain its colossal infrastructure.  Its rails ran the length of Harrisburg, along its eastern border.   It had a succession of three passenger depots, each built on the site of the predecessor, and each of high style architecture, including a train shed to protect passengers from inclement weather.  At its peak in 1904, it made 100 passenger stops per day.  It extended westward to Pittsburgh; across the entire state.  It also went eastward to Philadelphia, serving Steelton in route. The vital anthracite coal mines in the Allegheny Mountains were reached by the Northern Central Railroad.  The Lebanon Valley Railroad extended eastward to Philadelphia with spurs to New York City.  Another rail line was the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad which provided service to Philadelphia and other points east.&lt;ref&gt;Eggert, Gerald G., Harrisburg Industrializes: The Coming of Factories to an American Community. University Park, PA: The Pennsylvania State University Press, 1993. p40&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industrial decline 1920-70===
The decades between 1920 and 1970 were characterized by industrial decline and population shift from the city to the suburbs. Like most other cities which faced a loss of their industrial base, Harrisburg shifted to a service-oriented base, with industries such as health care and convention centers playing a big role. Harrisburg’s greatest problem was a shrinking city population after 1950.  This loss in population followed a national trend and was a delayed result of the decline of Harrisburg’s steel industry. This decline began almost imperceptibly in the late 1880s, but did not become evident until the early 20th century.

After being held in place for about 5 years by WWII armament production, the population peaked shortly after the war, but then took a long-overdue dive as people fled from the city.  Hastening the flight to the suburbs were the cheap and available houses being built away from the crime and deteriorating situation of the city. The reduction in city population coincided with the rise in population of the Metropolitan Statistical Area. The trend continued until the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Eggert, Gerald G., Harrisburg Industrializes: The Coming of Factories to an American Community. University Park, PA: The Pennsylvania State University Press, 1993. p339&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beginning of Harrisburg's suburbs: 1980s===

The gradual loss of industry, especially after WWII, coupled with the proliferation of the street car and later the automobile, led to urban flight to the suburbs.  Allison Hill was Harrisburg’s first suburb. It was located east of the city on a prominent bluff, accessed by bridges across a wide swath of train tracks.  It was developed in the late 19th century and offered affluent Harrisburgers the opportunity to live in the suburbs only a few hundred yards from their jobs in the City.  Easy access was achieved via the State Street Bridge leading east from the Capitol complex and the Market Street Bridge leading from the City’s prominent business district.  In 1886 a single horse trolley line was established from the city to Allison Hill.  The most desirable section of Allison Hill was Mount Pleasant, which was characterized by large Colonial Revival style houses with yards for the very wealthy and smaller but still well-built row houses lining the main street for the moderately wealthy. State Street, leading from the Capitol directly toward Allison Hill, was planned to provide a grand view of the Capitol dome for those approaching the City from Allison Hill. This trend towards outlying residential areas began slowly in the late 19th century and was largely confined to the trolley line, but the growth of automobile ownership quickened the trend and spread out the population.

===Early to late 20th century===
[[File:Anti-nuke rally in Harrisburg USA.jpg|thumb|right|170px|[[Anti-nuclear]] protest at Harrisburg in 1979, following the [[Three Mile Island accident]].]]
In the early 20th century, several Harrisburg residents became involved in the [[City Beautiful movement]].  Mira Lloyd Dock and Horace McFarland advocated urban improvements which were influenced by European urban planning design and the [[World's Columbian Exposition]].  Specifically, their efforts greatly enlarged the Harrisburg park system, creating Riverfront Park, Reservoir Park, the Italian Lake and Wildwood Park.  In addition, schemes were undertaken for the burial of electric wires, the creation of a modern sanitary sewer system, and the beautification of an expanded [[Pennsylvania State Capitol Complex|Capitol complex]].

The [[Pennsylvania Farm Show]], the largest indoor agriculture exposition in the United States, was first held in 1917 and has been held every January since then. The present location of the Show is the [[Pennsylvania State Farm Show Arena]], located at the corner of Maclay and [[Cameron Street|Cameron]] streets.

In June 1972, Harrisburg was hit by a major flood from the remnants of hurricane [[Hurricane Agnes|Agnes]].

On March 28, 1979, the [[Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station|Three Mile Island]] nuclear plant, along the [[Susquehanna River]] located in Londonderry Township which is south of Harrisburg, suffered a partial meltdown. Although the meltdown was contained and radiation leakages were minimal, there were still worries that an evacuation would be necessary. Governor [[Dick Thornburgh]], on the advice of [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] Chairman [[Joseph Hendrie]], advised the evacuation &quot;of pregnant women and pre-school age children ... within a five-mile radius of the Three Mile Island facility.&quot; Within days, 140,000 people had left the area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/tmi/stories/decade032889.htm A Decade Later, TMI's Legacy Is Mistrust] ''The Washington Post'', March 28, 1989, p. A01.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stephen R. Reed]] was elected mayor in 1981 and served until 2009, making him the city's longest serving mayor. In an effort to end the city's long period of economic troubles, he initiated several projects to attract new business and tourism to the city. Several museums and hotels such as [[Whitaker Center for Science and the Arts]], the [[National Civil War Museum]] and the [[Hilton Hotels|Hilton Harrisburg and Towers]] were built during his term, along with many office buildings and residential structures. Several semi-professional sports franchises, including the [[Harrisburg Senators]] of the [[Eastern League (U.S. baseball)|Eastern League]], the defunct [[Harrisburg Heat]] indoor soccer club and the [[Harrisburg City Islanders]] of the [[USL Second Division]] began operations in the city during his tenure as mayor. While praised for the vast number of economic improvements, Reed has also been criticized for population loss and mounting debt. For example, during a budget crisis the city was forced to sell $8 million worth of Western and American-Indian artifacts collected by Mayor Reed for a never-realized museum celebrating the [[American West]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.pennlive.com/patriotnews/2007/05/160151-harrisburgs_western_artifacts.html|title=Harrisburg rounds up Western artifacts for auction - The Patriot News - Brief Article (May 2007)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===21st century fiscal difficulties and receivership===
[[File:Harrisburg PA from airplane.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view of Harrisburg]]
Missing audits, convoluted transactions, including swap agreements make it difficult to state how much debt the city owes. Some estimates put total debt over $1.5 billion which would mean that every resident would owe $30,285.&lt;ref name=Harrisdebt&gt;{{cite news|last=Malawskey|first=Nick|title=Harrisburg's eye-popping debt|url=http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2012/05/harrisburgs_eye-popping_debt_t.html | accessdate=June 2012|newspaper=[[The Patriot-News]]|date=May 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These numbers do not reflect the school system deficit nor the school district's $437 million long term debt,&lt;ref name = &quot;school&quot;&gt;{{cite news |author=Emily Previti |coauthors= |title=Harrisburg officials considering tax incentives for 10 city properties|url=http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2013/08/harrisburg_officials_consideri.html |quote= |work=[[The Patriot-News]] |date=August 28, 2013 |accessdate=2013-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; nor unfunded pension and healthcare obligations.

The heart of the city’s financial woes is the trash to electricity plant, the Harrisburg incinerator that was supposed to generate income but instead, because of increased borrowing, has a debt of $320 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Corkery|first=Michael|title=The Incinerator That Kept Burning Cash|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903532804576564882240033792.html|accessdate=June 2012|newspaper=WSJ|date=September 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city is divided into numerous neighborhoods and districts. Like many of Pennsylvania's cities and [[borough]]s that are at &quot;build-out&quot; stage, there are several townships outside of Harrisburg city limits that, although autonomous, use the name ''Harrisburg'' for postal and name-place designation. They include the townships of: [[Lower Paxton Township, Pennsylvania|Lower Paxton]], [[Middle Paxton Township, Pennsylvania|Middle Paxton]], [[Susquehanna Township, Dauphin County, Pennsylvania|Susquehanna]], [[Swatara Township, Dauphin County, Pennsylvania|Swatara]] and [[West Hanover Township, Pennsylvania|West Hanover]] in Dauphin County.

===Culture===
[[File:Market Square in Harrisburg.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Harrisburg's [[Market Square, Harrisburg|Market Square]]. Formerly the site of a market in [[Downtown Harrisburg]], today it is a public transport hub and commercial center.]]
[[File:Kunkel Building Nov 10.JPG|thumb|right|170px|The Kunkel Building, built in 1913, was home to the [[Susquehanna Art Museum]] until December 2010.]]
Downtown Harrisburg has two major performance centers. The [[Whitaker Center for Science and the Arts]], which was completed in 1999, is the first center of its type in the United States where education, science and the [[performing arts]] take place under one roof. The Forum, a 1,763-seat concert and lecture hall built in 1930-31, is a state-owned and operated facility located within the [[Pennsylvania State Capitol Complex|State Capitol Complex]]. Since 1931, The Forum has been home to the [[Harrisburg Symphony Orchestra]].

Beginning in 2001, downtown Harrisburg saw a surge of commercial nightlife development. This has been credited with reversing the city's financial decline, and has made downtown Harrisburg a destination for events from jazz festivals to Top-40 nightclubs.

Harrisburg is also the home of the annual [[Pennsylvania Farm Show]], the largest [[Agricultural show|agricultural exhibition]] of its kind in the nation. Farmers from all over Pennsylvania come to show their animals and participate in competitions. Livestock are on display for people to interact with and view. In 2004, Harrisburg hosted [[CowParade]], an international public [[art exhibit]] that has been featured in major cities all over the world. Fiberglass sculptures of cows are decorated by local artists, and distributed over the city centre, in public places such as train stations and parks. They often feature artwork and designs specific to local culture, as well as city life and other relevant themes.

There were 24,314 housing units at an average density of 2,997.9 per square mile (1,157.5/km²). The racial makeup of the city was 54.83% [[African American (U.S. Census)|Black]] or [[Race (United States Census)|African American]], 31.72% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 0.37% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 2.83% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], 0.07% [[Pacific Islander (U.S. Census)|Pacific Islander]], 6.54% from other races, and 3.64% from two or more races. 11.69% of the population were [[Hispanics in the United States|Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]] of any race. Harrisburg is the 6th most populous city in eastern Pennsylvania.

About 23.4% of families and 24.6% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 34.9% of those under age 18 and 16.6% of those age 65 or over.

The very first census taken in the United States occurred in 1790. At that time Harrisburg was a small, but substantial [[Colonial history of the United States of America|colonial]] town with a population of 875 residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0027.html|title=Population of the 100 Largest Cities 1790 to 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the increase of the city's prominence as an industrial and transportation center, Harrisburg reached its peak population build up in 1950, topping out at nearly 90,000 residents. Since the 1950s, Harrisburg, along with other northeastern urban centers large and small, has experienced a declining population that is ultimately fueling the growth of its [[suburbs]], although the decline - which was very rapid in the 1960s and 1970s - has slowed considerably since the 1980s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eggert&quot;&gt;&quot;Harrisburg Industrializes, The coming of factories to an American community&quot;, Eggert, Gerald G.; The Pennsylvania State University Press, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike [[Sun Belt|Western and Southern states]], Pennsylvania maintains a complex system of municipalities and has very little legislation on either the annexation/expansion of cities or the consolidating of municipal entities.

Reversing fifty years of decline, 2007 Census Bureau estimates show that Harrisburg's population has actually grown. Between 2006 and 2007, Harrisburg gained 22 people. In 2009 the urban population of the Harrisburg area increased to 383,008 from 362,782 in 2000, a change of 20,226 people.&lt;ref name=&quot;urbanpop&quot;&gt;[http://proximityone.com/urbanpopulation.htm America's Urban Population: Patterns &amp; Characteristics 2000-2009] Proximity, 2009 data, Retrieved January 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the Harrisburg area was listed with [[Lebanon, Pennsylvania|Lebanon]] and [[York, Pennsylvania|York]] as an urban agglomeration, or a contiguous area of continuously developed urban land,&lt;ref name=&quot;urbanpop2&quot;&gt;[http://proximityone.com/urbanagglomerations.htm America's Urban Agglomerations 2010] Proximity, Retrieved January 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; signifying a future merger of the York-[[Hanover, Pennsylvania|Hanover]] and [[Harrisburg metropolitan area]]s, which would create a metropolitan area of over 1 million.

===Media===
The Harrisburg area has two daily newspapers. [[The Patriot-News]] is published in Harrisburg and has a tri weekly circulation of over 100,000. [[The Sentinel (Pennsylvania)|The Sentinel]], which is published in Carlisle, roughly 20&amp;nbsp;miles west of Harrisburg, serves many of Harrisburg's western suburbs in [[Cumberland County, Pennsylvania|Cumberland County]]. The [[Press and Journal (Pennsylvania)|Press and Journal]], published in Middletown, is one of many weekly, general information newspapers in the Harrisburg area. Harrisburg has several monthly community newspapers, including MODE Magazine (publishing since 1996), Urban Connection, and TheBurg. There are also numerous television and radio stations in the Harrisburg/[[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]]/[[York, Pennsylvania|York]] area, which makes up the 39th largest media market in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvjobs.com/cgi-bin/markets/market2.cgi Nielsen Media 2009-2010 Local Market Estimates.] Accessed January 30, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Only one non-municipal portal website exists for the city of Harrisburg, HarrisburgPA.com.

==Sports==
{{Main|Sports in South Central Pennsylvania}}
Harrisburg serves as the hub of professional sports in [[South Central Pennsylvania]]. A host of teams compete in the region including three professional baseball teams, the [[Harrisburg Senators]], the [[Lancaster Barnstormers]], and the [[York Revolution]].  The Senators are the oldest team of the three, with the current incarnation playing since 1987. The original Harrisburg Senators began playing in the [[Eastern League (baseball)|Eastern League]] in 1924.  Playing its home games at [[City Island (Pennsylvania)|Island Field]], the team won the league championship in the 1927, 1928, and 1931 seasons.  The Senators played a few more seasons before flood waters destroyed Island Field in 1936, effectively ending Eastern League participation for fifty-one years.  In 1940, Harrisburg gained an Interstate League team affiliated with the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]]; however, the team remained in the city only until 1943, when it moved to nearby [[York, Pennsylvania|York]] and renamed the [[York Pirates]].  The current Harrisburg Senators, affiliated with the [[Washington Nationals]], have won the Eastern League championship in the 1987, 1993, 1996, 1997, 1998, and 1999 seasons.

==Government==

===City of Harrisburg===
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:Pa state cap 2.gif|thumb|200px|right|State Capitol and adjacent government complex - from overhead.]] --&gt;
{{Main|List of mayors of Harrisburg|Harrisburg City Council}}
Dr. [[Martin Luther King, Jr]]. City Government Center, the only city hall in the United States named for a [[American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)|civil rights]] leader, serves as a central location for the administrative functions of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harrisburgpa.gov/visitors/centerCity/centralBusiness3.html|title=Central Business District overview}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Harrisburg has been served since 1970 by the &quot;[[Mayor-council government|strong mayor]]&quot; form of municipal government, with separate executive and legislative branches. The Mayor serves a four-year term with no term limits. As the full-time chief executive, the Mayor oversees the operation of 34 agencies, run by department and office heads, some of whom comprise the Mayor's cabinet, including the Departments of Public Safety (police and fire bureaus), Public Works, Business Administration, Parks and Recreation, Incineration and Steam Generation, Building &amp; Housing Development and Solicitor. The city has 721 employees (2003).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.city-data.com/us-cities/The-Northeast/Harrisburg-Municipal-Government.html|title=Harrisburg:Municipal Government}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current mayor of Harrisburg is [[Linda D. Thompson]], whose term expires January 2014.

There are seven [[Harrisburg City Council|city council]] members, all elected at large, who serve part-time for four-year terms. There are two other elected city posts, [[City Treasurer|city treasurer]] and [[Comptroller|city controller]], who separately head their own fiscally related offices. The current city controller is [[Daniel C. Miller]], whose term expires in January 2014.

====Property tax reform====
Harrisburg is also known nationally for its use of a two tiered [[Land value tax in the United States|land value taxation]]. Harrisburg has [[Land value tax|taxed land]] at a rate six times that on improvements since 1975, and this policy has been credited by its former mayor, [[Stephen R. Reed]], as well as by the city's former [[city manager]] during the 1980s with reducing the number of [[Abandonment|vacant structures]] located in [[downtown Harrisburg]] from about 4,200 in 1982 to fewer than 500 in 1995.&lt;ref name=&quot;earth&quot;&gt;[http://www.earthrights.net/docs/success.html Pennsylvania's Success with Local Property Tax Reform: The Split Rate Tax] Earth Rights Institute. Hartzok, Alanna. 1995. Accessed February 12, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; During this same period of time between 1982 and 1995, nearly 4,700 more city residents became employed, the crime rate dropped 22.5% and the fire rate dropped 51%.&lt;ref name=&quot;earth&quot; /&gt;

Harrisburg, as well as nearly 20 other [[Pennsylvania]] cities, employs a ''two-rate'' or ''split-rate'' [[property tax]], which requires the taxing of the value of land at a higher rate and the value of the buildings and improvements at a lower one. This can be seen as a compromise between pure LVT and an ordinary property tax falling on real estate (land value plus improvement value).&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, M. - ''Why So Little Georgism in America: Using the Pennsylvania Case Files to Understand the Slow, Uneven Progress of Land Value Taxation''. Lincoln Institute of Land Policy (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, two-rate taxation may be seen as a form that allows gradual transformation of the traditional real estate property tax into a pure land value tax.

Nearly two dozen local Pennsylvania jurisdictions, such as Harrisburg,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcommonwealth.org/news/lvt-jurisdiction-rates |title= PA two-rate cities and rates as of Nov. 2009 |publisher=The Henry George Foundation of America|accessdate=2010-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; use two-rate property taxation in which the tax on land value is higher and the tax on improvement value is lower. In 2000, Florenz Plassmann and [[Nicolaus Tideman]] wrote&lt;ref name=&quot;markovchain&quot;&gt;&quot;A Markov Chain Monte Carlo Analysis of the Effect of Two-Rate Property Taxes on Construction&quot;, Journal of Urban Economics, 2000, vol. 47, issue 2, p. 216-247&lt;/ref&gt; that when comparing Pennsylvania cities using a higher tax rate on land value and a lower rate on improvements with similar sized Pennsylvania cities using the same rate on land and improvements, the higher land value taxation leads to increased construction within the jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;Oates, W. &amp; Schwab, R. &quot;The Impact of Urban Land Taxation: The Pittsburgh Experience.&quot; National Tax Journal L (March) 1-21. (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cord, S. &quot;Taxing Land More Than Buildings: The Record In Pennsylvania.&quot; In C. Lowell Harriss, ed. 1983. The Property Tax and Local Finance. New York: The Academy of Political Science 172-179.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dauphin County Government Complex, in [[Central Business District (Downtown Harrisburg)|downtown]] Harrisburg, serves the administrative functions of the county. The [[trial court]] of general jurisdiction for Harrisburg rests with the [[Dauphin County, Pennsylvania|Court of Dauphin County]] and is largely funded and operated by county resources and employees.

===Commonwealth of Pennsylvania===
{{Main|Government of Pennsylvania}}
{{See also|List of Pennsylvania state agencies}}
The [[Pennsylvania State Capitol Complex]] dominates the city's stature as a regional and national hub for government and politics. All administrative functions of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania are located within the complex and at various nearby locations.

The Commonwealth Judicial Center houses Pennsylvania's three [[appellate courts]], which are located in Harrisburg. The [[Supreme Court of Pennsylvania]], which is the court of last resort in the state, hears arguments in Harrisburg as well as Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. The [[Superior Court of Pennsylvania]] and the [[Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania]] are located here. Judges for these courts are elected at large.

===Federal government===
The [[Ronald Reagan Federal Building and Courthouse (Pennsylvania)|Ronald Reagan Federal Building and Courthouse]], located in downtown Harrisburg, serves as the regional administrative offices of the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]]. A branch of the [[U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania]] is also located within the courthouse. Due to Harrisburg's prominence as the state capital, federal offices for nearly every agency are located within the city.

The [[United States Armed Forces|United States military]] has a strong historic presence in the region. A large retired military population resides in [[South Central Pennsylvania]] and the region is home to a large [[United States National Cemetery|national cemetery]] at [[Indiantown Gap National Cemetery|Indiantown Gap]]. The federal government, including the military, is the top employer in the [[Harrisburg metropolitan area|metropolitan area]].

==Transport==

===Airports===
Domestic and International airlines provide services via [[Harrisburg International Airport]] (MDT), which is located southeast of the city in [[Middletown, Dauphin County, Pennsylvania|Middletown]]. HIA is the third-busiest commercial [[airport]] in Pennsylvania, both in terms of passengers served and cargo shipments.&lt;ref name=&quot;trans&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.harrisburgpa.gov/econProfile/transport.html| year=2006| title=Transport in the Harrisburg area|first=| last=City of Harrisburg| publisher=harrisburgpa.gov/| accessdate = 2007-01-03}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Passenger carriers that serve HIA include [[US Airways]], [[United Airlines]], [[Delta Air Lines]], [[Air Canada]], and [[Frontier Airlines]]. [[Capital City Airport (Pennsylvania)|Capital City Airport]] (CXY), a moderate-sized business class and [[general aviation]] airport, is located across the Susquehanna River in the nearby suburb of [[New Cumberland, Pennsylvania|New Cumberland]], south of Harrisburg. Both airports are owned and operated by the [[Susquehanna Area Regional Airport Authority]] (SARAA), which also manages the [[Franklin County Regional Airport]] in [[Chambersburg, Pennsylvania|Chambersburg]] and [[Gettysburg Regional Airport]] in [[Gettysburg, Pennsylvania|Gettysburg]].

===Public transit===
Harrisburg is served by [[Capital Area Transit (Harrisburg)|Capital Area Transit]] (CAT) which provides [[bus|public bus]], [[paratransit]], and [[CorridorOne|commuter rail]] service throughout the greater metropolitan area. Construction of a commuter rail line designated the [[Capital Red Rose Corridor]] (previously named CorridorOne) will eventually link the city with nearby [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtptransit.org/assets/pdf/Legislative%20Update%206%20-%2008%20Cap%20Red%20Rose.pdf New Name Unveiled for Harrisburg to Lancaster Proposed Rail Service] Modern Transit Partnership, accessed February 5, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;{{update after|2011|1}}

Long-term plans for the region call for the commuter rail line to continue westward to [[Cumberland County, Pennsylvania|Cumberland County]], ending at [[Carlisle, Pennsylvania|Carlisle]]. In early 2005, the project hit a roadblock when the Cumberland County [[County commission|commissioners]] opposed the plan to extend commuter rail to the West Shore. Due to lack of support from the county commissioners, the Cumberland County portion, and the two new stations in Harrisburg have been removed from the project. In the future, with support from Cumberland County, the commuter rail project may extend to both shores of the [[Susquehanna River]], where the majority of the commuting base for the [[Harrisburg metropolitan area]] resides.&lt;ref name=&quot;tcrpc&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.tcrpc-pa.org/SRTP/SRTP_Chapter_05/corridorone.htm| year=2006| title=CorridorOne in the Harrisburg Region|first=| last=| publisher=Tri-County Regional Planning Commission| accessdate = 2007-01-24 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070101164656/http://www.tcrpc-pa.org/SRTP/SRTP_Chapter_05/corridorone.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, a second phase of the rail project designated CorridorTwo was announced to the general public. It will link [[Downtown Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|downtown]] Harrisburg with its eastern suburbs in [[Dauphin County, Pennsylvania|Dauphin]] and [[Lebanon County, Pennsylvania|Lebanon]] counties, including the areas of [[Hummelstown, Pennsylvania|Hummelstown]], [[Hershey, Pennsylvania|Hershey]] and [[Lebanon, Pennsylvania|Lebanon]], and the city of [[York, Pennsylvania|York]] in [[York County, Pennsylvania|York County]].&lt;ref name=&quot;tcrpc&quot;/&gt; Future passenger rail corridors also include [[US Route 15|Route 15]] from the Harrisburg area towards [[Gettysburg, Pennsylvania|Gettysburg]], as well as the Susquehanna River communities north of Harrisburg, and the Northern [[Susquehanna River|Susquehanna Valley]] region.&lt;ref name=&quot;tcrpc&quot;/&gt;

===Intercity bus service===
The lower level of the Harrisburg Transport Center serves as the city's intercity [[Bus station|bus terminal]]. Daily bus services are provided by [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]], [[Trailways Transportation System|Bieber Tourways]], [[Trailways Transportation System|Capitol Trailways]], Fullington Trailways, and Susquehanna Trailways. They connect Harrisburg to other Pennsylvania cities such as [[Allentown, Pennsylvania|Allentown]], Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, [[Reading, Pennsylvania|Reading]], [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]], [[State College, Pennsylvania|State College]], [[Williamsport, Pennsylvania|Williamsport]], and [[York, Pennsylvania|York]] and nearby, out-of-state cities such as [[Baltimore]], [[Binghamton, New York|Binghamton]], New York, [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], and Washington, D.C., plus many other destinations via transfers.&lt;ref name=&quot;hbg_trans&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.tcrpc-pa.org/SRTP/SRTP_Chapter_02/harrisburg_transport_center.htm| year=2007| title=About the Harrisburg Transport Center|first=| last=| publisher=Tri-County Regional Planning Commission| accessdate = 2007-02-01}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regional scheduled line bus service===
The public transit provider in [[York County, Pennsylvania|York County]], [[Rabbit Transit (York)|Rabbit Transit]], operates its RabbitEXPRESS bus service on weekdays between the city of York and both downtown Harrisburg and the main campus for [[Harrisburg Area Community College]]. The commuter-oriented service is designed to serve York County residents who work in Harrisburg, though [[reverse commute]]s are possible under the current schedule. Buses running this route make limited stops in the city of York and at two [[park and ride]]s along [[Interstate 83]] between York and Harrisburg before making various stops in Pennsylvania's capital city. As of May 2007, the RabbitEXPRESS operates three times in the morning and three times in the afternoon.

A charter/tour bus operator, R &amp; J Transport, also provides weekday, scheduled route commuter service for people working in downtown Harrisburg. R &amp; J, which is based in [[Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania|Schuylkill County]], operates two lines, one between [[Frackville, Pennsylvania|Frackville]] and downtown Harrisburg and the other between [[Minersville, Pennsylvania|Minersville]], [[Pine Grove, Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania|Pine Grove]], and downtown Harrisburg.

===Rail===
The [[Pennsylvania Railroad]]'s main line from New York to Chicago passed through Harrisburg. The line was [[electrification|electrified]] in the 1930s, with the wires reaching Harrisburg in 1938. They went no further. Plans to electrify through to [[Pittsburgh]] and thence to Chicago never saw fruition; sufficient funding was never available. Thus, Harrisburg became where the PRR's crack expresses such as the [[Broadway Limited]] changed from electric traction to (originally) a [[steam locomotive]], and later a [[diesel locomotive]]. Harrisburg remained a freight rail hub for PRR's successor [[Conrail]], which was later sold off and divided between [[Norfolk Southern Railway|Norfolk Southern]] and [[CSX]].

====Freight rail====

Norfolk Southern acquired all of Conrail's lines in the Harrisburg area and has continued the city's function as a freight rail hub. Norfolk Southern considers Harrisburg one of many primary hubs in its system, and operates 2 [[intermodal freight transport|intermodal]] (rail/truck transfer) yards in the immediate Harrisburg area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1215/is_7_201/ai_64337963|title=NS opens intermodal hub at Harrisburg - Norfolk Southern - Brief Article (July 2000) | work=Railway Age | date=July 1, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Harrisburg Intermodal Yard]] (formerly called Lucknow Yard) is located in the north end of Harrisburg, approximately 3&amp;nbsp;miles north of downtown Harrisburg and the Harrisburg Transport Center, while the [[Rutherford Intermodal Yard]] is located approximately 6&amp;nbsp;miles east of downtown Harrisburg in [[Swatara Township, Dauphin County, Pennsylvania|Swatara Township, Dauphin County]]. Norfolk Southern also operates a significant [[classification yard]] in the Harrisburg area, the [[Enola Yard]], which is located across the Susquehanna River from Harrisburg in [[East Pennsboro Township, Pennsylvania|East Pennsboro Township, Cumberland County]].

====Intercity passenger rail====

[[Amtrak]] provides service to and from Harrisburg. The passenger rail operator runs its ''[[Keystone Service (Amtrak)|Keystone]]'' and ''[[Pennsylvanian (Amtrak)|Pennsylvanian]]'' services between New York, Philadelphia, and the [[Harrisburg Transportation Center]] daily. The ''Pennsylvanian'' route, which operates once daily, continues west to [[Pittsburgh]]. As of April 2007, Amtrak operates 14 weekday roundtrips and 8 weekend roundtrips daily between Harrisburg, [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]], and [[Philadelphia 30th Street Station]]; most of these trains also travel to and from [[New York Penn Station]]. The [[Keystone Corridor]] between Harrisburg and Philadelphia was improved in the mid-first decade of the 21st century, with the primary improvements completed in late 2006. The improvements included upgrading the electrical catenary, installing continuously welded rail, and replacing existing wooden railroad ties with concrete ties. These improvements increased train speeds to 110&amp;nbsp;mph along the corridor and reduced the travel time between Harrisburg and Philadelphia to as little as 95 minutes. It also eliminated the need to change locomotives at 30th Street Station (from diesel to electric and vice-versa) for trains continuing to or coming from New York. As of Federal Fiscal Year 2008, the Harrisburg Transportation Center was the 2nd busiest Amtrak station in Pennsylvania and 21st busiest in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.amtrak.com/pdf/factsheets/PENNSYLVANIA08.pdf| year=2008| title=Amtrak Passenger Station Factsheet|first=| last=| publisher=Amtrak| accessdate=2009-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amtrak.com/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=Amtrak/am2Copy/Title_Image_Copy_Page&amp;c=am2Copy&amp;cid=1081442674300&amp;ssid=542| year=2008|title=Amtrak National Facts|first=| last=| publisher=Amtrak| accessdate=2009-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bridges===

{{See also|List of crossings of the Susquehanna River}}
Harrisburg is the location of over a dozen large bridges, many up to a mile long, that cross the Susquehanna River. Several other important structures span the [[Paxton Creek]] watershed and [[Cameron Street]], linking [[Downtown Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Center City]] with neighborhoods in [[East Harrisburg]]. These include the [[State Street Bridge (Harrisburg, Pennsylvania)|State Street Bridge]], also known as the Soldiers and Sailor's Memorial Bridge, and the [[Mulberry Street Bridge]]. Walnut Street Bridge, now used only by pedestrians and cyclists, links the downtown and [[Riverfront Park (Harrisburg)|Riverfront Park]] areas with [[City Island (Pennsylvania)|City Island]] but goes no further as spans are missing on its western side due to massive flooding resulting from the North American blizzard of 1996.

==Education==

===Public schools===
{{main|Harrisburg School District (Pennsylvania)}}
The City of Harrisburg is served by the [[Harrisburg School District (Pennsylvania)|Harrisburg School District]]. The [[school district]] provides education for the city's youth beginning with all-day [[kindergarten]] through twelfth grade. A multi-year restructuring plan is aimed at making the district a model for urban [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]]. The district has been troubled for years with management fiascos and poor test scores. In the summer of 2007, more than 2,000 city students were enrolled in educational programs offered by the Harrisburg School District as remediation.&lt;ref&gt;Patton, Judith, &quot;Summer schools draw 2,000 Harrisburg students&quot;, PennLive, July 24, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The city also maintains one public [[charter school]], the [http://www.shscs.org/ Sylvan Heights Science Charter School]. In addition, Harrisburg is home to an arts-focused [[magnet school]], the [[Capital Area School for the Arts]]. In 2003, [[SciTech High]], a regional math and science magnet school affiliated with [[Harrisburg University of Science and Technology|Harrisburg University]], opened its doors to students. A growing number of virtual public charter schools provide residents with many alternative to the bricks and mortar public school system.

The [[Central Dauphin School District]], the largest public school district in the [[Harrisburg metropolitan area|metropolitan area]] and the 13th largest in Pennsylvania, uses several Harrisburg postal addresses for many of the districts schools.

===Private schools===
Harrisburg is home to an extensive Catholic educational system. There are nearly 40 parish-driven elementary schools and seven Catholic high schools within the region administered by the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Harrisburg]], including [[Bishop McDevitt High School (Harrisburg, Pennsylvania)|Bishop McDevitt High School]] and [[Trinity High School (Camp Hill, Pennsylvania)|Trinity High School]]. Numerous other private schools, such as [http://www.thelondonderryschool.org/ The Londonderry School] and [[The Circle School]], which is a [[Sudbury Valley School|Sudbury Model]] school, also operate in Harrisburg. [[Harrisburg Academy]], founded in 1784, is one of the oldest independent [[college preparatory]] schools in the nation. The [http://www.yeshivaacademy.org Rabbi David L.

==Notable people==

Since the early 18th century, Harrisburg has been home to many people of note. Because it is the seat of government for the state and lies relatively close to other urban centers, Harrisburg has played a significant role in the nation's political, cultural and industrial history. ''Harrisburgers'' have also taken a leading role in the development of Pennsylvania's history for over two centuries. Two former U.S. Secretaries of War, [[Simon Cameron]] and [[Alexander Ramsey]] and several other prominent political figures, such as former speaker of the house [[Newt Gingrich]], hail from Harrisburg. The actor [[Don Keefer]] was born near Harrisburg, along with the actor Richard Sanders, most famous for playing Les Nessman in WKRP in Cincinnati . Many notable individuals are interred at [[Harrisburg Cemetery]] and [[East Harrisburg Cemetery]].

'''DuBois''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|uː|b|ɔɪ|z}} {{respell|DOO|boys}} is a [[city]] in [[Clearfield County, Pennsylvania|Clearfield County]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[United States]], {{convert|91|mi|km}} northeast of [[Pittsburgh]]. The population was 7,794 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. It is the principal city in the [[DuBois, PA Micropolitan Statistical Area]].

==History==
Settled in 1812 and [[plat|platted]] in 1872, DuBois was incorporated as a [[borough (Pennsylvania)|borough]] in 1881 and as a city in 1914. While DuBois was founded as a lumber town, the mining of [[bituminous coal]] quickly became the chief industry in DuBois, supporting a population of 9,375 in 1900; 12,623 in 1910; 13,681 in 1920; and 12,080 in 1940. The population was 8,123 at the 2000 census. Over the years there have been numerous unsuccessful attempts to combine the city with the surrounding [[Sandy Township, Clearfield County, Pennsylvania|Sandy Township]].

The town was founded by John Rumbarger, for whom the town was originally named. The Rumbarger Cemetery is all that survives of this original settlement. The town was later renamed for local lumber magnate John DuBois, who came from a longstanding American family of French [[Huguenot]] descent.

The [[Commercial Hotel (DuBois, Pennsylvania)|Commercial Hotel]] was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1985, and the [[DuBois Historic District]] was listed in 1997.&lt;ref name=&quot;nris&quot;&gt;{{NRISref|version=2010a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture and the arts ==

The DuBois tri-county area is building a strong reputation in local entertainment and the arts.  DuBois is the hometown of Educational Entertainment Specialist Gene Allen, known for his character education programs for schools and libraries. More traditional arts can be found at the Winkler Gallery, which shows and merchandises the works of local artists including founder Perry Winkler, as well as the annual arts festival.  The theater group the &quot;Reitz Theater Players&quot; along with &quot;Cultural Resources Inc.&quot; also performs a selection of theater productions each year at the Paul G. Reitz Theater in downtown DuBois.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reitztheater.com/ Paul G. Reitz Theater DuBois PA&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Brewery ==

There seems to be some debate as to exactly when Frank Hahne came to DuBois and broke ground on his own facility.  One source claims 1898, another 1897.  It seems most likely that this occurred between April and the end of 1896. It was on April 16, 1896, that the DuBois Weekly Courier reported: &quot;Some new developments in connection with the brewery may be looked for in the near future.&quot;

There were a number of reasons Hahne chose the DuBois site for his facility, but the most frequently cited was the excellence of the water supply. He purchased {{convert|2300|acre|km2}} surrounding the local reservoir to protect the watershed from pollution.

By 1906, the brewery had four products on the market: DuBois Wurzburger, Hahne's Export Pilsener, DuBois Porter, and DuBois Budweiser. The Budweiser name would be at the center of controversy for 60 years between DuBois Brewing and Anheuser-Busch.

The DuBois brands soon traveled far and wide for a brewery of its size; ranging up to {{convert|150|mi|km}} away and selling well in Buffalo, Erie and Pittsburgh. The brewery's 300 barrel kettle was kept busy churning out brands, while the left-over grain materials were pressed and sold for cattle feed and grist mills in the rural areas surrounding DuBois.

As with many other American breweries, DuBois Brewing moved right along until 1918 and the advent of Prohibition.  The brewery shifted production to &quot;near beer&quot; and soft drinks and opened the H&amp;G Ice Company.  According to the April 7, 1933, DuBois Courier, the brewery won the honor of being one of only two breweries in the entire nation that had never violated or been suspected of violating the Prohibition laws since the 18th Amendment went into effect.  As a result, DuBois Brewing Company was issued license number G-2, allowing them to resume brewing immediately upon the enaction of the 21st Amendment. Other breweries had to wait for varying periods as a form of punishment.  On the first day of beer production, DuBois products sold at between 10 and 15 cents per pint bottle.  A glass at local taverns was 10 cents.

Frank Hahne died in 1932, and the brewery was passed to his son, Frank Jr. Frank Jr. was the Hahne's only son, and ''his'' only son died in infancy, leaving the family without an heir. Hahne Jr. sold the brewery to Pittsburgh Brewing in 1967.

The new owners of the Budweiser name reportedly &quot;settled&quot; with Anheuser-Busch to the tune of a $1 million profit for Pittsburgh Brewing. Five years later, in May 1972, the brewery was closed forever, leaving 100 workers out of a job.

The Brewery was torn down in late 2008 to make way for business development. One group rumored to be interested in the site is Dr. Gary Ott and the DuBois Regional Medical Center (DRMC). Dr. Ott intends on opening a women's health center on the lot, built in 2011.

'''Greensburg''' is a [[Laurel Highlands]] city in [[Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania|Westmoreland County]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[United States]], and a part of the [[Pittsburgh Metro Area]].  The area lies within the [[ecoregion]] of the [[Western Allegheny Plateau (ecoregion)|Western Allegheny Plateau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Level III Ecoregions of {{sic|Penns|lyvania|hide=y}} |url=http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/cropmap/pennsylvania/maps/PAeco3.html |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=29 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city is named after [[Nathanael Greene]], a [[major general]] of the [[Continental Army]] in the [[American Revolutionary War]]. Greensburg is the [[county seat]] of [[Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania|Westmoreland County]], with a population of 14,892 people residing in the city, and a combined total of around 60,000 people in the 15601 zip code.{{GR|6}}

Located southeast of [[Pittsburgh]], Greensburg is a major [[business]], [[academic]], [[tourism]] and [[cultural center]] in [[Western Pennsylvania]]. It is evident as the city's [[population]] doubles during work hours. The city ranks seventh in Pennsylvania in terms of daytime growth, behind [[Pittsburgh]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]], [[King of Prussia, Pennsylvania|King of Prussia]], [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]], and [[State College, Pennsylvania|State College]]. It also ranks 16th in the United States for daytime growth among towns with a resident population between 15,000 to 24,999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/s_386741.html |title=Workers swell Greensburg's population during day|publisher=Pittsburgh Tribune-Review|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Greensburg was ranked as one of the &quot;Best Places to Retire&quot; in Pennsylvania by ''[[U.S.News &amp; World Report|U.S. News &amp; World Report]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usnews.com/listings/retirement/pennsylvania/greensburg |title=Greensburg, Pennsylvania: Best Places to Retire|publisher=U.S. News &amp; World Report|year=2007|accessdate=2008-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
After the end of the Revolutionary War, an inn was built along a wagon trail that stretched from [[Philadelphia]] west over the [[Appalachian Mountains]] to [[Fort Pitt (Pennsylvania)|Fort Pitt]], now the city of [[Pittsburgh]]. A tiny settlement known as Newtown grew around the inn, today the center of Greensburg's Business District at the intersection of Pittsburgh and Main Streets. At Pittsburgh, the wagon trail became [[Penn Avenue]].

In 1782, a raid by [[Guyasuta]]-led [[Seneca Indians]] accompanied by Canadian rangers burned [[Hannastown, Pennsylvania|Hannastown]], the original [[Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania|Westmoreland County]] seat, north of Greensburg, and the first [[county seat]] west of the [[Allegheny Mountains]]. Newtown became the new county seat in 1785. In 1786, the county built a log courthouse on land purchased from two residents, Christopher Truby and William Jack. The [[Westmoreland County Courthouse]], in its various incarnations, has stood on this site. The area surrounding the courthouse became the original borough of Greensburg, named for [[American Revolutionary War]] General [[Nathanael Greene]], and formally incorporated as a borough in 1799.

In the early 19th century, Greensburg had very little growth. After 1850, Greensburg became a growing county seat with inns, small businesses and hardworking residents. It was a [[railroad]] stop and the discovery of large areas of soft [[coal]] nearby made it the center of a vigorous [[mining industry]] in the late 19th century and early 20th century.

[[Seton Hill University|Seton Hill College]], formerly St. Joseph's Academy, became a four-year women's institution in 1918. Greensburg became a Third-Class City on January 2, 1928. After [[World War II]], more residential areas were developed in various sections of town. Greensburg's cultural status grew as the Westmoreland County Museum of Art opened in 1959 and the [[University of Pittsburgh]] founded the branch campus, [[University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg]], in 1963, now located in [[Hempfield Township, Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania|Hempfield Township]].

The opening of [[Greengate Mall]] and [[Westmoreland Mall]] in 1965 and 1977, respectively, marked a new era for retail shopping in the area, but negatively impacted retail businesses in Downtown Greensburg's shopping district. Changes in local shopping habits had already taken its toll by the late 1970s when Troutman's Department Store closed. By the mid-1990s, city officials shifted its revitalization plans on the cultural aspects of Downtown Greensburg, such as the restorations of the Palace Theater and the historic Train Station, as well as a new, recently opened [[performing arts]] center for [[Seton Hill University]]. Also, in July 2009, Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine, the largest medical school in the country, opened a satellite campus at Seton Hill University. Now over 200 students study at LECOM at Seton Hill every year. As part of this ongoing transition, an expansion of the [[Westmoreland Museum of American Art]] is also in the planning stages.

The city is home of the Roman Catholic [[Diocese of Greensburg]].

=== Historical facts ===
*Greensburg's first log school house was located at the site of St. Clair Park.
*St. Clair Park was originally a [[cemetery]]. When the borough banned cemeteries, St. Clair cemetery was moved to its current location, just east of town.
*Mt. Odin Park was originally the estate of Dr. Frank Cowan, attorney, physician, author and former Secretary to [[President]] [[Andrew Johnson]]. Dr. Cowan willed his land to Greensburg to be used for recreational purposes.

== Neighborhoods and wards ==
The city of Greensburg is currently composed of eight wards, most of which were formerly boroughs and are divided into several neighborhoods. Bunker Hill, now Fifth Ward, was merged into Greensburg in 1894. The name originated because of fights at the rowdy Bushfield Tavern in the early 1840s to mid-19th century that were compared to the [[Battle of Bunker Hill]].

In 1905, Greensburg absorbed three adjacent boroughs, including Ludwick, now Sixth Ward, which was named for Ludwick Otterman, an early settler for whom the street is also named, as well as East Greensburg, now Seventh Ward, and Southeast Greensburg, unofficially known as Paradise (Eighth Ward).  South Maple Avenue was originally named Kinderhook (Third Ward). Second Ward, located north of Downtown Greensburg, is the largest ward and includes the neighborhoods of Saybrook Village, Evergreen Hill, New Salem Acres, Country Club Meadows, Northmont, Devonshire Heights, Rose Fountain Farms and Academy Hill. Hilltop, a neighborhood in Eighth Ward, was originally settled by Italian immigrants and borders South Greensburg and Underwood on either side. First Ward features Chestnut Hill and Shuey Plan, and is also home to Seton Hill University. Other Greensburg neighborhoods include Eastern Estates, Underwood, Shogan and Hillcrest.

Eighth Ward was originally home to many Italian immigrants from [[Cercemaggiore|Cercemaggiore, Italy]]. Today, the original Our Lady of Grace church, built by the masons from Italy, still stands although used as a residence. The Hilltop Social Club, founded by a few families who lived in the areas of Bierer, Margaret, White and Catherine Streets is also located here. Every year it has become a tradition for the firehall in the Eighth Ward to throw a carnival which includes bingo, amusement rides, and of course the famous Shuey Burgers.{{Clarify|date=February 2009}}

Two neighborhoods have been designated as U.S. historic districts, the [[Greensburg Downtown Historic District (Greensburg, Pennsylvania)|Greensburg Downtown Historic District]] and the [[Academy Hill Historic District (Greensburg, Pennsylvania)|Academy Hill Historic District]].  Also listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] are the [[Greensburg (Amtrak station)|Greensburg Railroad Station]] and [[Westmoreland County Courthouse]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nris&quot;&gt;{{NRISref|version=2010a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Government and politics ==
Greensburg is an incorporated city governed by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[mayor]] Ronald E. Silvis and a four-member [[City Council]]. The mayor and the City Council members serve four-year terms. The [[seat of government]] is the Greensburg City Hall.

The small size of Greensburg has not deterred it from being a player on the political scene. Greensburg has hosted its share of prominent politicians over the years, including a July 1994 visit from then-President [[Bill Clinton]], former Democratic candidate [[John Kerry]] and his [[running mate]] [[John Edwards]] in July 2004 and Democratic candidates [[Hillary Clinton]] and [[Barack Obama]] in March 2008. It was also, according to local historians, the site of the 1854 National Republican Party convention&amp;nbsp;– the first convention of the Grand Old Republican Party, despite Pittsburgh's claims.
=== Military ===
Greensburg is home to the [[14th Quartermaster Detachment]], a famous Desert Storm Unit. There is also a [[Pennsylvania National Guard|National Guard]] [[Armory (military)|Armory]] just outside the main City.

== Economy ==
[[Image:greensburg-pennsylvania-troutmans.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The former Troutman's Department Store on South Main Street]]
Originally a [[railroad]] stop on the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]], Greensburg quickly became the center of the coal mining industry in the region by the late 19th century when large areas of soft coal were discovered nearby. This contributed to the growth and development of the growing county seat. Many businesses and inns flourished within Downtown Greensburg for many years, and once boasted four major department stores&amp;nbsp;– [[JCPenney]], Royers, [[Sears]] and its largest department store, Troutman's.

In August 1965, Greengate Mall opened west of the city in [[Hempfield Township, Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania|Hempfield Township]]. Greengate was part of the first wave of indoor shopping malls in the country. The mall's opening marked a new era for retail shopping in the area, but it negatively impacted stand-alone businesses in Greensburg's downtown corridor. By the late 1970s, several local stores, including Troutman's, the city's major department store, closed. The downtown area eventually rebounded as the city became a center for [[service industries]], professional offices and [[banking]]. Today, small downtown shops and a growing number of restaurants are reviving downtown as a mercantile center.

[[Westmoreland Mall]] is currently the largest shopping complex in the Greensburg area and all of Westmoreland County. Greengate Mall suffered losses in the 1990s when anchor store [[JCPenney]] relocated to Westmoreland Mall. As the mall continued on its irreversible decline, the nationally-based [[Montgomery Ward]] and the regional chain [[Joseph Horne Co.|Horne's]] also closed. The building was eventually razed in 2003, and a new shopping center called [[Greengate Centre]], anchored by a [[Walmart]], was subsequently built. Numerous shopping plazas and dining establishments also line the Route 30 corridor east and west of the city. With over {{convert|5000000|sqft|m2}} of retail space and growing, Greensburg is considered the commercial center of the [[Laurel Highlands]] region of Pennsylvania as well as one of the largest retail markets in Western Pennsylvania.

Light to moderate industry and service industries thrive in the Greater Greensburg area. Several industrial parks are primarily located outside the city limits. In addition, the area is home to two large prisons, the Westmoreland County Prison and the State Correctional Institution at Greensburg, both in Hempfield Township. Housing growth continues on the northern end of the city, with the Saybrook Village and Evergreen Hill plans. The opening of the seven-story State Office Building on North Main Street, the completion of the four-story addition to the Courthouse Square Extension, and the Performing Arts Center of [[Seton Hill University]] are expected to add new jobs to the city and attract more visitors.

== Education ==
=== Public schools ===
[[Image:LynchHall.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg]]]]
The Greater Greensburg area contains two public school districts. The larger of the two is the [[Hempfield Area School District]]. The school district has a resident population of over 50,000 and spans approximately ninety-five square miles and lies thirty miles southeast of Pittsburgh. Comprising Hempfield Township, and the boroughs of Adamsburg, Hunker, Manor, New Stanton, and Youngwood, the school district completely surrounds the city of Greensburg. Hempfield is also the largest school district in Westmoreland County with approximately 7,000 enrolled students and is one of the largest in Western Pennsylvania.

The second school district servicing Greensburg itself is the [[Greensburg-Salem School District|Greensburg Salem School District]]. The school district covers an area of fifty-one square miles. With an enrollment of 3,600 students, Greensburg Salem serves the City of Greensburg, [[South Greensburg, Pennsylvania|South Greensburg]], [[Southwest Greensburg, Pennsylvania|Southwest Greensburg]] and [[Salem Township, Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania|Salem Township]]. Detailed information including enrollment figures and test scores about Greensburg Salem can be found [http://www.greatschools.net/modperl/browse_district/227/pa/ on this website.]

=== Private schools ===
Greensburg is home to [[Greensburg Central Catholic High School]] and Aquinas Academy ([http://www.aquinasacademy.org www.aquinasacademy.org]), both private Catholic schools.

=== Colleges and universities ===
The immediate vicinity of Greensburg contains two major universities&amp;nbsp;– [[Seton Hill University]] and the [[University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg]]. Seton Hill University was founded in 1885 by the [[Sisters of Charity]] on a bluff overlooking the City of Greensburg. Formerly a women's college, Seton Hill became a coeducational university in 2002. In recent years, Seton Hill has begun to expand into the downtown area with the construction of several academic buildings and a performing arts center. The Greensburg campus of the University of Pittsburgh was founded in 1963 in Downtown Greensburg, and would later grow into a large campus in nearby Hempfield Township. It was voted &quot;Best University in the Region&quot; for eight straight years (1999–2007) by the ''Tribune-Review''. In addition, the branches of [[Carlow University]], [[Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine]] and [[Triangle Tech]] are located within the Greater Greensburg area.

The campuses of [[Saint Vincent College]] and [[Westmoreland County Community College]] are also located in the nearby communities of [[Latrobe, Pennsylvania|Latrobe]] and [[Youngwood, Pennsylvania|Youngwood]], respectively.

=== Libraries ===
The Greensburg Hempfield Area Library serves the City of Greensburg and [[Hempfield Township, Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania|Hempfield Township]].

== Arts and culture ==
[[Image:greensburg-pennsylvania-ymca.jpg|thumb|right|250px|YMCA]]
Greensburg is a major cultural center in Western Pennsylvania. It is the home of the [[Westmoreland Museum of American Art]], which specializes in American Art circa 1750–1950. The Palace Theatre, in the heart of the city's emerging cultural district, is the site for various performances throughout the year. Additionally, it is the home of the Westmoreland Symphony Orchestra, and the [http://www.summersounds.com Summer Sounds] Concert Series at the Robertshaw Amphitheater in St. Clair Park.

The Westmoreland Cultural Trust has played a major role in the revitalization of Downtown Greensburg in recent years. Its accomplishments include the ongoing renovation of the Palace Theatre and the [http://www.westmorelandculturaltrust.org/greensburg_train.htm restoration] ([http://www.keefeg.com/trainstation/ Before/After Pictures]) of the circa 1910 Train Station. They are also responsible for renovating several commercial buildings in the downtown area.

[[Stage Right!]] also contributes to the culture of the region, offering classes in musical theatre for young people and staging professional productions at the Palace Theater and Greensburg Garden and Civic Center.

Greensburg Civic Theatre, one of the few long-established volunteer-based community theatre organizations in Westmoreland County, has been presenting both adult and children's theater productions for over 60 years. Founded in 1951, they are the resident theatre company at the Greensburg Garden and Civic Center.

The [http://alumni.setonhill.edu/s/279/index.aspx?sid=279&amp;gid=1&amp;pgid=12&amp;cid=120&amp;campaign_id=3 Performance Arts Center] of Seton Hill University opened its doors to the public in September 2009. This multi-million dollar complex, located in the city's Cultural District, is expected to serve as an additional catalyst for the future growth of the downtown core.

A hands-on [[science center]], to feature a wide range of interactive exhibits, was proposed for the former Mellon Bank building downtown, but it has since been put on hold indefinitely. Titled the Discovery &amp; Interactive Science Center (DISC), it was to be a regional attraction for Westmoreland, Fayette, Indiana, Somerset and Bedford counties. It would've also been the only interactive science center between the Carnegie Science Center in Pittsburgh and the Harsco Science Center in Harrisburg.

[[File:Greensburg 1894.jpg|200px|thumb|right| Greensburg Athletic Association: 1894]]
From 1890 until 1900, Greensburg was the home of the [[Greensburg Athletic Association]], one of the earliest professional [[American football|football]] teams. The team began as an amateur football club in 1890 and was composed primarily of locals before several paid players were added for 1895. In 1894 it was discovered that the team had secretly paid formerly Indiana Normal (now [[Indiana University of Pennsylvania]]) player, [[Lawson Fiscus]], to play football and retained his services on salary. The team was the chief rival of another early professional football team, the [[Latrobe Athletic Association]].

Aside from Fiscus, the Greensburg Athletic Association included several of the era's top players, such as: [[Charlie Atherton]], [[George Barclay (baseball)|George Barclay]], [[Ross Fiscus]], [[Jack Gass]], [[Arthur McFarland]], [[Charles Rinehart]], [[Isaac Seneca]] and [[Adam Martin Wyant]]. Several of these players revolutionized the game during their playing careers. Charlie Atherton is credited with inventing the [[place kick]], and George Barclay invented the first-ever [[football helmet]]. Meanwhile Isaac Seneca became the first [[Native Americans in the United States|Native-American]] to earn [[All-American]] honors and Adam Wyant was the first professional football player to become a [[United States Congress]]man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The History of Pro Football At Greensburg, Pennsylvania (1894-1900) | journal=Coffin Corner | publisher=Professional Football Researchers Association | volume= | issue=Annual | year=1983 | pages=1–14 | url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Coffin_Corner/05-An-165.pdf | authors=Van Atta, Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''McKeesport''' is a city in [[Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Allegheny County]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Pennsylvania]]; it is situated at the [[confluence]] of the [[Monongahela River|Monongahela]] and [[Youghiogheny River|Youghiogheny]] rivers and is part of the [[Pittsburgh Metro Area]]. The population was 19,731 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Census 2010&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://factfinder2.census.gov| title=Race, Hispanic or Latino, Age, and Housing Occupancy: 2010 Census Redistricting Data (Public Law 94-171) Summary File (QT-PL), McKeesport city, Pennsylvania| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau, American FactFinder 2| accessdate=September 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the second-largest [[city]] (not including [[Township (Pennsylvania)|townships]], [[Borough (Pennsylvania)|boroughs]], and [[Home Rule Municipality (Pennsylvania)|Home Rule Municipalities]]) in the county after [[Pittsburgh]].

Settled in 1795 and named in honor of John McKee, its founder, McKeesport remained a village until 1830 when [[coal mining]] began in the region. Large deposits of [[bituminous coal]] existed.

McKeesport was incorporated as a borough in 1842 and as a city in 1891. Its population grew steadily until the mid-20th century, when it peaked in the 1940s. The city's population in 1900 was 34,227; in 1910, 42,694; in 1920, 45,975; and in 1940, 55,355. The decrease in the population since the 1940s is attributable to the general economic malaise that descended upon the region when the steelmaking industry moved elsewhere. The major employer was the [[National Tube Works]], a manufacturer of iron pipes, which once employed 10,000 men. McKeesport was the site of the first [[G. C. Murphy]] [[five-and-ten-cent store]].

== History ==

===Early history===
John McKee, an original settler of [[Philadelphia]] and son of David McKee, built a log cabin near the confluence of the Monongahela and Youghiogheny rivers, the site of present-day McKeesport. After taking over his father's local river [[ferry]] business, he devised a plan for a city to be called McKee's Port. John set out his proposal in the ''Pittsburgh Gazette'', as part of a program under which new residents could purchase plots of land for $20.00 (a lottery was the means to distribute the plots to avoid complaints from new land owners concerning &quot;inferior&quot; locations).

Around the time of the [[French and Indian Wars]], [[George Washington]] often came to McKeesport to visit his friend, [[Queen Alliquippa]], a [[Seneca people|Seneca]] Indian ruler. After being settled by the McKee family in 1795, McKeesport began to grow in 1830 when coal mining began. The first schoolhouse was built in 1832, with James E.

'''Pittsburgh''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɪ|t|s|b|ər|ɡ}}, {{Respell|PITS|burg}}) is the [[county seat|seat]] of [[Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Allegheny County]] and with a population of 306,211 is the second-largest city in the [[U.S.]] state of [[Pennsylvania]]. With a metropolitan [[Combined statistical area|CSA]] population of 2,661,369, it is the largest in both the [[Ohio Valley]] and [[Appalachia]] and the 20th-[[List of Combined Statistical Areas|largest in the U.S.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{USCensus-2012PA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pittsburgh is known as both &quot;the Steel City&quot; for its more than 300 steel-related businesses and &quot;[[Bridges of Pittsburgh|the City of Bridges]]&quot; for its world-record 446 bridges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Pittsburgh Names}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city also features [[List of tallest buildings in Pittsburgh|29 skyscrapers]], 2 [[Funicular|inclined railways]], a [[Fort Pitt Blockhouse|pre-revolutionary fortification]], and the [[Point State Park|source of the Ohio]] at the confluence of the [[Monongahela River|Monongahela]] and [[Allegheny River|Allegheny Rivers]].

== Etymology ==
{{Main|Etymology of Pittsburgh}}
Pittsburgh was founded by [[John Forbes (general)|General John Forbes]] in 1758 who named it in honor of the British statesman [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt]]. Forbes was  [[Scotsman|Scottish]] and it is conjectured that the pronunciation for the settlement name was originally intended to be {{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɪ|t|s|b|ᵊ|r|ə}} {{respell|PITS|brə}} or {{respell|PITS|bə-rə}} (similar to [[Edinburgh]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Pittsburgh etymology}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pittsburgh was incorporated as a [[Borough (Pennsylvania)|borough]] in 1794 and chartered as a city in 1816.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/03001/700027-209.stm |title=Pittsburgh Facts |work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |accessdate=October 21, 2007 | date=January 1, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pittsburgh was officially named with its present spelling on April 22, 1794, by an act of the Pennsylvania Department, stating, &quot;Be it enacted by the [[Pennsylvania State Senate|Senate]] and [[Pennsylvania House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, in General Assembly met, and it is hereby enacted by the authority of the same, that the said town of Pittsburgh shall be, and the same is hereby, erected into a borough, which shall be called the borough of Pittsburgh for ever.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;spell&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.carnegielibrary.org/exhibit/hname2.html |title=How to Spell Pittsburgh |work=[[Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh]] |accessdate=September 22, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pittsburgh is one of the few American cities to be spelled with an ''h'' at the end of a ''burg'' suffix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epodunk.com/top10/misspelled/index.html |title=Most Misspelled Cities in America |accessdate=October 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1890 to 1911 the city was called Pittsburg but after a public campaign the Pittsburgh spelling was officially restored by the [[United States Board on Geographic Names]].&lt;ref name=&quot;spell&quot;/&gt;

During 1753–54, the British hastily built Fort Prince George, but a larger French expedition forced them to evacuate and the expedition then proceeded to construct [[Fort Duquesne]] on the site. With the French citing the 1669 discovery by LaSalle, these events led to the [[French and Indian War]]. British General [[Edward Braddock]]'s campaign (with Washington as his aide) to take Fort Duquesne failed,&lt;ref name=&quot;WDL&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/9580/ |title = The Battle of the Monongahela |website = [[World Digital Library]] |year = 1755 |accessdate = 2013-08-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but [[John Forbes (General)|General John Forbes]]'s subsequent campaign succeeded. After the French abandoned and destroyed Fort Bridgewater in 1758, Forbes ordered the construction of [[Fort Pitt (Pennsylvania)|Fort Pitt]], named after British Secretary of State [[William Pitt the Elder]].

During [[Pontiac's Rebellion]], Ohio Valley and Great Lakes tribes [[siege of Fort Pitt|besieged Fort Pitt]] for two months. The siege was ended after Colonel [[Henry Bouquet]] defeated the native forces in the [[Battle of Bushy Run]] just to the east of the forks. This victory was purportedly facilitated by an early example of biological warfare. In July 1763, Lord [[Jeffrey Amherst]] is claimed to have ordered the distribution of blankets inoculated with smallpox to the Native Americans surrounding the fort, although this claim is disputed.&lt;ref name=&quot;d'Errico&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nativeweb.org/pages/legal/amherst/lord_jeff.html|title=Jeffrey Amherst and Smallpox Blankets: Lord Jeffrey Amherst's letters discussing germ warfare against American Indians|last=d'Errico|first=Peter|publisher=Nativeweb|accessdate=August 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1768 [[Treaty of Fort Stanwix]], the descendants of [[William Penn]] purchased from the [[Iroquois|Six Nations]] western lands that included most of the present site of Pittsburgh. In 1769, a survey was made of the land situated between the two rivers, called the &quot;Manor of Pittsburgh&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;PCC&quot;&gt;{{cite book| title=Pittsburgh First, the Official Organ of The Chamber of Commerce of Pittsburgh | author=Chamber of Commerce of Pittsburgh| year=1921}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]] and [[Province of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]] claimed the Pittsburgh area during colonial times and would continue to do so until 1780 when both states agreed to extend the [[Mason-Dixon Line]] westward, placing Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania.

Following the [[American Revolution]], the village of Pittsburgh continued to grow. One of its earliest industries was building boats for settlers to enter the [[Ohio Country]]. In 1784, the laying out of the &quot;Town of Pittsburgh&quot; was completed by Thomas Viceroy of Bedford County and approved by the attorney of the Penns in Philadelphia. In 1785, Pittsburgh became a possession of the state of Pennsylvania. The following year, the [[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] was started, and in 1787, the Pittsburgh Academy (which would later become the [[University of Pittsburgh]]) was chartered. The year 1794 saw the short-lived [[Whiskey Rebellion]]. By 1797, glass began to be manufactured in the city as the population grew to around 1400. The Act of March 5, 1804, which modified the provision of the old charter of the Borough of Pittsburgh in 1794 (the original of which is not known to exist), refers throughout to the &quot;Borough of Pittsburgh&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;PCC&quot; /&gt;{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}&lt;!-- We need page numbers. --&gt;

The [[War of 1812]] cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American manufacture. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing significant quantities of iron, brass, tin and glass products. The Act of March 18, 1816 incorporated the City of Pittsburgh. The original charter was burned when the old [[Court House]] was destroyed by fire. In the 1830s, many [[Welsh people]] from the steelworks of [[Merthyr]] migrated to the city following the civil strife and aftermath of the [[Merthyr Rising 1831|Merthyr Riots]] of 1831. By the 1840s, Pittsburgh was one of the largest cities west of the [[Allegheny Mountains]]. A great fire burned over a thousand buildings in 1845, but the city rebuilt. By 1857, Pittsburgh's 1,000 factories were consuming 22,000,000 bushels of coal yearly.

The [[American Civil War]] boosted the city's economy with increased production of iron and armaments. Steel production began by 1875, when [[Andrew Carnegie]] founded the [[Edgar Thomson Steel Works]] in [[North Braddock, Pennsylvania|North Braddock]], which eventually evolved into the [[Carnegie Steel Company]]. The success and growth of Carnegie Steel is attributed to [[Henry Bessemer]] who had developed the [[Bessemer Process]] to facilitate the low cost mass production of steel.

In 1901, the [[U.S. Steel]] Corporation was formed. By 1911 Pittsburgh was the [[Largest cities in the United States by population by decade|nation's eighth largest city]] accounting for between a third and a half of the national steel output. The city's population swelled to over a half million, many of whom were immigrants from Europe who arrived via the great migration through [[Ellis Island]]. In 1940, non-Hispanic whites were 90.6% of the city's population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Race and Hispanic Origin for Selected Cities and Other Places: Earliest Census to 1990|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|url=http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html|accessdate=January 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] from the South resulted in a large increase in Pittsburgh's African-American population.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.post-gazette.com/lifestyle/20030218kids0218P9.asp Kids' Corner: 1910–30 saw huge black migration]&quot;.

Following the war, the city launched a clean air and civic revitalization project known as the &quot;Renaissance.&quot; This much-acclaimed effort was followed by the &quot;Renaissance II&quot; project, begun in 1977 and focusing more on cultural and neighborhood development than its predecessor. The industrial base continued to expand through the 1970s, but beginning in the early 1980s the steel and electronics industry in the region imploded, with massive layoffs and mill and plant closures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wMobAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=OmMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=westinghouse%20east%20pittsburgh&amp;pg=5909%2C3162564 East Pittsburgh crunch].

Beginning in the late 1980s, the city shifted its economic base to education, tourism, and services, largely based on healthcare/medicine, finance and high technology such as robotics. Although Pittsburgh successfully shifted the focus of its economy and remained a viable city, the city's population never rebounded to its industrial-era highs. While 680,000 people lived in the city proper in 1950, a combination of suburbanization and economic turbulence caused a sharp decrease in city population to just 330,000 in the year 2000.&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;Although medical research is often cited as a recent addition to Pittsburgh's economic portfolio, major advances go back several decades. Working at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] in the 1950s, [[Jonas Salk]] developed the first successful vaccine for large-scale immunization against [[poliomyelitis]] (a.k.a. polio or infantile paralysis). Also, several types of organ transplants were pioneered in Pittsburgh by Dr. [[Thomas Starzl]] beginning in 1983. Pittsburgh's hospitals and universities remain the hosts for some of the premier medical research facilities in the world.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[late 2000s recession]], however, Pittsburgh remained economically strong, adding jobs when most cities were losing them, and becoming one of the few cities in the United States to see housing property values rise. In the period between 2006 and 2011, the Pittsburgh [[Metropolitan Statistical Area|MSA]] experienced over 10% appreciation in housing prices—the highest appreciation out of the largest 25 MSAs in the United States. 22 of the top 25 MSAs saw a depreciation of housing values during the same period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nullspace2.blogspot.com/2011/12/more-pittsburgh-real-estate-trends.html|title=More Pittsburgh real estate trends|last=Briem|first=Christopher|date=December 30, 2011|work=Nullspace|accessdate=January 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pittsburgh's story of economic regeneration was the inspiration for President [[Barack Obama]] to personally select Pittsburgh as the host city for the 2009 [[2009 G-20 Pittsburgh summit|G-20 Summit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8072894.stm |work=BBC News | title=US to host next G20 world meeting | date=May 28, 2009 | accessdate=May 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(See also:  Regional Identity)

[[File:Duquesne Incline from top.jpg|thumb|[[Downtown Pittsburgh]] and the [[Duquesne Incline]] from [[Mt. Washington (Pittsburgh)|Mt. Washington]]]]

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], Pittsburgh has a total area of {{convert|58.3|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|55.6|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|2.8|sqmi|km2}} (or 4.75%) is water. The [[80th meridian west]] passes directly through the city's downtown.

The city is on the [[Allegheny Plateau]], within the [[ecoregion]] of the [[Western Allegheny Plateau (ecoregion)|Western Allegheny Plateau]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Level III Ecoregions of {{sic|Pennsl|yvania|hide=y}}|url=http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/cropmap/pennsylvania/maps/PAeco3.html |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=29 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the confluence of the [[Allegheny River]] from the northeast and [[Monongahela River]] from the southeast form the [[Ohio River]]. The Downtown area between the rivers is known as the [[Golden Triangle (Pittsburgh)|Golden Triangle]], and the site at the actual convergence, which is occupied by [[Point State Park]], is referred to simply as &quot;the Point.&quot; In addition to the downtown Golden Triangle, the city extends northeast to include the [[Oakland (Pittsburgh)|Oakland]] and [[Shadyside (Pittsburgh)|Shadyside]] sections, which are home to the [[University of Pittsburgh]], [[Carnegie Mellon University]], [[Chatham University]], [[Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh|Carnegie Museum]] and [[Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh|Library]], and many other educational, medical, and cultural institutions.

Many of the city's [[list of Pittsburgh neighborhoods|neighborhoods]] are steeply sloped, with two-lane roads. The names of more than a quarter of Pittsburgh's neighborhoods make reference to &quot;hills,&quot; &quot;heights,&quot; or other indicators of topographical complexity.&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;The neighborhoods are [[Arlington Heights (Pittsburgh)|Arlington Heights]], [[Bluff (Pittsburgh)|Bluff]], [[Brighton Heights (Pittsburgh)|Brighton Heights]], [[Crafton Heights (Pittsburgh)|Crafton Heights]], [[Duquesne Heights (Pittsburgh)|Duquesne Heights]], [[East Hills (Pittsburgh)|East Hills]], [[Fineview (Pittsburgh)|Fineview]], [[Highland Park (Pittsburgh)|Highland Park]], [[Middle Hill (Pittsburgh)|Middle Hill]], [[Mount Oliver (Pittsburgh)|Mount Oliver]], [[Mount Washington (Pittsburgh)|Mount Washington]], [[Northview Heights (Pittsburgh)|Northview Heights]], [[Perry North (Pittsburgh)|Perry North]] (also known as Observatory Hill), [[Perry South (Pittsburgh)|Perry South]] (also known as Perry Hilltop), [[Polish Hill (Pittsburgh)|Polish Hill]], [[Ridgemont (Pittsburgh)|Ridgemont]], [[South Side Slopes (Pittsburgh)|South Side Slopes]], [[Spring Hill–City View (Pittsburgh)|Spring Hill-City View]], [[Squirrel Hill (Pittsburgh)|Squirrel Hill]], [[Stanton Heights (Pittsburgh)|Stanton Heights]], [[Summer Hill (Pittsburgh)|Summer Hill]], [[Troy Hill (Pittsburgh)|Troy Hill]], and [[Upper Hill (Pittsburgh)|Upper Hill]].&lt;/ref&gt;

This topography is often used for physical activity. The city has some 712 sets of [[Steps of Pittsburgh|stairs]], comprising 44,645 treads and 24,090 vertical feet for pedestrians to traverse its many hills. There are hundreds of 'paper streets' composed entirely of stairs and many other steep streets with stairs for sidewalks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] |title=Learning the steps: Pitt researcher fell for city's stairs and has published a book that maps them |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/04076/286278.stm |date=March 16, 2004 |author=Patricia Lowry}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many provide views of the Pittsburgh area.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Steps of Pittsburgh: Portrait of a City&quot; ''by Bob Regan, photos by Tim Fabian, published by The Local History Company, Pittsburgh, ISBN 978-0-9711835-6-8''&lt;/ref&gt;

The city has established bike and walking trails along its riverfronts and hollows, but steep hills and variable weather can make [[Cycling|biking]] challenging. However, the city is connected to downtown Washington, D.C. (some {{convert|245|mi|km}} away) by a continuous bike/running trail through the Alleghenies and along the Potomac Valley, known as the [[Great Allegheny Passage]] and [[Chesapeake and Ohio Canal]] Towpath.

The city reported very little damage but widely felt the shaking from the [[2011 Virginia earthquake]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/local/breaking/earthquake-shakes-region-buildings-evacuated-311470/ Earthquake shakes region; buildings evacuated - Pittsburgh Post-Gazette].

=== Climate ===
Pittsburgh lies in the transition between a [[humid continental]] and [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Dfa/Cfa''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Peel, M. C. and Finlayson, B. L. and McMahon, T. A. | year=2007 | title= Updated world map of the Köppen-Geiger climate classification | journal=Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci. | volume=11 | pages=1633–1644 | url=http://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/11/1633/2007/hess-11-1633-2007.html | issn = 1027-5606}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it lies much closer to the former. The city and urban river valley locations lie in the USDA plant hardiness zone 6b and distant suburban and higher elevated areas lie in zone 6a. It features four distinct seasons, with precipitation somewhat evenly spread throughout the year. Summers are hot and humid (with occasional [[heat wave]]s), while winters are cold and snowy. Spring and autumn are generally unstable yet mild. 

The warmest month of the year in Pittsburgh is July, with a 24-hour average of {{convert|72.6|°F|1}}. Conditions are often humid, and combined with highs reaching {{convert|90|°F}} on an average 9.5 days per annum,&lt;ref name= NOAA /&gt; a considerable [[heat index]] arises. The coldest month is January, when the 24-hour average is {{convert|28.4|°F|1}}, and sub-zero lows (≤ −18 °C) can be expected on an average 2.6 nights per year.&lt;ref name = NOAA /&gt; Extremes in temperature range from [[1994 North American cold wave|{{convert|-22|°F}}, on January 19, 1994]] to {{convert|103|°F}}, which last occurred on July 16, 1988.

Total precipitation is greatest in May and least in October, and the average annual precipitation is {{convert|38.1|in|mm}}, yet, on average, December and January have the greatest number of days with precipitation. Snowfall averages {{convert|41.5|in|cm}} per season. In terms of cloudiness, there is an average of 59 clear days and 103 partly cloudy days per year, while 203 days are cloudy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/online/ccd/cldy.html|title=Cloudiness – Mean Number of Days|date=August 20, 2008|publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]|accessdate=May 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of annual percent-average possible sunshine received, Pittsburgh (45%) is similar to [[Seattle]] (43%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/online/ccd/pctposrank.txt|title=RANKING OF CITIES BASED ON % ANNUAL POSSIBLE SUNSHINE IN DESCENDING ORDER FROM MOST TO LEAST AVERAGE POSSIBLE SUNSHINE |publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]|accessdate=May 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Pittsburgh generally experiences moderate weather, a few extreme weather events occurred between 1990 and 2010. The [[Blizzard of 1993]] dumped over {{convert|23|in|cm}} of snow in under 24 hours, and the [[First North American blizzard of 2010]] (locally known as &quot;Snowpocalypse&quot; and &quot;Snowmageddon&quot;) dumped nearly {{convert|2|ft|cm}} of snow in less than 24 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.city.pittsburgh.pa.us/pw/html/blizzard_of_1993.html|title=Blizzard of 1993|publisher=Pittsburgh Public Works|accessdate=June 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2010: A Pittsburgh Snow Odyssey|url=http://www.wtae.com/weather/22687306/detail.html|publisher=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|accessdate=June 5, 2010}}{{dead link|date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Fujita scale|F2]] [[tornado]] entered city limits on [[1998 Eastern tornado outbreak|June 2, 1998]]. In September 2004, the remnants of [[Hurricane Ivan]] brought gusty winds and dropped nearly {{convert|6|in|mm}} of rain in 12 hours.

====Air and water quality====
In a 2013 ranking of 277 metropolitan areas in the United States, the [[American Lung Association]] ranked six other U.S. metro areas as having higher amounts of short-term particle pollution and seven other U.S. metro areas having higher amounts of year-round particle pollution. Ozone (smog) pollution ranked 23 U.S. metro areas as having greater amounts than the  [[Pittsburgh metropolitan area|Pittsburgh region]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stateoftheair.org/2013/city-rankings/most-polluted-cities.html American Lung Association State of the Air 2013 - Most Polluted Cities]. Stateoftheair.org. Retrieved on 2013-07-17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/local/neighborhoods-city/report-pittsburghs-air-quality-improving-but-still-among-most-polluted-684783/ Report: Pittsburgh's air quality improving, but still among most polluted - Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]. Post-gazette.com (2013-04-24). Retrieved on 2013-07-17.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the area has improved its air quality with every annual survey the American Lung Association's rankings have been disputed by the Allegheny County Health Department, since data from only one of the region's 20 air quality monitors is considered by the ALA, without any context or averaging. Furthermore, the lone monitor used is located immediately downwind and adjacent to U.S. Steel's Clairton Coke Works, the nation's largest [[Coke (fuel)|coke]] plant and several municipalities outside the city limits of jurisdiction and pollution controls, leading to possible confusion that Pittsburgh itself is the source or center of the emissions used for the survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Pittsburgh Tribune Review]]|title=Region passes L.A. on pollution list|accessdate=August 10, 2008|last=Heinrichs|first=Allison|url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/cityregion/s_565183.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the county was still below the &quot;pass&quot; threshold, the report demonstrated substantial improvement compared to previous decades on every measure of air quality. For example, there were more than 40 high ozone days reported between 1997 and 1999, a figure which fell to fewer than 15 between 2007 and 2009 and just 10 between 2008 and 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stateoftheair.org/2012/msas/Pittsburgh-New-Castle-PA.html|title=Allegheny County and Pittsburgh-New Castle, PA|year=2012|work=State of the Air 2011|publisher=American Lung Association|accessdate=May 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Allegheny County Health Department also notes this improvement in air quality. Department spokesman Guillermo Cole stated that &quot;It's the best it's been in the lifetime for virtually every resident in this county...We've seen a steady decrease in pollution levels over the past decade and certainly over the past 20, 30, 40, 50 years or more.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wpxi.com/news/23287732/detail.html|title=Pittsburgh Air Quality No Longer Worst In U.S.|date=April 28, 2010|publisher=[[WPXI]]|accessdate=May 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The local rivers have shown great improvement though continue to have levels of mercury and other pollutants exceeding EPA limits. Comparatively fish catches in the city in 2007 were found to be more than twice as free of pollutants than fish catches on the Canadian side of [[Lake Erie]] and six times as free of pollutants than New York border area [[Allegheny River]] fish catches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Pitt Chronicle]]|title=Something Fishy in Pittsburgh: Studies Suggest Water Pollution Still Pervasive|accessdate=April 24, 2012|last=Collins|first=Clare|url=http://www.chronicle.pitt.edu/?p=1044}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these relatively positive results, there are concerns about local storm sewers and waste treatment plants  [[Allegheny County Sanitary Authority#Pittsburgh's sewer overflow problem|frequently overflowing untreated sewage]] into local waterways due to flood conditions and antiquated infrastructure.

The city boasts 31,000 trees on 900 miles of streets, by the last count conducted in 2005. A 2011 analysis of Pittsburgh’s total tree cover, which involved sampling more than 200 small plots throughout the city, showed a value of between $10 and $13 million in annual benefits based on the &quot;urban forest&quot; contributions to aesthetics, energy use and air quality. Energy savings from shade, impact on city air and water quality and the boost in property values were taken into account in the analysis. The city spends $850,000/year on street tree planting and maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nextcity.org/daily/entry/that-tree-on-the-corner-may-be-worth-more-than-your-house Tree on the Corner May Be Worth More Than Your House – Next City].

The city can be broken down into the Downtown area, called the Golden Triangle,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emporis.com/borough/goldentriangle-pittsburgh |title=Golden Triangle (Pittsburgh) |publisher=Emporis.com |accessdate=April 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and four main areas surrounding it. These four surrounding areas are further subdivided into distinct neighborhoods (in total, Pittsburgh contains 90 neighborhoods).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.city.pittsburgh.pa.us/portal/neighborhoods.html |accessdate=July 17, 2007 |title=Pittsburgh Neighborhoods |work=City of Pittsburgh Portal}}&lt;/ref&gt; These areas, relative to downtown, are known as the North Side, South Side/South Hills, East End, and West End.

[[Downtown Pittsburgh]] is tight and compact, featuring many skyscrapers, nine of which top {{convert|500|ft|m}}. [[U.S. Steel Tower]] is the tallest at 841&amp;nbsp;ft (256 m).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emporis.com/building/us-steel-tower-pittsburgh-pa-usa |title=U.S. Steel Tower, Pittsburgh |work=Emporis Buildings |accessdate=July 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cultural District, Pittsburgh|Cultural District]] comprises a 14-block area of downtown along the Allegheny River. It is packed with theaters and arts venues, and is seeing a growing residential segment. Most significantly, the [[Pittsburgh Cultural Trust]] is embarking on Riverparc, a four-block mixed-use &quot;green&quot; community, featuring 700 residential units and multiple towers between 20 and 30 stories. The Firstside portion of downtown borders the Monongahela River and the historic Mon Wharf. This area is home to the distinctive [[PPG Place]] Gothic glass skyscraper complex. This area too, is seeing a growing residential sector, as new condo towers are constructed and historic office towers are converted to residential use. Downtown is serviced by the [[Port Authority of Allegheny County|Port Authority]]'s [[Pittsburgh light rail|light rail]] and multiple bridges leading north and south.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portauthority.org/PAAC/Portals/Capital/NorthShore/images/big-new-map.JPG JPG map]. portauthority.org&lt;/ref&gt; It is also home to [[Point Park University]], [[The Art Institute of Pittsburgh]], Pittsburgh Culinary Institute, a former [[Robert Morris University]] branch campus (bought by Duquesne University in 2011) and [[Duquesne University]] which is located on the border of Downtown and Uptown.

[[File:Buena vista.JPG|thumb|left|Pittsburgh's Central North Side Neighborhood]]

The North Side is home to various neighborhoods in transition. What is known today as Pittsburgh's North Side was once known as Allegheny City and operated as a city independently of Pittsburgh. Allegheny City merged with Pittsburgh under great protest from its citizens. The [[Northside (Pittsburgh)|North Side]] is primarily composed of residential neighborhoods and is noteworthy for well-constructed and architecturally interesting homes. Many buildings date from the 19th century and are constructed of brick or stone and adorned with decorative woodwork, ceramic tile, slate roofs and stained glass. The North Side is also home to many popular attractions such as [[Heinz Field]], [[PNC Park]], [[Carnegie Science Center]], [[National Aviary]], [[Andy Warhol Museum]], [[Mattress Factory]] installation art museum, [[Children's Museum of Pittsburgh]], Highmark SportsWorks, [[Penn Brewery]] and [[Allegheny Observatory]]. The North Side is also home to Allegheny General Hospital, listed among the 1999 US News &amp; World Report 2000 best hospitals nationwide.

The South Side was once an area composed primarily of dense inexpensive housing for mill workers, but has in recent years become a local Pittsburgher destination. The South Side is one of the most popular neighborhoods in which to own a home in Pittsburgh. The value of homes in the South Side has increased in value by about 10% annually{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} for the past 10 years. The [[South Side (Pittsburgh)|South Side]]'s East Carson Street is one of the most vibrant areas of the city, packed with diverse shopping, ethnic eateries, pulsing nightlife and live music venues. In 1993 the [[Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh]] purchased the South Side Works steel mill property, and worked together with the community and various developers to create a master plan for a mixed-use development including a riverfront park, office space, housing, health-care facilities, and the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] and [[Pitt Panthers]] indoor practice fields. Construction began in 1998, and the [[Southside Works]] is now open for business with many store, restaurants, offices, and the world headquarters for [[American Eagle Outfitters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2005_Oct_21/ai_n15726879 |title=American Eagle Outfitters Announces Pittsburgh's SouthSide Works Location As New Corporate Headquarters |date=October 21, 2005 |accessdate=October 21, 2007 |work=[[Business Wire]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The East End is home to the [[University of Pittsburgh]], [[Carnegie Mellon University]], [[Carlow University]], [[Chatham University]], [[Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh|The Carnegie Institute's Museums of Art and Natural History]], [[Frick Art &amp; Historical Center]] (Clayton and the Frick art museum), [[Phipps Conservatory]], [[Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall]], and the [[Pittsburgh Zoo|Pittsburgh Zoo and PPG Aquarium]]. The neighborhoods of [[Shadyside (Pittsburgh)|Shadyside]] and [[Squirrel Hill]] are large, wealthy neighborhoods featuring large shopping/business districts. [[Oakland (Pittsburgh)|Oakland]], heavily populated by undergraduate and graduate students, is home to most of the universities, [[Schenley Park]] and the [[Petersen Events Center]]. [[Bloomfield (Pittsburgh)|Bloomfield]] is Pittsburgh's Little Italy and is known for its Italian restaurants and grocers. [[Lawrenceville (Pittsburgh)|Lawrenceville]] is a revitalizing rowhouse neighborhood popular with artists and designers, which is expected to benefit from the recent new construction of a new Children's Hospital. The [[Strip District]] is an open-air marketplace by day and a clubbing destination by night.

The West End includes [[Mount Washington (Pittsburgh)|Mt. Washington]], with its famous view of the Downtown skyline and numerous other residential neighborhoods like [[Sheraden (Pittsburgh)|Sheraden]] and [[Elliott (Pittsburgh)|Elliott]].

Pittsburgh's patchwork of neighborhoods still retain an ethnic character reflecting the city's immigrant history. These include:
* ''German'': [[Troy Hill (Pittsburgh)|Troy Hill]], [[Mount Washington (Pittsburgh)|Mt. Washington]], and [[East Allegheny (Pittsburgh)|East Allegheny]] (Deutschtown)

The growth of Pittsburgh and its economy was caused by the extensive trade in steel through the 1970s. Pittsburgh has since adapted to the collapse of the region's steel industry. The primary industries have shifted more to high technology, such as [[robotics]], health care, nuclear engineering, tourism, [[biomedical technology]], finance, and services. As of 2007, the total annual payroll of the region's technology industries, when taken in aggregate, exceeded $10.8 billion,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pghtech.org/aboutus/about-our-region.aspx About Our Region] Pittsburgh Technology Council&lt;/ref&gt; and as of 2010, there were 1,600 technology companies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bobkoff&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/2010/12/16/131907405/from-steel-to-tech-pittsburgh-transforms-itself|title=From Steel To Tech, Pittsburgh Transforms Itself|last=Bobkoff|first=Dan|date=December 16, 2010|work=[[NPR]]|accessdate=December 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reflecting the citywide shift from industry to technology, some former factories have been directly renovated into modern office space.

All hospitals, outpatient clinics, and doctor's office positions combine for 116,000 jobs, approximately 10% of the jobs in the region. An analyst recently observed of the city's medical sector: &quot;That's both more jobs and a higher share of the region's total employment than the steel industry represented in the 1970s.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pittsburghfuture.blogspot.com/2010/12/thank-seniors-for-helping-us-get.html|title=Pittsburgh's Future: Thank Seniors for Helping Us Get Through the Recession|last=Miller|first=Harold D.|date=December 5, 2010|work=Pittsburgh's Future: Making Southwestern Pennsylvania One of the World's Greatest Regions|accessdate=December 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th and 20th centuries, wealthy businessmen and nonprofit organizations donated millions of dollars to create educational and cultural institutions. As a result, Pittsburgh is rich in art and culture.

Among the professional music venues, the [[Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra]] performs in [[Heinz Hall]], and the [[Pittsburgh Opera]] performs in the [[Benedum Center]]. Both The Benedum Center and Heinz Hall provide venues for other groups, such as the [[River City Brass Band]] and the Pittsburgh Youth Symphony Orchestra. Pittsburgh has a long tradition of jazz, blues and bluegrass music. Additionally the National Negro Opera Company was founded in Pittsburgh, and was the first all African-American opera company in the United States. This led to the prominence of African-American singers like [[Leontyne Price]] in the world of opera. Pittsburgh has a number of small and mid-size arts organizations supported by individuals, local foundations, and the Allegheny Regional Asset District. Examples include [[Pittsburgh Irish and Classical Theatre]], [[Quantum Theatre]], the [[Renaissance and Baroque Society of Pittsburgh]], and the early music ensemble Chatham Baroque.

In stark contrast to the Romero-Savini type product, Pittsburgh's position as the birthplace for community owned television and networked commercial television helped spawn the modern children's show genres exemplified by ''[[Mister Rogers' Neighborhood]]'', ''[[Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego? (TV series)|Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?]]'', ''[[Happy's Party]]'', ''[[Cappelli &amp; Company]]'' and ''[[The Children's Corner]]'', all nationally broadcast.

The ''[[Pittsburgh Dad]]'' series has since 2011 applied traditional [[Pittsburghese]] genre to a global [[Youtube]] audience.

===Local dialect===
{{Main|Pittsburgh English}}

The Pittsburgh English dialect, commonly called ''[[Pittsburghese]]'', was influenced by [[Scots-Irish American|Scots-Irish]], [[Welsh people|Welsh]], [[Germans|German]], [[Central Europe]]an and [[Eastern European]] immigrants. Locals who speak the dialect are sometimes referred to as &quot;[[Yinzer]]s&quot; (from the local word &quot;yinz&quot; [var. ''yunz''], a blended form of &quot;you ones&quot;, similar to &quot;y'all&quot; and &quot;you all&quot; in the South). Common Pittsburghese terms are: slippy (slippery), redd up (clean up), and gum bands (rubber bands). The dialect is also notable for dropping the verb &quot;to be&quot;. In Pittsburghese, for example, one would say &quot;the car needs washed&quot; instead of &quot;needs to be washed&quot;, &quot;needs washing&quot;, or &quot;needs a wash&quot;. The dialect has some tonal similarities to other nearby regional dialects (e.g., Erie, Baltimore), but is noted for its somewhat [[staccato]] rhythms. The staccato qualities of the Pittsburgh dialect have been suggested to originate either from Welsh or from Eastern European immigrants. It has so many local peculiarities that the ''[[New York Times]]'' described Pittsburgh as, &quot;the Galapagos Islands of American dialect.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://travel2.nytimes.com/2006/03/17/travel/escapes/17accent.html?pagewanted=2 | page = 2 | title = It's Not the Sights, It's the Sounds | date = March 17, 2006 | accessdate =August 14, 2007 | last = Sultan | first = Tim |work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lexicon itself contains notable loans from [[Polish language|Polish]] and other [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] and European languages; examples include [[headscarf|babushka]], [[pierogi]], and [[halušky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://pittsburghspeech.pitt.edu/PittsburghSpeech_SpeechOverview.html | title = Overview | work = Pittsburgh Speech and Society | accessdate =August 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Livability===
[[File:Pittsburgh WEO Night 1.jpg|thumb|Night view of Pittsburgh from the [[West End Overlook]]]]
Pittsburgh often places high in lists of the nation's most livable cities. After placing fourth and first in the first two editions of ''Places Rated Almanac'', Pittsburgh finished third in 1989, fifth in 1993, 14th in 1997 and 12th in 2000, before reclaiming the number one spot in 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;PlacesRated&quot;/&gt; The survey's primary author, David Savageau, has noted that Pittsburgh is the only city to finish in the top 20 of every edition.

In 2005, 2009 and 2011, Pittsburgh was named most livable city in the United States and in those years, between the 26th and 29th most livable city worldwide by ''[[The Economist]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;economist2011&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/09161/976252-53.stm | title = Pittsburgh ranked tops in U.S. by The Economist | work = [[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] | date = June 10, 2009 | accessdate =June 10, 2009 | last = Carpenter | first = Mackenzie }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pittsburgh ranked No. 28 in the book ''Cities Ranked and Rated'' (2004) by [[Bert Sperling]] and Peter Sander.

Livability rankings typically consider factors such as cost of living, crime, and cultural opportunities. Pittsburgh has a low cost of living compared to other cities in the northeastern U.S. The average price for a 3- to 4-bedroom, 2-bath family home in Pittsburgh is $162,000, which is well below the national average of $264,540, as of October 2004, according to the Federal Housing Finance Board. In addition, average rent for all bedrooms in Pittsburgh was $789 at the end of the first quarter of 2010. This compares to the nationwide average of $1087.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rentjungle.com/average-rent-in-pittsburgh-rent-trends/.html|title=Rent Jungle Statistics|accessdate =October 18, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another factor enhancing Pittsburgh's livability is that area residents face very little risk of encountering a natural disaster such as an earthquake, hurricane, wildfire, or tornado. In 2009, Forbes ranked Pittsburgh as having the second lowest natural disaster risk in the nation compared to other cities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenburg 2009&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.forbes.com/2009/10/26/safest-cities-ten-lifestyle-real-estate-metros-msa_chart.html?partner=yahoore|title=Full List: America's Safest Cities|last=Greenburg|first=Zack O'Malley|date=October 26, 2009|work=Forbes|accessdate=October 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pittsburgh metropolitan area|Greater Pittsburgh]] is not entirely free of natural disasters, however.

Pittsburgh narrowly falls within the borders of the [[Northeastern United States]] as defined by multiple agencies of the US Government, but the Pittsburgh [[Combined Statistical Area]] extends into both the [[Southern United States]] ([[West Virginia]]) and the [[Midwestern United States]] ([[Ohio]]) due to the fact that the borders of these three regions meet only {{convert|30|mi|km}} from the city proper. Pittsburgh also belongs to the [[Great Lakes Megalopolis]], a collection of primarily Midwestern cities like Detroit, Chicago, and Cleveland. This classification reflects the fact that Pittsburgh is more economically connected to Ohio than it is to the eastern half of Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name=&quot;Briem PG 2011&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Petrucci 2013&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.keystoneedge.com/features/dollarsmovingpennsylvania0411.aspx|title=Tracking Dollars Spent, New Map Shows a Divided Pennsylvania|last=Petrucci|first=Joe|date=11 April 2013|publisher=Keystone Edge|accessdate=31 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pittsburgh also falls within the borders of [[Appalachia]] as defined by the [[Appalachian Regional Commission]]. Before the city transitioned from an industrial economy to a service economy, it was characterized as the &quot;northern urban industrial anchor of Appalachia&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;ScarpaciPatrick2006&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scarpaci|first1=Joseph L.|last2=Patrick|first2=Kevin Joseph|title=Pittsburgh and the Appalachians: cultural and natural resources in a postindustrial age|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=9qTdSl2CkzkC|accessdate=February 3, 2011|date=June 28, 2006|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Pre|isbn=978-0-8229-4282-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;:167&lt;/sup&gt; a designation which made it an anomaly compared to much of Appalachia in the 20th century, which was traditionally characterized as southern, rural, and economically distressed.&lt;ref name=&quot;ScarpaciPatrick2006&quot;/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;:167&lt;/sup&gt; In its post-industrial state, Pittsburgh has now been characterized as the &quot;Paris of Appalachia&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Neill 2009&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Behe 2006&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/s_429269.html|title=Steel city an unlikely haven for writers|last=Behe|first=Regis|date=March 3, 2006|work=[[Pittsburgh Tribune-Review]]|accessdate=February 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Optimist&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/cavaliers/features/optimist_pittsburgh_101013.html|title=CAVALIERS: The Optimist|work=[[National Basketball Association]]|accessdate=February 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Watson 2010&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyfinance.com/2010/12/02/the-11-best-cities-for-telecommuters/|title=America's 11 Best Cities for Telecommuters|last=Watson|first=Bruce|date=December 2, 2010|work=DailyFinance|accessdate=February 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Navfin 2010&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://navfin.blogspot.com/2010/12/is-paris-of-appalachia-most-livable.html|title=Is The Paris of Appalachia The Most Livable City?|date=December 11, 2010|work=Navigating the Finite|accessdate=February 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; recognizing the city's cultural resources such as the [[Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh]], the [[Pittsburgh Symphony]], and the [[Pittsburgh Opera]], as well as its service economy built upon education, healthcare, and technology.  Pittsburgh is by far the largest metropolitan area in Appalachia proper.  The next largest metropolitan area is [[Birmingham, Alabama]], which is about half of Pittsburgh's size.

===Cultural===
While the city's status as an Appalachian city is largely undisputed, the city has been described as not belonging culturally to any of the major &quot;regions&quot; of the United States such as the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] or the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]].&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Neill 2009&quot;/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;:13&lt;/sup&gt; Pittsburgh lies only a few dozen miles from the spot where the physical boundaries of three major regions of the United States converge ({{Coord|40|38|19.67|N|80|31|8.37|W|region:US|display=inline}}), namely the Northeastern United States, the [[Midwestern United States]], and the Southern United States,&lt;ref name=&quot;Regional boundaries&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/us_regdiv.pdf|title=Census Regions and Divisions of the United States|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=July 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in straddling these boundaries, it borrows cultural influences from a variety of sources.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Joseph Scarpaci, [[professor emeritus]] of geography at [[Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University|Virginia Tech]], has described Pittsburgh as having &quot;one foot in the East...and the other in the Midwest&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ScarpaciPatrick2006&quot;/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;:1&lt;/sup&gt; In his 2009 book ''The Paris of Appalachia'', [[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] writer Brian O'Neill meditates on this aspect of Pittsburgh's regional and cultural ambiguity. The title of the book is intentionally provocative:&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The Paris of Appalachia&quot; some have called Pittsburgh derisively, because it's still the largest city along this gorgeous mountain chain that needs a better press agent. I've long felt we should embrace that title, though few are with me. Several tried to talk me out of slapping it on the cover, but were we called &quot;The Paris of the Rockies,&quot; we wouldn't run from it. Sometimes we're so afraid of what others think, we're afraid to say who we are. This city is not Midwestern. It's not East Coast. It's just Pittsburgh, and there's no place like it. That's both its blessing and its curse.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Neill 2009&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Neill|first=Brian|title=The Paris of Appalachia: Pittsburgh in the Twenty-first Century|year=2009|publisher=[[Carnegie Mellon University Press]]|isbn=978-0-88748-509-1|accessdate=17 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;:13&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Economic===
Historically, Pittsburgh has been grouped in the &quot;[[rust belt]]&quot;;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mostrous2009&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/09/23/AR2009092304713.html|title=Pittsburgh, Site of G-20 Summit, Is Shaking Off Its Smoky Image|last=Mostrous|first=Alexi|date=September 24, 2009|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=February 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, reflective of the rebound of the region within the last generation, the metro area has come to be associated with the newly rebranded &quot;[[Great Lakes Basin]]&quot; gaining representation in the Great Lakes Metro Chamber Coalition,&lt;ref name=&quot;GLMCC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://greatlakesmetrochambers.com/WhoWeAre.aspx|title=Who we are|work=Great Lakes Metro Chambers Coalition|accessdate=February 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the &quot;America 2050&quot; organization claims that Pittsburgh is one of the &quot;principal cities&quot; of the [[Great Lakes Megalopolis]]&lt;ref name=&quot;America 2050&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.america2050.org/great_lakes.html|title=Great Lakes – America 2050|work=America 2050|accessdate=February 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite the fact that the city is about {{convert|120|mi|km}} from [[Lake Erie]].

Pittsburgh's association with the [[Great Lakes region (North America)|Great Lakes region]] is due in part to its economic, demographic and commuter connections to Great Lakes cities like [[Cleveland]], [[Erie, Pennsylvania|Erie]], [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]] and even [[Detroit]]. Christopher Briem, an economist at the [[University of Pittsburgh]]'s University Center for Social and Urban Research, has noted that southwestern Pennsylvania is &quot;far more interconnected&quot; with northeastern Ohio than it is with the eastern half of Pennsylvania, and that the industries of Pittsburgh are primarily linked to Ohioan cities such as [[Youngstown, Ohio|Youngstown]], [[Akron, Ohio|Akron]], and [[Cleveland]], not to Pennsylvanian cities such as [[Allentown, Pennsylvania|Allentown]], [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]], or [[Philadelphia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Briem PG 2011&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/11002/1114678-109.stm|title=Welcome to Cleveburgh! Pittsburghers need to rethink their place in the world|last=Briem|first=Christopher|date=January 2, 2011|work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|accessdate=January 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He notes that, conversely, the population centers of northeastern Ohio are primarily connected with Pittsburgh and only secondarily connected to the state capital of [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]]. Briem argues that &quot;In so many ways the state boundaries we think of as important are no more than lines on a map.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Briem PG 2011&quot;/&gt; In recognizing their economic interdependence, Briem has popularized the term &quot;Cleveburgh&quot; to refer collectively to the cities of Cleveland and Pittsburgh, along with the smaller towns dotting the corridor of [[Interstate 76 (east)|I-76]] between the cities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Briem PG 2011&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Briem Turnpike 2011&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nullspace2.blogspot.com/2011/01/turnpike-runs-through-it.html|title=A Turnpike Runs Through It|last=Briem|first=Christopher|date=January 2, 2011|work=Null Space|accessdate=February 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Briem PD 2011&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cleveland.com/opinion/index.ssf/2011/01/residents_of_cleveland_and_pit.html|title=Residents of Cleveland and Pittsburgh need to rethink their place in the world|last=Briem|first=Christopher|date=January 22, 2011|work=[[The Plain Dealer]]|accessdate=February 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Roman 2011&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cleveland.com/opinion/index.ssf/2011/01/tech_belt_initiative_helps_are.html|title=Tech Belt Initiative helps area compete in global markets: |last=Roman|first=Joe|coauthors=Dennis Yablonsky|date=January 23, 2011|publisher=The Plain Dealer|accessdate=October 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Crain's 2007&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.crainscleveland.com/article/20070423/SUB/70420005|title=Cleveburgh|date=April 23, 2007|publisher=[[Crain's Cleveland Business]]|accessdate=October 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Lang and Arthur Nelson of the Metropolitan Institute at [[Virginia Tech]] also identify the region between Cleveland and Pittsburgh as being an interconnected &quot;megapolitan area&quot; and refer to it as the &quot;Steel Corridor&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lang and Nelson 2007&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lang|first=Robert E.|coauthors=Arthur C.

The scope of Pittsburgh's metropolitan influence on the surrounding area is of more than just academic interest. For example, the organization &quot;Power of 32&quot; focuses on addressing the issues of the 32-county metropolitan area roughly centered on Pittsburgh—a region which includes portions of Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, and Maryland. Despite being divided into four states and three Census Bureau—defined regions, this area functions as an interdependent economic region.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carlisle 2011&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/11020/1119147-56.stm|title=A newsmaker you should know: He's expanding power of community|last=Carlisle|first=Anthony Todd|date=January 20, 2011|work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|accessdate=January 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Power of 32 asserts that &quot;[t]he 32-county region has common challenges and opportunities in the global economy, but is larger than the scope of any one single political entity, authority, or organization&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://powerof32.org/about-p32|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100722060536/http://powerof32.org/about-p32|archivedate=2010-07-22|title=About P32 | publisher = Power of 32 |accessdate=January 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that &quot;[t]he only thing we find at artificial boundaries are problems, not solutions.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.powerof32.org/get-informed|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100727023532/http://www.powerof32.org/get-informed|archivedate=2010-07-27|title=Get Informed. | publisher = Power of 32 |accessdate=January 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Power of 32 is supported in its efforts by &quot;30 to 40 other foundations&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Carlisle 2011&quot;/&gt; and funded by several Pittsburgh-area endowments including the [[Richard King Mellon]] Foundation and The [[H.

===Baseball===
[[File:Pedro goes to Pittsburgh.jpg|thumb|[[PNC Park]], home of the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]].]]
The [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] baseball team, often referred to as the Bucs or sometimes the Buccos (derived from [[buccaneer]]), is the city's oldest professional sports franchise having been founded in 1882, and plays in the [[National League Central|Central Division]] of the [[National League]]. The Pirates are nine-time National League Pennant winners and five-time [[World Series]] Champions. The Pirates played in the first [[1903 World Series|World's Series in 1903]], losing to the [[Boston Red Sox|Boston Americans]], and won in [[1909 World Series|1909]], [[1925 World Series|1925]], [[1960 World Series|1960]], [[1971 World Series|1971]], as well as in their most recent World Series appearance against the [[Baltimore Orioles]] in [[1979 World Series|1979]]. The team claims two pre-World Series titles in 1901 and 1902. The Pirates play in [[PNC Park]], which is annually ranked as one of the most beautiful Major League baseball parks because of its location on the banks of the Allegheny River and the view of the Pittsburgh skyline. An [[ESPN.com]] feature remarked that &quot;[t]his is the perfect blend of location, history, design, comfort and baseball…The best stadium in baseball is in Pittsburgh.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=ESPN |title=Pittsburgh's gem rates the best |url=http://espn.go.com/page2/s/ballparks/pncpark.html |author=Jim Caple |accessdate=July 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[PNC Park]] hosted the team's MLB record-tying fifth All-Star game in 2006. Pittsburgh also has a rich history in [[Negro League]] baseball teams with the former [[Pittsburgh Crawfords]] and the [[Homestead Grays]] credited with as many as 14 league titles and 11 Hall of Famers between them in the 1930s and 1940s while the [[Pittsburgh Keystones (baseball)|Keystones]] fielded teams in the 1920s. In addition, the Pirates were the first Major League team to field an all-nonwhite lineup in 1971. One sportswriter claimed, &quot;No city is more synonymous with black baseball than Pittsburgh.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=[[Beaver County Times]] |title=Baseball Plog|url=http://www.timesonline.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=17047895&amp;BRD=2305&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=478568&amp;rfi=6 |date=August 14, 2006 |author=[[John Perrotto]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pittsburgh Pirates also hold the MLB record for most consecutive losing seasons with 20 between their 3 straight [[National League Championship Series]] appearances in 1990, 1991 and 1992 (going 6, 7 and 7 games each) and their playoff qualifying 2013 season—despite a September pennant race in the [[1997 Pittsburgh Pirates season|1997 season]] that featured the franchises last no-hitter by a Pirates pitcher and last Pirates general manager to be named [[The Sporting News Executive of the Year Award|Sporting News' Executive of the Year]].&lt;ref&gt;http://archive.alexreisner.com/baseball/history/race?y=1997&lt;/ref&gt;

===Football===
{{details|American football in Western Pennsylvania}}
[[File:Heinz Field Pittsburgh.jpg|thumb|[[Heinz Field]], home of the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] and the [[Pittsburgh Panthers]] (football).]]
[[File:Homefield Advantage, Heinz Field.jpg|thumbnail|right|Heinz Field seen from a top Mount Washington.]]
[[American football|Football]] is the most popular and tradition laden sport in the region with the nation's first-ever professional game being played in the city on November 12, 1892, between the [[Allegheny Athletic Association]] and the [[Pittsburgh Athletic Club (football)|Pittsburgh Athletic Club]], as well as the first pro-team in nearby [[Latrobe, Pennsylvania|Latrobe]] and first organized league, the [[National Football League (1902)|NFL]] and their inaugural champions the [[Pittsburgh Stars]].

[[High school football|High school]] games routinely get over 10,000 fans per contest and extensive press coverage. The [[Tom Cruise]] film ''[[All the Right Moves (film)|All the Right Moves]]'' and ESPN's documentary ''[[Bound for Glory (ESPN)|Bound for Glory]]'' with [[Dick Butkus]] both filmed in the area to capture the tradition and passion high school football enjoys in the region. [[College football]] is also popular, with the local [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] (FBS) [[Pittsburgh Panthers football|Panthers]] of the University of Pittsburgh enjoying wide support.  Since its first season in 1890, the Panthers (commonly referred to as &quot;Pitt&quot;) claim nine [[NCAA Division I FBS National Football Championship|national championships]] and have qualified for four straight bowl games.  The team is among the newest members of an expanded [[Atlantic Coast Conference]].  Pittsburgh is the closest major city/media market to both [[Penn State Nittany Lions football|Penn State University]] and [[West Virginia Mountaineers football|West Virginia University]], with WVU considered part of the media market. Local universities Duquesne and Robert Morris have loyal fan bases that follow their lower [[NCAA Division I Football Championship|(FCS)]] teams. Duquesne, Carnegie Mellon University and [[Washington &amp; Jefferson College]] all posted major bowl games and AP Poll rankings from the 1920s to the 1940s as that era's equivalent of Top 25 FBS programs.

The most popular team in the city is the [[National Football League|NFL's]] [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]. The Steelers are more than a sports team to the region and its [[diaspora]]; many have noted that news of the team has preempted media coverage of elections and other major events. The Steelers have been owned by the [[Rooney family]] since the team's founding in 1933, show consistency in coaching (only three coaches since the 1960s all with the same basic philosophy) and are noted as one of sports' most respectable franchises on and off the field. The Steelers have a long waiting list for season tickets, and have sold out every home game since 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= ESPN ranks Steelers fans No. 1|url= http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/sports/steelers/s_585606.html?source=rss&amp;feed=3|publisher= Pittsburgh Tribune-Review|date= August 30, 2008|accessdate=August 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team won four [[Super Bowl]]s in a six-year span in the 1970s, a [[Super Bowl XL|fifth Super Bowl]] in 2006, and a league record [[Super Bowl XLIII|sixth Super Bowl]] in 2009. Since the AFL-NFL merger in 1970 they have qualified for more playoff berths (25) and have played in (15) and hosted (11) more conference championship games than any other NFL franchise. Heinz Field serves as the home field for both the Steelers and Pitt Panthers, as well as the title rounds of both the suburban and city high school football championships. Other professional football teams include the [[Pittsburgh Power]], an Arena Football team that began play at the [[Consol Energy Center]] in April 2011, and are heirs to the [[Pittsburgh Gladiators#Pittsburgh Gladiators (1987–1990)|Pittsburgh Gladiators]] who hosted [[ArenaBowl I]] in the city, competing in two total.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/sports/s_695755.html | title=Pittsburgh Power unveiled as arena football expansion team | first=Rob | last=Rossi | newspaper=Pittsburgh Tribune-Review | date=August 20, 2010 | accessdate=August 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pittsburgh Passion]] has been the city's professional women's football team since 2002 and plays its home games at [[Highmark Stadium]].  The city also boasted the [[Edward J. DeBartolo, Sr.|Ed Debartolo]] owned [[Pittsburgh Maulers]] featuring a [[Heisman Trophy]] winner in the mid-1980s.

===Ice hockey===
[[File:PensArena.jpg|thumb|[[Consol Energy Center]], current home of the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] (first opened for the 2010–2011 NHL season).]]
[[Ice hockey]] in Pittsburgh has become increasingly popular on both the amateur and professional levels during the last few decades of the 20th century, and has had a regional fan base since the semi-pro [[Pittsburgh Keystones (ice hockey)|Pittsburgh Keystones]] of the 1890s and the first decade of the 20th century. The world's first artificial ice rink debuted in Pittsburgh at [[Schenley Park Casino|Schenley Gardens]] in 1898 and was later improved at the [[Duquesne Gardens]]. In 1924, the city was awarded one of the NHL's first franchises on the strength of its back-to-back USAHA championship winning [[Pittsburgh Yellow Jackets]] featuring future Hall of Famers and a Stanley Cup winning coach. The NHL's [[Pittsburgh Pirates (hockey)|Pittsburgh Pirates]], who were the first Pittsburgh pro team to don the &quot;black and gold&quot;, made several Stanley Cup playoff runs and featured a future Hall of Famer. With the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, the Pirates folded from financial pressures, but hockey survived with the [[Pittsburgh Hornets]] farm team from the 1930s to 1967. The franchise qualified for the finals seven times and hoisted championship banners three times (1952, 1955, 1967); all in an era where only the &quot;original six&quot; were in the NHL and &quot;farm team&quot; talent (especially [[Calder Cup]] champions) exceeded the level on most modern day NHL playoff teams.

In 1967, the [[National Hockey League|NHL]] doubled its teams from six to twelve and the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] were born. The Penguins have won four [[Eastern Conference (NHL)|Eastern Conference]] championships (1991, 1992, 2008, and 2009) and three [[Stanley Cup]] championships in 1991, 1992, and 2009. The Penguins are owned by Hall of Famer [[Mario Lemieux]], a back-to-back playoffs MVP for the Pens from 1984 to 2006. From 1967 until 2010 they played their home games at one of the NHL's oldest venues, and the first retractable domed stadium in the world, [[Civic Arena (Pittsburgh)|Civic Arena]], or in local parlance &quot;The Igloo&quot;. The [[Consol Energy Center]] replaced the &quot;igloo&quot; in the 2010–2011 NHL season.

[[Robert Morris Colonials men's ice hockey|Robert Morris University]] fields a Division I college hockey team at the [[Island Sports Center]], and much like 100 years ago, Pittsburgh is a hotbed for semi-pro and amateur teams, with the success of the Penguins fanning interest in the sport. In 2013 the city hosted its first [[2013 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament|Frozen Four]] college championship with RMU as sponsor of the four [[ESPN]] televised games at Consol Energy Center.  The number of pro-grade ice rinks have increased in the region such as the [[Rostraver Ice Garden]] and [[Iceoplex at Southpointe]], and several native Pittsburgh players have entered the NHL recently citing the success of Pens in the 1980s and 1990s as spurring their interest in the sport.  Tier 1 AAA teams such as the Pittsburgh Hornets, Pittsburgh Junior Penguins, Pittsburgh Predators, and the Pittsburgh Viper Stars have all been in the top 50 rankings in the nation, with the Hornets ranked in the nation's top 20 for the last 7 years.

===Basketball===
[[Professional basketball]] has played a role in the city's sports landscape since the 1910s, with &quot;Monticello&quot; and &quot;Loendi&quot; winning [[Black Fives#Colored Basketball World's Champions|five national championships]] in the &quot;Black Fives&quot; league, the [[Pittsburgh Pirates (NBL)|Pirates/Raiders]] (1937-1945 in the [[National Basketball League (United States)|National Basketball League]]), the [[Pittsburgh Ironmen|Ironmen]] (1947-48 inaugural season of the [[NBA]]), the [[Pittsburgh Rens|Rens]] (early 1960s), the [[Pittsburgh Condors|Pipers/Condors]] (first [[American Basketball Association]] championship in 1968 and playing until 1972), the [[Pittsburgh Piranhas|Piranhas]] (CBA Finals in 1995), and recently the [[Pittsburgh Xplosion|Xplosion]] and [[Pittsburgh Phantoms (ABA)|Phantoms]] (both of the [[American Basketball Association (2000–present)|ABA]]). Despite not having a current NBA franchise the city has hosted dozens of pre-season and 15 regular season &quot;neutral site&quot; NBA games, including  [[Wilt Chamberlain]]'s record setting performance in both consecutive field goals and field goal percentage on February 24, 1967, NBA records that still stand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nba.com/history/records/regular_fieldgoals.html Regular Season Records: Field Goals].

Collegiate basketball's fanbase was fueled since the early 20th century by the [[Duquesne Dukes men's basketball|Dukes]] of Duquesne University and the [[Pittsburgh Panthers men's basketball|Panthers]] of the University of Pittsburgh. During the 1940s to the 1970s, Duquesne was the city's most successful men's college basketball program. Appearing in the 1940 [[Final Four]], the Dukes were the city's first college basketball team to obtain a number one ranking in the [[AP Poll]] in 1954,&lt;ref&gt;See page 67 of the [http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/stats/m_basketball_RB/2009/D1.pdf NCAA Men's College Basketball Records] (PDF file)&lt;/ref&gt; and first to win a post-season college basketball tournament, the [[1955 National Invitation Tournament|1955 NIT]], its second straight trip to the NIT title game. Duquesne became the first and still only college program to produce back-to-back NBA #1 overall draft picks with 1955's Dick Ricketts and 1956's Sihugo Green. Duquesne's [[Chuck Cooper (basketball)|Chuck Cooper]] also became the first African American drafted by an NBA team in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nba.com/history/season/19501951.html NBA's Color Line Is Broken]. NBA.com. Retrieved on 2013-07-17.&lt;/ref&gt; The Pitt Panthers won two pre-tournament era  [[Helms Athletic Foundation]] [[Mythical national championship|National Championships]] in 1928 and 1930, competed in a &quot;national title game&quot; against [[LSU Tigers basketball|LSU]] in 1935, and made a Final Four appearance in 1941. Since joining the Big East Conference in 1982, Pitt has regularly found a place among the top 25 NCAA teams, including a number one ranking for several weeks in 2009, and has made qualified for 12 straight post-season national tournaments, making the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Men's basketball tournament]] in 10 of the last 11 seasons with an [[Elite Eight]] appearance in 2009. Pitt plays at the [[Peterson Events Center]], which has been sold out every season since its opening in 2002. The school's student section refers to itself as the &quot;[[Oakland Zoo (cheering section)|Oakland Zoo]]&quot;, a reference to the Oakland section of the city where the university is located. Pitt and Duquesne play a heated inter-city rivalry, termed &quot;[[City Game|The City Game]]&quot;, each season.

Since the 1970s, the suburban ([[Moon Township, Pennsylvania|Moon Township]]) based [[Robert Morris Colonials men's basketball|Robert Morris University's Colonials]] have also competed in NCAA Division I basketball qualifying for the NCAA Tournament each of the last four decades, including in 2010, while posting several conference titles. All three programs schedule out-of-conference games with each other most seasons.

Pittsburgh launched the nation's first high school all-star game, the [[Roundball Classic]]. Future NBA hall of famers and other greats competed in the Classic, annually held at the Civic Arena from 1965 until 1992 with  [[Nike Inc.|Nike]] and [[Asics]] as sponsors, [[ESPN]] televising and a record attendance of 17,000 in 1979. The Civic Arena also was the host of the  [[Atlantic 10 Men's Basketball Tournament|Eastern Eight College Basketball Conference Tournament]] from 1978 until 1982.

===Golf===
[[Golf]] has deep roots in the area with the region boasting the oldest course in continuous use in the nation: [[Foxburg Country Club]] dating from 1887. The [[Oakmont Country Club]] in suburban [[Oakmont, Pennsylvania|Oakmont]] and [[Plum, Pennsylvania|Plum Boroughs]] has hosted the [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]] championships (eight) more than any other course in the nation, as well as two [[U.S. Women's Open]] championships, three [[PGA Championship]]s, and eight [[U.S. Amateur]]s.

Prior to the Civil War, Pittsburgh was largely in opposition to slavery. This sentiment culminated in Pittsburgh being selected as the [[History of the United States Republican Party|birthplace of the national Republican Party]], when the party held its first convention in February 1856. From the [[American Civil War]] to the 1930s, Pittsburgh was a [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] stronghold. However, national economic turmoil combined with entrenched local GOP scandals by the 1930s brought to an end Republican rule. In [[Pittsburgh mayoral election, 1933|1933]], [[William N. McNair]] became the first Democrat to be elected mayor. With the exception of the [[Pittsburgh mayoral election, 1973|1973]] and [[Pittsburgh mayoral election, 1977|1977]] elections (where lifelong Democrats ran off the party ticket), Democratic candidates have been elected consecutively to the mayor's office since the Great Depression. Today, the ratio of Democratic to Republican registrations within the city is 5 to 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmfus.org/template/page.cfm?page_id=481|title= Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania – Transatlantic Cities Network|publisher=The German Marshall Fund of the United States|accessdate=May 6, 2009}} {{dead link|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Federally, Pittsburgh is part of [[Pennsylvania's 14th congressional district]], represented by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Michael F. Doyle|Mike Doyle]], elected in 1994. The [[Pittsburgh Police|Pittsburgh Police Bureau]] is the law enforcement arm of the city and the [[Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire]] is a major emergency response unit in Western Pennsylvania. Pittsburgh EMS provides emergency medical, heavy rescue, and river rescue services to the city.

By April 2008, the city and [[Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Allegheny County]] were discussing a plan to merge as early as 2009 in the interests of consolidating government and enhancing the status of the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kdka.com/politics/Pittsburgh.Allegheny.County.2.692217.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080408151806/http://kdka.com/politics/Pittsburgh.Allegheny.County.2.692217.html|archivedate=April 8, 2008 |title=kdka.com – Local Officials Look For Ways To Improve City-County Merger Recommendation |publisher=Kdka.com |date=April 4, 2008 |accessdate=January 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; If approved, the city of Pittsburgh would annex all of surrounding Allegheny County in a Metropolitan Government, and the population would stand at 1.2 million, making Pittsburgh the 10th largest city in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wtae.com/news/15782593/detail.html |title=Pittsburgh-Allegheny County Merger Recommended |publisher=ThePittsburghChannel.com |date=April 3, 2008 |accessdate=July 6, 2009}}{{dead link|date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, opposition to this plan is concerned about the added bureaucracy of big government, inefficiencies, and the possibility that corruption will extend to the newly annexed communities resulting in a loss of services and an increase in taxes due to higher debt service costs of the city.

{{Main|Transportation in Pittsburgh}}

Pittsburgh is a [[Bridges of Pittsburgh|city of bridges]] with a total of 446—a world record for a city.&lt;ref name=&quot;venice&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://kdka.com/local/bridge.Pittsburgh.2.383456.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20091121222948/http://kdka.com/local/bridge.Pittsburgh.2.383456.html|archivedate=2009-11-21|title=Pittsburgh has Plenty of Bridges|work=[[KDKA-TV]]|date=June 16, 2006|accessdate=July 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pittsburgh has three bridges more than [[Venice]], Italy, which has historically held the title &quot;City of Bridges.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20110707075415/http://www.abridgetovenezia.com/ponts.php?langue=en Bridges of Venice]. abridgetovenezia.com&lt;/ref&gt; Around 40 bridges cross the three rivers near the city.  The [[Smithfield Street Bridge]] was the world's first lenticular truss bridge. The city's  [[Three Sisters Bridges]] offer a picturesque view of the city from the North. The south-western &quot;entrance&quot; to Downtown for travelers coming in from  [[Interstate 79]] and the [[Pittsburgh International Airport]] is through the [[Fort Pitt Tunnel]] and over the [[Fort Pitt Bridge]]. The [[Fort Duquesne Bridge]] carrying [[Interstate 279]] is the main gateway from Downtown to both [[PNC Park]], [[Heinz Field]] and the [[Rivers Casino (Pittsburgh)|Rivers Casino]]. The  [[Panhandle Bridge]] carries the Port Authority's Blue/Red/Brown subway lines across the [[Monongahela River]].  The renovated [[Jones and Laughlin Steel Company|J&amp;L Steel Company]] bridge has been a key traffic/running-biking trail conduit connecting the [[Southside Works]] and [[Pittsburgh Technology Center]].

===Rail===
Along a major rail hub link between the east coast cities and American mid-west, Pittsburgh is home to one of [[Norfolk Southern Railway]]'s busiest freight corridors. The  [[Pittsburgh Line]] between the city and Harrisburg operates up to 70 runs per day. The suburban  [[Conway Yard|Conway Rail Yard]]—originally built in 1889—was the largest freight rail center in the world from 1956 until 1980 and remains the nation's second largest.  [[CSX]] freight also serves the city.

[[Amtrak]] intercity rail service via the ''[[Capitol Limited (Amtrak train)|Capitol Limited]]'' and the ''[[Pennsylvanian (Amtrak)|Pennsylvanian]]'' serves the city from [[Union Station (Pittsburgh)|Pennsylvania Station]], also known as Union Station.  Enhancements to allow for highspeed rail transit connections to Philadelphia and the [[Northeast Corridor]] are underway as part of the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]].

===Port===
Pittsburgh ranks as the 21st [[List of ports in the United States|largest port]] in the United States with almost 34 million short tons of river cargo for 2011, the port ranked 9th largest in the U.S. when measured in domestic trade.&lt;ref&gt;http://aapa.files.cms-plus.com/PDFs/2011%20U%20S%20%20PORT%20RANKINGS%20BY%20CARGO%20TONNAGE.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Locals refer to the interstates fanning out from [[downtown Pittsburgh]] as the &quot;parkways.&quot; [[Interstate 376|I-376]] is both the &quot;parkway east&quot; connecting to [[Interstate 76 (east)|I-76]] ([[Pennsylvania Turnpike]]) and the &quot;parkway west&quot; connecting to [[Interstate 79|I-79]], the [[Pittsburgh International Airport]], the Ohio end of the Turnpike and [[Interstate 80|I-80]]. The &quot;parkway north&quot; is [[Interstate 279|I-279]] connecting to I-79. The &quot;crosstown&quot; is [[Interstate 579|I-579]] allowing access to the heart of downtown, the [[Liberty Tunnels]] and the [[CONSOL Energy Center]]. Expressways such as [[Pennsylvania Route 28|Route 28]] and [[U.S. Route 22 (Pennsylvania)|Route 22]] also carry traffic from downtown to the northeast and western suburbs, respectively. [[Interstate 70|I-70]], I-79 and I-76 (the Turnpike) roughly form a triangular-shaped &quot;beltway&quot; with I-80 and [[Interstate 68|I-68]] within the city's media market's northern and southern boundaries. Several suburban Turnpike spurs along the [[Monongahela River]], the [[Pennsylvania Route 576|Airport]] and near [[Pennsylvania Route 66#Amos K. Hutchinson Bypass|Greensburg]] also help traffic flow. Navigation around the city and its suburbs can also be accomplished via the non-expressway [[Pittsburgh/Allegheny County Belt System]].

A planned highway system called the Mon-Fayette/Southern Beltway project would allow access from the south and southwest of the city via a limited-access tolled expressway system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paturnpike.com/MonFaySB/ |title=PA Turnpike Construction – Mon/Fayette &amp; Southern Beltway Projects |publisher=Paturnpike.com |date=November 14, 2008 |accessdate=January 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The projects are in the planning stages with some sections already open to traffic. The projects are being planned by The Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paturnpike.com|title=The Pennsylvania Turnpike|publisher=Paturnpike.com|accessdate=January 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Airports===
[[File:KPIT Land Terminal Night.jpg|thumb|Landside Terminal at Pittsburgh International Airport.]]
The city is served by [[Pittsburgh International Airport]] {{Airport codes|PIT}} {{convert|17|mi}} to the west in [[Findlay Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Findlay Township]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visitpittsburgh.com/ Pittsburgh Pennsylvania Convention and Visitors Bureau]. visitpittsburgh.com&lt;/ref&gt; The airport was the longtime major hub for [[US Airways]] from the company's start in the 1940s until the mid-2000s. In 2000, US Airways and its regional affiliates operated over 500 daily departures from Pittsburgh to more than 110 destinations; by 2007 fewer than 70 departures to 21 destinations remained.&lt;ref&gt;David Grossman, &quot;Dismantling Pittsburgh: Death of an airline hub,&quot; ''USA Today'' October 15, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2007, US Airways chose the city to house its new $25 million, 27,000 sq ft (2,500 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), 600-employees-strong [[US Airways#Flight Operations Center|Global Flight Operations Center]], consolidating its two smaller (pre-merger) centers in Phoenix, Arizona and along [[I-376]] in metro Pittsburgh. Currently, the largest promotions at the airport is the expansion of other airlines, particularly [[Delta Air Lines]]' new direct trans-Atlantic service to Paris as well as [[JetBlue]] and [[Southwest Airlines]] rapid expansion at the complex.

[[Arnold Palmer Regional Airport]] also offers commercial service east of the city in suburban [[Latrobe, Pennsylvania|Latrobe]] via [[Spirit Airlines]] to the Carolinas, Florida and Texas. Palmer has previously been served commercially by both US Airways and Delta since the 1980s.

[[Allegheny County Airport]] is the area's largest general aviation airport with 139,000 general aviation flights a year south of the city in [[West Mifflin, Pennsylvania|West Mifflin]]. The historic landmark art deco terminal was the main commercial airport for the metropolitan area until 1952.  When it opened in 1931 it was the nation's 3rd largest airport and the first in the U.S. with &quot;hard surface&quot; runways.

Smaller suburban and exurban airports (those in the Combined Statistical Area) that serve as private plane and corporate jet bases include: [[Butler County Airport|Butler Airport]], [[Zelienople Municipal Airport|Zelienople Airport]], [[Rock Airport]], [[New Castle Municipal Airport|New Castle Airport]] and [[Lakehill Airport]] to the north.
[[Rostraver Airport]], [[Joseph A. Hardy Connellsville Airport|Joseph Hardy Airport]] and [[Washington County Airport (Pennsylvania)|Washington County Airport]] to the south.
[[Pittsburgh-Monroeville Airport]], [[Greensburg Jeannette Regional Airport|Greensburg Jeannette Airport]] and [[Indiana County-Jimmy Stewart Airport|Jimmy Stewart Airport]] to the east.

===Public transit===
[[Port Authority of Allegheny County]], commonly known as the Port Authority, but sometimes referred to by its former nickname &quot;PAT&quot; or &quot;PAT Transit&quot;, is the region's mass transit system. While serving only a portion of the Pittsburgh area (the nation's 20th largest metro area), it is the 11th largest transit agency in the nation. Port Authority runs a network of intracity and intercity bus routes, the [[Monongahela Incline]] funicular railway (more commonly known as an &quot;incline&quot;) on Mount Washington, a [[Pittsburgh Light Rail|light rail]] system that runs mostly above-ground in the suburbs and underground as a subway in the city, and one of the nation's largest [[bus rapid transit|busway]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apta.com/research/stats/ridership/riderep/documents/07q1bus.pdf American Public Transportation Association – Largest Transit Agencies; July 6, 2007]{{dead link|date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Duquesne Incline]] is operated by a non-profit preservation trust,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.duquesneincline.org/ |title=Duquesne Incline, historic cable car railway serving commuters and tourists since 1877, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania |publisher=Incline.pghfree.net |date=October 14, 2008 |accessdate=January 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it does accept Port Authority passes and charge standard Port Authority tolls.

==History==
{{Main|History of Williamsport, Pennsylvania}}
Williamsport was incorporated as a [[borough (Pennsylvania)|borough]] on March 1, 1806, and as a city on January 15, 1866. The city is the original home of [[Little League Baseball]], founded in 1939 as a three-team league. The Little League World Series complex is currently based in South Williamsport and the Series itself is held in August.

In the late 19th century Williamsport was known as &quot;The Lumber Capital of the World&quot; because of its thriving [[lumber]] industry. It also was the birthplace of the national newspaper ''[[Grit (newspaper)|Grit]]'' in 1882. Williamsport once had more [[millionaires]] per-capita than anywhere else in the world. For this reason, the area's local high school, the [[Williamsport Area School District|Williamsport Area High School]], uses &quot;Millionaires&quot; as its team nickname.

The [[Peter Herdic House]], [[Hart Building (Williamsport, Pennsylvania)|Hart Building]], [[Millionaire's Row Historic District]], [[U.S. Post Office (Williamsport, Pennsylvania)|City Hall]], [[Williamsport Armory]], and [[Williamsport City Hall|Old City Hall]] are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nris&quot;&gt;{{NRISref|version=2010a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Clairton''' is a city in [[Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Allegheny County]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[United States]], along the [[Monongahela River]].  It is part of the [[Pittsburgh Metropolitan Area]]. The population was 6,796 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Census 2010&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://factfinder2.census.gov| title=Race, Hispanic or Latino, Age, and Housing Occupancy: 2010 Census Redistricting Data (Public Law 94-171) Summary File (QT-PL), Clairton city, Pennsylvania| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau, American FactFinder 2| accessdate=September 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Pennsylvania legal classifications for local governments, Clairton is considered a third-class city. It is home to [[U.S. Steel|Clairton Works]], the largest [[coke (fuel)|coke]] manufacturing facility in the United States.

The city was the setting for the movie ''[[The Deer Hunter]]'' (1978), although none of the movie was actually filmed there (other mill towns in the Monongahela River Valley and elsewhere in the tri-state area were used). Even the opening scene, which features a large sign saying &quot;Welcome to Clairton, City of Prayer,&quot; was shot in [[Mingo Junction, Ohio]], although its verbiage is based on smaller signs posted at the city's boundaries during the mid-1960s (as a response to the Supreme Court's 1963 ban on sponsored school prayer). 

The [[Montour Trail]], a recreational [[rail-trail]], extends from Clairton to [[Coraopolis, Pennsylvania]].

==Geography==
Clairton is located at {{coord|40|17|47|N|79|53|14|W|type:city}} (40.296419, -79.887090).{{GR|1}}

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|3.0|sqmi}}. {{convert|2.8|sqmi}} of it is land, and {{convert|0.2|sqmi}} of it (8.31%) is water.

==Surrounding neighborhoods==
The city is bordered by the boroughs of [[Elizabeth, Pennsylvania|Elizabeth]] (via Malady Bridge), [[Glassport, Pennsylvania|Glassport]] (via the [[Clairton-Glassport Bridge]]), [[Jefferson Hills, Pennsylvania|Jefferson Hills]], [[West Elizabeth, Pennsylvania|West Elizabeth]], and [[West Mifflin, Pennsylvania|West Mifflin]].

==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2009}}

Clairton’s existence began just after the turn of the 20th century when the [[Crucible Steel Company]] acquired a large tract along the west side of the [[Monongahela River]], about {{convert|13|mi}} south of [[Pittsburgh]]. Soon after, the Carnegie Steel Co. (later U.S. Steel) built an integrated [[steel mill]] and [[coke (fuel)|coke]] production facility, which eventually became one of the world's largest.

The site had more than {{convert|1000|acre|sqkm}} of level land suitable for a large industrial complex. On April 12, 1903, Clairton was incorporated as a borough, and on January 1, 1922, Clairton was incorporated as a City of the Third Class with a population of approximately 11,000. This incorporation was prompted by industry, which was taxed by the three boroughs - Clairton, Wilson and North Clairton - which were chartered separately prior to the incorporation of the City of Clairton. 

During the next several decades, growth and advancement indicated a thriving city. As the steel mill and coke production facilities expanded, the population of Clairton grew. Clairton took on a life of its own, including a business district and educational, religious, and cultural facilities. The city peaked in the late 1950s, and has been in decline since.&lt;ref name=&quot;Census1960&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Census1990&quot; /&gt;{{GR|2}}&lt;ref name=&quot;CensusPopEst&quot; /&gt;

In the late 1950s, Clairton High School (CHS) had a large student body, and the city had a &quot;feeder&quot; system of public and parochial elementary schools. The CHS student body was soon siphoned off, however, by new schools in Elizabeth Borough, Snowden Township, and Jefferson Borough. During the mid-1950s and into the 1960s, CHS was a Class AAA competitor in the formidable [[Western Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic League]] (WPIAL), playing against high schools in other mill towns up and down the Monongahela River Valley.

With the decline of the [[steel industry]] in the 1980s, Clairton began to experience severe problems in its employment and tax base, which spurred a major economic shock to the community. In 1988, Clairton was designated a distressed municipality by Pennsylvania's Department of Community Affairs (DCA). Pursuant to Act 47 of 1987 (the [[Financially Distressed Municipalities Act]]), DCA commissioned the development of a recovery plan for Clairton. By 1988, the [http://www.clairton.k12.pa.us/ Clairton School District] had consolidated its entire system into a single building (a remodeled version of the high school) and closed its other schools. Clairton High now competes at the Class A level in the WPIAL.  The high school football team has had national prominence for recent success.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/22/sports/in-clairton-pa-a-high-school-football-team-keeps-a-towns-heart-beating.html?hp&lt;/ref&gt;

As of the [[census]]{{GR|2}} of 2000, there were 8,491 people, 3,710 households, and 2,203 families residing in the city. The [[population density]] was 3,072.3 people per square mile (1,187.8/km²). There were 4,350 housing units at an average density of 1,573.9 per square mile (608.5/km²). The racial makeup of the city was 69.12% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 28.32% [[African American (U.S. Census)|African American]], 0.11% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 0.16% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], 0.28% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]], and 2.00% from two or more races. [[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]] of any race were 0.73% of the population. 17.5% were of [[italian people|Italian]], 9.8% [[german people|German]], 9.8% [[irish people|Irish]], 6.7% [[slovak people|Slovak]] and 5.0% [[english people|English]] ancestry according to [[Census 2000]]. 96.4% spoke [[english language|English]], 1.3% [[italian language|Italian]] and 1.1% [[french language|French]] as their first language.   

There were 3,710 households out of which 23.6% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 34.3% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 19.8% had a female householder with no husband present, and 40.6% were non-families. Of these households, 36.4% consisted of individuals and 18.5% had someone living alone who was 65 or older. The average household had 2.25 people and the average family size was 2.92.

The population was spread out with 22.1% under the age of 18, 7.2% from 18 to 24, 25.0% from 25 to 44, 21.6% from 45 to 64, and 24.0% who were 65 or older. The median age was 42. For every 100 females, there were 83.7 males. For every 100 females 18 and over, there were 78.3 males.

The median income for a household in the city was $25,596, and the median income for a family was $31,539. Males had a median income of $29,399 versus $21,743 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the city was $14,608. About 15.4% of families and 19.5% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 32.9% of those under age 18 and 14.0% of those age 65 or over.

==Economic development==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2009}}

The downtown area is the remnant of a once thriving shopping district, while the residential areas are the remains of housing built for Clairton Works employees. The collapse of the [[steel industry]] left a large portion of the population jobless, and large parts of the city have descended into [[poverty]] and crime. The city lacks the funding to carry out the demolition of condemned buildings, so empty storefronts and abandoned houses plague the area. Local groups have tried to encourage recovery, but have been unsuccessful due to lack of funding or interest. One of these groups, the [[Community Economic Development Corporation of Clairton]] (CEDCC), in conjunction with Allegheny County, the [[Allegheny County Housing Authority]], and state government, recently finished construction of a single-family housing development to encourage people to own rather than rent.

As another move toward recovery, Clairton recently introduced [[Land Value Taxation]] (LVT), which is based on the economic philosophies of [[Henry George]], [[Thomas Paine]], [[Adam Smith]] and others. This move has reduced taxation for almost all homeowners. The revenue garnered from land is now 81.2% as opposed to 26.5% without LVT (most of the burden of the property tax has shifted away from what people build or buy).
