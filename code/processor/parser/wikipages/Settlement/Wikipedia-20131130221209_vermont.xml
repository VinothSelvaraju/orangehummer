'''Winooski''' {{IPAc-en|w|ɪ|ˈ|n|uː|s|k|i}} is a city in [[Chittenden County, Vermont|Chittenden County]], [[Vermont]], in the [[United States]]. Located at the mouth of the [[Winooski River]], as of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]] the city population was 7,267.&lt;ref&gt;[http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=DEC_10_PL_GCTPL1.ST16&amp;prodType=table] City Data&lt;/ref&gt; It is part of the [[Burlington-South Burlington, VT Metropolitan Statistical Area]].

==Geography==
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 1.5&amp;nbsp;square miles (3.9&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), of which 1.4&amp;nbsp;square miles (3.7&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) is land and 0.1&amp;nbsp;square mile (0.2&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) (5.30%) is water.

===Etymology===
The word &quot;winooski&quot; comes from the language of the [[Abenaki]] tribe, and means &quot;this is where the wild onions grow&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

==History==
&lt;!---unless this pic was taken in Winooski, it doesn't belong in this article
[[File:Child workers in Winooski.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[child labor|Child workers]] at American Woolen Mills, September 1910. Photographed by [[Lewis Hine]].]]---&gt;

===Pre-columbian===
5000 years ago a single family of [[paleolithic]] native Americans came to what is now the city.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} The prehistoric campground for this transient group is one of Vermont's significant archaeological sites. Other native people came to Winooski in the years that followed.&lt;ref name=&quot;onionc&quot;&gt;[http://www.onioncity.com/htm/historical_look.htm Historical Look at Winooski]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colonial===
Situated on a main travel route, Winooski most likely started out as a trading city.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} With a set of [[waterfalls]] to assist the growth of industry, it soon became a center for [[wool]] processing.&lt;ref name=&quot;onionc&quot;/&gt;

In the early 1770s [[Ira Allen]] constructed a blockhouse on the Winooski (then &quot;Onion&quot;) River which served both as a fort and as general store and office for the land-speculating &quot;Onion River Company.&quot; &quot;Fort Frederick&quot; was never used for defense, but its presence increased the value of Onion River property and promoted settlement.&lt;ref name=&quot;onionc&quot;/&gt;

===Post-colonial===
{{further|Winooski Falls Mill District}}
After the Revolutionary War, Ira Allen built a dam across the river with a sawmill at each end.&lt;ref name=&quot;onionc&quot;/&gt;

In the late 1830s the Burlington Mill Company used the river's power for the manufacture of yarns and cloth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.burlingtonvermonthomes.com/towns/winooski.htm About Winooski]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!---could use a more scholarly reference here---&gt;

In 1846, James and Lucinda Stone from Winooski settled in [[Sheboygan County, Wisconsin|Sheboygan County]] in the [[Wisconsin Territory]] and named their new settlement [[Winooski, Wisconsin]].

===Modern times===
The [[American Woolen Company]] purchased the failing [[Burlington Mills]] in 1901 restoring a measure of economic growth to the area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.burlingtonvt.org/arts-and-humanities/search.cgi?query=woolen Burlington Vt. area]&lt;/ref&gt; This success eventually led Winooski to incorporate as a city in 1922, breaking away from the town of [[Colchester, Vermont|Colchester]].

The mills closed in 1954, resulting in two decades of economic problems for the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;Historical look at Winooski&quot;&gt;[http://www.onioncity.com/htm/historical_look.htm Historical look at Winooski]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, two old mills were converted into commercial, office, and apartment space, helping to revitalize the area.&lt;ref name=&quot;Historical look at Winooski&quot;/&gt;

In 1979, the city researched the construction of a dome over the entire city of Winooski, to reduce heating costs during the winter. The proposed dome would have been {{convert|200|ft}} at the center, and internal combustion engines would have been banned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,912572,00.html A Dome for Winooski? - TIME Magazine] retrieved June 15, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Though the dome was never built, to this day the city's planner defends the concept, insisting &quot;Economically, it's a slam dunk,&quot; and adding &quot;You could have had year-round fly-fishing.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://hplusmagazine.com/articles/politics/doomed-dome-future-never-was Doomed Dome: The Future That Never Was] retrieved November 8, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Portal|Franco-Americans}}
In 2008, the city dismissed their city manager of 11 months, while he was still an &quot;at-will&quot; employee. His contract had been scheduled for three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Sutkoski, Matt |title = Winooski manager's future cloudy | publisher = Burlington Free Press | date = September 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

is a city in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Vermont]] that serves as the state [[Capital (political)|capital]] and the shire town&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leg.state.vt.us/statutes/fullsection.cfm?Title=24&amp;Chapter=001&amp;Section=00013 Title 24, Part I, Chapter 1, §13], Vermont Statutes. Accessed 2007-11-01.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[county seat]]){{GR|6}} of [[Washington County, Vermont|Washington County]]. As the capital of Vermont, Montpelier is the site of the [[Vermont State House]], seat of the legislative branch of Vermont government. The population was 7,855 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. By population, it is the smallest state capital in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.everyday-democracy.org/en/Article.495.aspx Smallest capital city plans big MLK celebration].

==History==
[[Image:Bird's-eye View of Montpelier, VT.jpg|thumb|left|Bird's-eye view, c. 1912]]
The first permanent settlement began in May 1787, when Colonel Jacob Davis and General Parley Davis arrived from [[Charlton, Massachusetts]]. General Davis surveyed the land, while Colonel Davis cleared forest and erected a large log house on the west side of the North Branch of the [[Winooski River]]. His family moved in the following winter.

It was Colonel Davis who selected the name Montpelier after the French city [[Montpellier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Federal Writers' Project]] of the [[Works Progress Administration]] for the State of Vermont |title=Vermont: A guide to the Green Mountain State |year=1996 |publisher=The Stephen Greene Press |pages=117 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a general enthusiasm for things French as a result of the country's aid during the [[American Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Swift, Esther Munroe |title=Vermont Place Names: Footprints of History |year=1977 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |pages=451–454 |isbn=0-8289-0291-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The settlement grew quickly, and by 1791 the population reached 117.

In 1825, the [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette|Marquis de Lafayette]] visited Montpelier on a triumphal tour of America, 50 years after the Revolutionary War.

The town developed into a center for manufacturing, especially after the [[Vermont Central Railroad]] opened in Montpelier on June 20, 1849—the same year [[East Montpelier, Vermont|East Montpelier]] was set off as a separate town. [[waterfall|Falls]] on the Winooski River provided [[water power]] for [[water mill|mills]]. There was an [[iron]] [[foundry]].

Today, government, higher education, insurance  and tourism are principal businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Montpelier: Economy-Major Industries|url=http://www.city-data.com/us-cities/The-Northeast/Montpelier-Economy.html|work=City.com|accessdate=1 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Vermont History Museum, operated in [[The Pavilion (Vermont)|The Pavilion]] by the [[Vermont Historical Society]], is an attraction.

The town had the first municipal water driven hydro system in Vermont in 1884. Water pressure generated sufficient electricity for streetlights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Lori | last=Barg | title=Power from the plumbing | url=| work= | publisher=Burlington Free Press | location=Burlington, Vermont | pages= 5D | date=9 August 2009 | id= | accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state proclaimed October 12, 1899, as &quot;Dewey Day&quot; to honor native son [[George Dewey]], the hero of [[Battle of Manila Bay]] and the [[Spanish-American War]]. Thousands turned out from the state to his hometown of Montpelier for the celebration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vermonthistory.org/documents/findaid/dewey.pdf |title=George Dewey (1837-1917) Family Papers, 1844-1901 MS 125 |accessdate=April 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!---doubtless the ONLY day the state has ever celebrated a living person---&gt;&lt;!--plenty of footnotes available BTW if you don't like this one---&gt;

==Geography==
[[Image:Winooski river montpelier.jpg|left|thumb|[[Winooski River]] at Montpelier]]
Montpelier is located at {{Coord|44|15|N|72|34|W|type:city}} (44.2500, -72.5667) in the north-central area of Vermont.{{GR|1}} The city center is a flat clay zone (elevation ~520&amp;nbsp;ft/158&amp;nbsp;m), surrounded by hills and granite ledges. Towne Hill runs in a {{convert|2|mi|km|adj=on}} ridge (~900&amp;nbsp;ft/275&amp;nbsp;m) along the northern edge of the city. Montpelier is situated among [[foothill]]s just to the east of the [[Green Mountains (Vermont)|Green Mountains]].

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|10.3|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|10.2|sqmi|km2}} is land and 0.10% is water. The [[Winooski River]] flows west along the south edge of downtown village and is fed by several smaller tributaries that cut through residential districts. Montpelier is subject to periodic flooding in the flat city center, with two major floods occurring in 1927 and 1992.

On its borders are the towns of [[Middlesex, Vermont|Middlesex]] to the west, [[Berlin, Vermont|Berlin]] to the south, and [[East Montpelier, Vermont|East Montpelier]] to the north and east. Montpelier lies nearly in the geographic center of the state.

Montpelier features a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Dfb''), with long, cold, and snowy winters, short springs and autumns, and warm summers. From January to July, daily means range from {{convert|16.4|to|67.3|F|C|1}}. In winter, lows fall below {{convert|0|F|0}} on 24 nights and daytime highs stay below freezing for the majority of days from December to February. Snow is also frequent and remains on the ground for long stretches throughout the winter, though thaws are by no means infrequent. Average annual snowfall is {{convert|94.2|in}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.erh.noaa.gov/btv/climo/stations/montpelier.shtml NWS Burlington Forecast Office]&lt;/ref&gt; Summers are warm and often humid, with 2 or 3 days above {{convert|90|F|0}}, but rarely reaching {{convert|95|F}}.

'''Burlington''' is the largest city in the [[U.S. state|State]] of [[Vermont]] and the shire town ([[county seat]]){{GR|6}} of [[Chittenden County, Vermont|Chittenden County]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leg.state.vt.us/statutes/fullsection.cfm?Title=24&amp;Chapter=001&amp;Section=00005 Title 24, Part I, Chapter 1, §5], Vermont Statutes. Accessed 2007-11-01.&lt;/ref&gt; It lies {{convert|45|mi}} south of the U.S.-[[Canadian]] (Vermont-[[Quebec]]) border and {{convert|94|mi}} south of [[Montreal]].

Burlington had a population of 42,417 at the 2010 census. The city is the hub of the [[Burlington-South Burlington metropolitan area]], consisting of the three northwestern Vermont counties of Chittenden, [[Franklin County, Vermont|Franklin]] and [[Grand Isle County, Vermont|Grand Isle]] and encompassing the cities of Burlington, [[South Burlington, Vermont|South Burlington]], and [[Winooski, Vermont|Winooski]]; the towns of [[Colchester, Vermont|Colchester]], [[Essex, Vermont|Essex]], and [[Williston, Vermont|Williston]]; and the village of [[Essex Junction, Vermont|Essex Junction]]. According to the 2012 U.S. Census estimates, the metro area had an estimated population of 213,701, approximately one third of Vermont's total population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/popest/data/metro/totals/2012/tables/CBSA-EST2012-01.csv|title=Table 1.

==Etymology==
Two theories have been put forward for the origin of Burlington's name.  The first is that it was named after [[Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington|Richard Boyle]], [[Earl of Burlington|3rd Earl of Burlington]], while the second is that the name honors the politically prominent and wealthy Burling family of New York. While no family members are listed as grantees of the town, the family held large tracts of land in other nearby towns, some of which were granted on the same day as Burlington.&lt;ref&gt;Swift, Esther Munroe (1977) ''Vermont Place-Names'' ISBN 0-8289-0291-7. p.165&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the [[New Hampshire grants]], the land which became Burlington was awarded by Governor [[Benning Wentworth]] on June 7, 1763 to Samuel Willis and 63 others.&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;&gt;Coolidge, A. J. and Mansfield, J. B. [http://books.google.com/books?id=OcoMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=coolidge+mansfield+history+description+new+england+1859&amp;source=web&amp;ots=cUndZkVSIF&amp;sig=tIIdKdnVIkM1ULWZYVqH4J03FbE&amp;hl=en#PPA765,M1  ''A History and Description of New England'']. Boston, 1859&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 1775 land clearing began and two or three log huts were erected, but the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolution]] delayed permanent settlement until 1783, when Stephen Lawrence arrived with his family. The town was organized in 1785.&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;/&gt;

The [[War of 1812]] was unpopular in Vermont. Along with the rest of [[New England]], Vermont did not provide militia units or financial support. Vermont voted for the [[Federalist party]], which opposed the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;&gt;Johnson, Tim. &quot;1812: A look back at Burlington's 20-minute war&quot;. ''[[Burlington Free Press]]'' (July 29, 2007) p.4A&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, 5,000 troops were stationed there at one point during the War of 1812, outnumbering residents; about 500 of them died of disease.&lt;ref&gt;Logan, Lee. &quot;Grant may help Burlington reclaim War of 1812 heritage&quot; ''[[Burlington Free Press]]'' (July 8, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Some soldiers were quartered in the main building at the [[University of Vermont]], where a memorial plaque commemorates them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrmm.org/quad/1909champlain/contents.html ]{{dead link|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a skirmish on August 2, 1813, the British shelled Burlington. This has either been cited as a bold stroke by the British with an ineffectual response from the Americans, or a weak sally by the British, properly ignored by the Americans, depending on who relates the story. The cannonade lasted for about ten minutes and did not affect the outcome of the war. The American side was commanded by Naval Lieutenant [[Thomas Macdonough]], later hero of the [[Battle of Plattsburgh|Battle of Lake Champlain]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;/&gt;

The town's position on Lake Champlain helped it develop into a [[port of entry]] and center for trade, particularly after completion of the [[Champlain Canal]] in 1823, the [[Erie Canal]] in 1825, and the [[Chambly Canal]] in 1843. Wharves allowed [[steamboat]]s to connect [[freight]] and passengers with the [[Rutland and Burlington Railroad|Rutland &amp; Burlington Railroad]] and [[Vermont Central Railroad]]. Burlington became a bustling [[lumbering]] and [[manufacturing]] center, and incorporated as a city in 1865. Its [[Victorian era]] prosperity left behind much fine [[architecture]], including buildings by [[Ammi B. Young]], [[H. H. Richardson]] and [[McKim, Mead &amp; White]].

In 1870, the waterfront was extended by construction of the Pine Street Barge Canal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lcbp.org/Wayside/PDFS/Pine_Street/Pine_Street.pdf Pine Street Barge Canal]&lt;/ref&gt; This became polluted over the years and is a focus for cleanup in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/superfund/community/cag/resource/r1/pineeval.pdf Evaluation of Pine Street Canal]&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear left}}

===Recent events===
The ice cream enterprise [[Ben &amp; Jerry's]] was founded in Burlington in 1978 in a renovated gas station.

In 2007, the city was named one of the top four &quot;places to watch&quot; in the United States by the [[American Association of Retired Persons]] (AARP).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rismedia.com/wp/2007-07-23/aarp-the-magazine-announces-top-five-places-to-live-and-retire retrieved on July 24, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; The ratings were based on what was perceived as ideal for older residents. Criteria included the factors which make a community livable: new urbanism, [[smart growth]], mixed-use development, and easy-living standards.

[[Forbes]] magazine selected the city in 2010 as one of the &quot;prettiest&quot; towns in America, featuring a picture of the [[Church Street Marketplace (Burlington, Vermont)|Church Street Marketplace]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forbes.com/2010/04/15/americas-prettiest-towns-lifestyle-real-estate-top-spring_slide_3.html] retrieved September 6, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Burlington is situated on the eastern shore of [[Lake Champlain]], north of Shelburne Bay. It was built on a strip of land extending about {{convert|6|mi|km}} south from the mouth of the [[Winooski River]] along the lake shore, and rises from the water's edge to a height of {{convert|300|ft|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://maps.maptech.com Maptech MapServer II]{{dead link|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large ravine in what is now downtown was filled in with refuse and raw sewage in the 19th century to make way for further development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | first=Joel Banner | last=Baird | title=What lies beneath | url=| work= | newspaper=[[The Burlington Free Press]] | location=Burlington, Vermont | pages= 1C | date=August 3, 2013 | id= | accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===
Burlington has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Dfb''), with cold winters and very warm, humid summers. The monthly daily average temperatures ranges from {{convert|18.7|°F|1}} in January to {{convert|70.6|°F|1}} in July. The annual precipitation of {{convert|36.8|in|mm|0}} is well-distributed throughout the year, but the summer months are the wettest. The city's location east of Lake Champlain sometimes accounts for localized [[snow squall]]s, producing up to {{convert|13|in|cm|0}} in 12 hours on rare occasions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apollo.lsc.vsc.edu/ams/AMS%20VP/Storm%20Conference/NESC%20Presentations/32ndNESC_Presentation/Abstracts/Payer.pdf ]{{dead link|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Annual snowfall averages {{convert|85|in|cm|0}}, but this figure can fluctuate greatly from one year to another. Extremes have ranged from {{convert|-30|F|abbr=on}} on January 15, 1957 and February 12, 1979 to {{convert|101|F|abbr=on}} on August 11, 1944.&lt;ref name= TWC &gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/USVT0033

==Transportation==

===Bus===
Burlington is the central focus of the [[Chittenden County Transportation Authority]] (CCTA), providing bus service to and from the surrounding communities (and the shopping districts of [[South Burlington, Vermont|South Burlington]] and [[Williston, Vermont|Williston]]).

On June 15, 2011, the CCTA announced that it had changed its charter, effective July 1, 2011, to allow municipalities outside Chittenden County to join CCTA as member communities, thereby allowing CCTA to become Vermont’s first regional transit authority. As part of its expansion, the CCTA will merge with the [[Green Mountain Transit Authority]] (GMTA), which provides bus service in the Barre/Montpelier area and surrounding communities in central Vermont.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title=CCTA Announces Regional Transition | url=http://www.cctaride.org/pdf/Documents/Transition.pdf | work= | publisher=CCTA | location=Burlington, Vermont | pages=  | date=15 June 2010 | id= | accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]] provides intercity bus service from the [[Burlington International Airport]] to other communities in Vermont as well as to [[Montreal]]'s [[Gare d'autocars de Montreal]], [[Boston]]'s [[South Station]] and [[Logan International Airport]], while [[Megabus (North America)|Megabus]] provides non-stop service between Burlington and [[Boston]] and service to [[New York City]] with intermediate stops in [[Saratoga Springs, New York]] or [[Amherst, Massachusetts]] and [[Hartford, Connecticut]].

[[File:Union Station Burlington Vermont central section.jpg|thumb|right|267px|Burlington's [[Union Station (Burlington, Vermont)|Union Station]] was built in 1916 by the [[Central Vermont Railway]] and the [[Rutland Railroad]].  It currently services only tourist rail service.]]

===Rail===
From the late nineteenth century to 1953 the [[Rutland Railroad]] provided passenger service on the ''Green Mountain Flyer'' and the ''Mount Royal'' from Burlington to [[Chatham, New York]], with connecting service to [[New York City]] via the [[New York Central Railroad]]. The last train north to [[Alburgh (town), Vermont|Alburgh]] in the extreme northwest of the state was in 1948. From 1916 this service was provided at the new Union Station on the Lake Champlain waterfront.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Rutland Railroad&quot; http://www.r2parks.net/RUT.html&lt;/ref&gt; From 2000 to 2003 the ''[[Champlain Flyer]]'' was a commuter service from Burlington south to [[Charlotte, Vermont|Charlotte]].

Currently, however, Burlington does not have any active railroad connections, although there is an [[Amtrak]] station {{convert|10|mi|0|abbr=out}} away in [[Essex Junction, Vermont|Essex Junction]].

In January, 2013 Vermont Governor [[Peter Shumlin]] proposed extending the Ethan Allen Express from Rutland to Burlington, the state's largest city. The proposal would create a [[regional rail|regional rail corridor]] connecting Albany, Saratoga Springs, Rutland and Burlington and their combined metro populations of around 1.25 million inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;Thursday, January 31, 2013, Vermont governor seeks more Amtrak service, Written by Douglas John Bowen, http://www.railwayage.com/index.php/passenger/intercity/vermont-governor-seeks-more-amtrak-service.html?channel=41&lt;/ref&gt;

===Air===
Air carriers at [[Burlington International Airport]] provide the area with commercial service to major regional hubs and international airports. While scheduled carriers have not traditionally offered scheduled commercial flights to destinations outside the United States, there is a Customs Port of Entry for unscheduled flights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/toolbox/contacts/ports/vt/0207.xml Port Of Entry&amp;nbsp;– Burlington International Airport]&lt;/ref&gt;  In December, 2011, Porter Airlines began offering seasonal scheduled service from [[Toronto, Ontario]], [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/porter-airlines-debuts-in-burlington-vermont-135688113.html |title=Porter Airlines debuts in Burlington, Vermont |publisher=Prnewswire.com |date=2011-12-15 |accessdate=2013-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Major roads===
Burlington is served by one major Interstate highway, along with its spur route into the southern part of the city, and is at the junction of two U.S. highways. Several Vermont state highways also provide routes into and through the Burlington area.

* [[File:I-89.svg|20px]] [[Interstate 89]] - Though it does not directly enter the Burlington city limits, I-89 has interchanges in neighboring South Burlington, Winooski, and Colchester that provide access to downtown.

* [[File:US 2.svg|20px]] [[U.S. Route 2]] is the main east-west route entering Burlington. After entering the city from the east, westbound U.S. 2 turns north to run concurrently with U.S. 7 towards Winooski and Colchester. The intersection with Interstate 89 is used by 42,000 cars daily.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | first=Joel Banner | last=Baird | title=Planners propose US 2 realignment | url=| work= | publisher=Burlington Free Press | location=Burlington, Vermont | pages= 2C | date=10 June 2010 | id= | accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[File:US 7.svg|20px]] [[U.S. Route 7]] is the main north-south route through Burlington. Northbound U.S. 7 joins westbound U.S. 2 in downtown Burlington, and the two routes run concurrently north to Colchester.

===Ferry service===
Burlington is the headquarters of the [[Lake Champlain Transportation Company]] with seasonal service provided between Burlington's King Street ferry terminal and [[Port Kent, New York]] to the west, across Lake Champlain.

{{anchor|Fletcher Free Library}}
===Public library===
[[File:Fletcher Free Library Burlngton Vermont.jpg|thumb|325px|The Carnegie Building of the Fletcher Free Library in 2013]]

The '''Fletcher Free Library''' at 253 College Street at the corner of S. Winooski Avenue was established in 1873, endowed by Mary Martha Fletcher, the daughter of a local businessman, but outgrew its initial building on Church Street by 1901. A new building was constructed in 1901-04 with funds provided by industrialist and philanthropist [[Andrew Carnegie]], making it the first of the four [[Carnegie library|Carnegie libraries]] in the state.   It was designed in the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] style by Walter R. B. Willcox of Burlington, who won a competition to receive the commission.&lt;ref name=ffldesrep /&gt;  

The building had major settling problems in 1973 where it had been built over a former railroad ravine, which had been improperly filled in, and the library's collection was moved elsewhere.  The possible razing of the building was stopped by a citizens' committee, which successfully had it added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]], and a grant allowed the stabilization and repair of the building.  A new modern addition was completed in 1981.&lt;ref name=ffldesrep&gt;[http://www.burlingtonvt.gov/PZ/Historic-Preservation/National-Register-PDFs/CarnegieBldgFletcherFreeLibrary/ &quot;Fletcher Free Library Designation Report&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fletcherfree.org/about.html &quot;About&quot;] on the library website&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest public library in Vermont, and listed on the [[List of Registered Historic Places in Chittenden County, Vermont|National Register of Historic Places]], the Fletcher Free Library had a budget of over $1 million in 2002.  It circulated more books, had more visitors, and had more computers,  than any other library in Vermont.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = |title = Libraries on the rise | publisher = Burlington Free Press | date = July 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to its primary services as Burlington's public library, it is also a community center, a cultural resource for newly arrived immigrants to the Burlington area, and the City's only free public access computer center.

===Infrastructure===
The city has [[municipal broadband|municipal fiber broadband]], which provides [[telephone]], [[broadband internet]], and [[television]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.burlingtontelecom.net/about_us/index.htm|title=About Burlington Telecom|publisher=[[Burlington Telecom]]|author=[[Burlington Telecom]]|accessdate=2009-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, cable management tried to drop [[Al-Jazeera English]] from the lineup. This was successfully thwarted by protesters and the station was, in 2009, one of three &quot;small cable operators&quot; in the nation to carry this channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/blog/secondopinion/2008/05/to-al-jazeera-or-to-not-al-jazeera.html |title=Staff Blogs &amp;#124; Burlington Free Press |publisher=burlingtonfreepress.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Surk, Barbara and Schreck, Adam. &quot;Al-Jazeera drew U.S. viewers to web for news&quot; ''[[Burlington Free Press]]'' (January 25, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Vermont Lake Monsters]] of the [[New York&amp;nbsp;– Penn League]], a Class A short-season (June to September) minor league baseball team, were formerly called the [[Vermont Expos]]. The team changed its name in 2007 after its parent Major League Baseball club, the [[Montreal Expos]]  of the [[National League]], moved from Montreal to Washington, D.C. and became the [[Washington Nationals]]. In 2010, the Lake Monsters ended its 17-year association with the Expos/Nationals and became the Class A affiliate of the [[Oakland Athletics]] of the [[American League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://web.minorleaguebaseball.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20100923&amp;content_id=15000546&amp;vkey=news_t462&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;sid=t462 | author = Vermont Lake Monsters |title = Vermont Joins Oakland A's Organization | publisher = Vermont Lake Monsters | date = September 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lake Monsters play on the campus of the [[University of Vermont]]  at Centennial Field.

Burlington has a rich hockey history, and was the location of the first known international [[ice hockey]] match, held between the [[Montreal Crystals]] and employees of the [[Urban A. Woodbury#Postwar life|Van Ness House]], a local hotel, during the [[Montreal Winter Carnival ice hockey tournaments#1886 Burlington Winter Carnival|1886 Burlington Winter Carnival]].

A professional basketball franchise, the [[Vermont Frost Heaves]], played half of their season in the city. The team, which originally was part of the [[American Basketball Association (2000–)|American Basketball Association]] &amp;ndash; not to be confused with the 1970s-era major basketball league of the same name that merged with the National Basketball Association &amp;ndash; moved to the [[Premier Basketball League]] in 2008 and split their regular-season home games between Burlington and [[Barre (city), Vermont|Barre]]. The Frost Heaves, owned by ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' writer [[Alexander Wolff]], played their Burlington games at the Memorial Auditorium, on South Union Street, at the corner of Main. However, the franchise folded in early 2011.

There is also a [[rugby union]] team, the Burlington RFC.

Daniel W. Fish, a former member of the Air Force's Wings of Blue, was the first person to obtain a permit to skydive in the city of Burlington.

Rutland is the third largest city in [[Vermont]]. It is surrounded by the town of [[Rutland (town), Vermont|Rutland]], which is a separate municipality. The [[Rutland Downtown Historic District|downtown area]] of the city is listed as a historic district on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

==History==
[[File:Merchants' Row, Looking North, Rutland, VT.jpg|thumb|left|Merchants' Row in 1907]]
It began on [[Otter Creek (Vermont)|Otter Creek]] in the early 19th century as a small hamlet called Mill Village in Rutland, the surrounding town named by Governor [[Benning Wentworth]] in 1761 after [[John Manners, 3rd Duke of Rutland]].&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=OcoMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=coolidge+mansfield+history+description+new+england+1859&amp;source=web&amp;ots=cUndZkVSIF&amp;sig=tIIdKdnVIkM1ULWZYVqH4J03FbE&amp;hl=en#PPA891,M1 A. J. Coolidge &amp; J. B. Mansfield, ''A History and Description of New England;'' Boston, Massachusetts 1859]&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 19th century, small high-quality [[marble]] deposits were discovered in Rutland, and in the 1830s a large deposit of nearly solid marble was found in what is now [[West Rutland, Vermont|West Rutland]]. By the 1840s, small firms had begun excavations, but marble [[quarry|quarries]] proved profitable only after the [[railroad]] arrived in 1851. At the same time, the famous quarries of [[Carrara]] in [[Tuscany]], [[Italy]], grew largely unworkable because of their extreme depth, allowing Rutland to become one of the world's leading marble producers.&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;/&gt;

This fueled enough growth and investment that in 1886 the center of town incorporated as Rutland village. Most of the town was split off as West Rutland and [[Proctor, Vermont|Proctor]], which contained the bulk of the marble quarries. Rutland City was incorporated as Vermont's third city on November 18, 1892. The new city's first mayor was [[John A. Mead]], who served only one term in 1893.&lt;ref&gt;109th Annual Report Fiscal Year July 1, 2000 to June 30, 2001 City of Rutland, Vermont&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1894, the nation's first [[polio]] outbreak was identified in the Rutland area. 132 people from the Rutland area were affected. Seven died. 110 others suffered some paralysis for life. 55 were from the city itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Remsen, Nancy |title = Polio marker moved to public spot | publisher = Burlington Free Press | date = September 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Berwick House, Rutland, VT.jpg|thumb|left|The Berwick House in 1907]]

In 1903, a Rutland City ordinance restricting the carrying of firearms led to the [[Vermont Supreme Court]]'s decision in ''State v. Rosenthal'', thereby establishing protection for the carrying of firearms without permit or license, what has become known as &quot;Vermont Carry&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.guncite.com/court/state/55a610.html&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Rutland had a similar ordinance in place as late as 1998,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vtlp.org/main/media/news/pr980622-RutlandGunRights.html&lt;/ref&gt; at which point it was challenged and eventually removed, and there have been reports from residents of police harassment over openly carrying firearms as recently as June 2008.&lt;ref&gt;http://opencarry.mywowbb.com/forum53/11480.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The closing of the marble quarries in the area in the 1980s and 1990s cost the area jobs.

==Geography==
Rutland is located at {{Coord|43|36|32|N|72|58|47|W|type:city}} (43.60889, -72.97972).{{GR|1}}

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|7.67|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|7.6|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|0.04|sqmi}}, or 0.52%, is water. Rutland is drained by [[Otter Creek (Vermont)|Otter Creek]], Moon Brook, Tenney Brook, East Creek and Mussey Brook.

==Transportation==
===Rail===
[[Rutland (Amtrak station)|Rutland's railroad station]] is the terminal station for [[Amtrak]]'s [[Ethan Allen Express]], which provides daily 5.5 hour service to and from [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;Ethan Allen Express, Amtrak Timetable, 2013, http://www.amtrak.com/ethan-allen-express-train&lt;/ref&gt; In January, 2013 Vermont Governor [[Peter Shumlin]] proposed extending the Ethan Allen Express from Rutland to [[Burlington, Vermont]], the state's largest city. The proposal would create a [[regional rail|regional rail corridor]] connecting Albany, Saratoga Springs, Rutland and Burlington and their combined metro populations of around 1.25 million inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;Thursday, January 31, 2013, Vermont governor seeks more Amtrak service, Written by Douglas John Bowen, http://www.railwayage.com/index.php/passenger/intercity/vermont-governor-seeks-more-amtrak-service.html?channel=41&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bus===
{{Main|Marble Valley Regional Transit District}}
Rutland is home to &quot;The Bus&quot;, run by [[Marble Valley Regional Transit District]], a local bus system costing $0.50 per person per ride ($0.25 for discount qualified riders), and $1-2 for out-of-town commuter and connector buses, with other expenses covered largely by taxpayers. Five local routes currently serve the city, along with other commuter routes serving the nearby towns of [[Fair Haven, Vermont|Fair Haven]], [[Manchester, Vermont|Manchester]], [[Middlebury, Vermont|Middlebury]] (via connection with ACTR bus in Brandon), and [[Proctor, Vermont|Proctor]]. 2 winter tourist geared buses also go to and from [[Okemo Mountain]] in [[Ludlow (town), Vermont|Ludlow]] and [[Killington Ski Resort]], with the latter being known as the Diamond Express. Both of these buses run year round. &quot;The Bus&quot; was free prior to 2007, when the 50 cents fare was added to control the added gas expenses.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} MVRTD is housed in the downtown Marble Valley Regional Transit Center.
[[File:The Bus Rutland.jpg|thumb|The Bus, downtown Rutland]]

===Air===
The [[Rutland Southern Vermont Regional Airport]] is located just south of the city, in [[Clarendon, Vermont|North Clarendon]]. The airport offers daily flights to Boston operated by [[Cape Air]].
===Car/Truck===
Rutland is the largest city in Vermont that is not located on, or near, either of the state's two major Interstate highways. [[U.S. Route 4]] and [[U.S. Route 7]] intersect in Rutland and are the two main routes into the city. U.S. 7 connects Rutland with [[Manchester, Vermont|Manchester]] and [[Bennington, Vermont|Bennington]] to the south, and with [[Middlebury, Vermont|Middlebury]] and [[Burlington, Vermont|Burlington]] to the north. To the east of Rutland, U.S. 4 travels through [[Killington, Vermont|Killington]] and [[Woodstock, Vermont|Woodstock]] on its way toward [[New Hampshire]]. To the west, U.S. 4 has been rebuilt as a 4-lane freeway to the [[New York]] state line, a distance of just over {{convert|18|mi|km}}. It is currently the only limited-access freeway to serve Rutland. The former route of U.S. 4, which runs parallel to the freeway portion, is now signed as [[Vermont Route 4A]].

'''Barre''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ær|i}} is a city in [[Washington County, Vermont|Washington County]], [[Vermont]], in the [[United States]]. As of the [[United States Census, 2010|2010 census]], the city population was 9,052.&lt;ref&gt;[http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?src=bkmk American Fact Finder. U.S. Census Bureau. Retrieved 3 February 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt; Barre City is almost completely surrounded by [[Barre (town), Vermont|Barre (town)]], [[Vermont]], which is incorporated separately from the City of Barre.

Barre is often twinned with nearby [[Montpelier, Vermont|Montpelier]] in local media and businesses. It is the main city in the Barre Micropolitan area which, at 59,564 residents, is the 3rd largest in Vermont (after [[Burlington, Vermont|Burlington]] and [[Rutland (city), Vermont|Rutland]]). Barre itself is the largest city in [[Washington County, Vermont|Washington County]], and is the 4th largest city and the 10th largest municipality in Vermont.

[[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s movie ''[[The Trouble With Harry]]'' was premiered at the Paramount Theater in Barre on September 27, 1955.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0048750/ Internet Movie Database entry, The Trouble with Harry], accessed May 14, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/1902040372.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Jun+26%2C+1960&amp;author=&amp;pub=Boston+Globe+(1960-1979)&amp;desc=Hitchcock+Believes+Film-Going+Public+Has+Matured&amp;pqatl=google Newspaper article, Hitchcock Believes Film-Going Public Has Matured], Boston Globe, June 26, 1960&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2010}}
[[Image:City Hall and Park, Barre, VT.jpg|thumb|left|City Hall and park in c. 1910]]

On November 6, 1780, the land was granted to William Williams and 64 others. Originally called Wildersburgh, it included what is today both the town and city of Barre. It was first settled in 1788 by John Goldsbury and Samuel Rodgers, together with their families. But dissatisfied with the name Wildersburgh, citizens renamed the town after [[Isaac Barré]], a champion of the [[American Colonies]]. In 1895, 4.0&amp;nbsp;square miles (10.4&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) within the town was set off and incorporated as the separate city.

===Granite industry===
[[Image:BarreGranite.jpg|thumb|left|Sample of the [[Barre Granite]] from the E. L. Smith Quarry of the Rock of Ages Stone Company, [[Graniteville, Vermont]]]]
Barre is the self-proclaimed &quot;[[Granite]] Center of the World.&quot; Initially established with the discovery of vast granite deposits at Millstone Hill soon after the [[War of 1812]], the granite industry and the city itself saw a boom with the arrival of the [[railroad]]. The fame of this vast deposit of granite, which some geologists say is {{convert|4|mi|km}} long, {{convert|2|mi|km}} wide and {{convert|10|mi|km}} deep, soon spread to [[Europe]] and [[Canada]]. Large numbers of people migrated to Barre from [[Italy]], [[Scotland]], [[Spain]], [[Scandinavia]], [[Greece]], [[Lebanon]], Canada and a number of other countries. The population increased from 2,060 in 1880, to 6,790 in 1890, to 10,000 in 1894. By the turn of the century, Barre was noted as the state's most diverse municipality.

The Italian immigrants in particular brought a radical, largely [[anarchist]] labor movement to Barre. They were originally affiliated with the [[Socialist Labor Party]] before affiliating with the [[Industrial Workers of the World]], and in 1916 and in 1929 the city elected a [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist Party]] candidate as mayor of Barre. The old [[Socialist Labor Party Hall]] of the radicals is still standing, and was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2000.

&quot;Barre Gray&quot; granite is sought after worldwide for its fine grain, even texture, and superior weather resistance. Many sculpture artists prefer it for outdoor sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;Rich, Jack C., (1988) ''Materials and Methods of Sculpture,'' Dover Publications&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936 the granite quarry in Barre carved out a 35 ton cross from one section of stone in the quarry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=lNsDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA573&amp;dq=Popular+Science+1936+plane+%22Popular+Mechanics%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=YQxKTqCgIeSDsgK6xpzSCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Popular%20Science%201936%20plane%20%22Popular%20Mechanics%22&amp;f=true &quot;Thirty-Five Ton Granite Cross from One Piece of Stone&quot; ''Popular Mechanics'', April 1936] article bottom of page 573&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hope Cemetery]] in Barre displays extensive examples of the sculptors' art.

==Geography and climate==
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 4.0&amp;nbsp;square miles (10.4&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), all land. Barre is drained by the Stevens Branch River and [[Jail Branch River]], [[tributary|tributaries]] of the [[Winooski River]].

The city is served by [[Interstate 89]], [[U.S. Route 302]], [[Vermont Route 14]] and [[Vermont Route 62]]. It is bordered by the town of [[Berlin, Vermont|Berlin]] to the west, but is otherwise surrounded by the separate town of [[Barre (town), Vermont|Barre]].

'''Newport''' is a city in and the shire town&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leg.state.vt.us/statutes/fullsection.cfm?Title=24&amp;Chapter=001&amp;Section=00011 Title 24, Part I, Chapter 1, §11], Vermont Statutes.  Accessed 2007-11-01.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[county seat]]){{GR|6}} of [[Orleans County, Vermont|Orleans County]], [[Vermont]], [[United States]]. As of the 2010 Census, the city population was 4,589. The city contains the largest population of any municipality in the county, yet encompasses the smallest area.

==History==
In 1753, the [[Abenaki]]s brought the ransomed [[John Stark]] down [[Lake Memphremagog]] and came ashore where Newport is now. They then traveled southeast to his home in [[New Hampshire]].

[[Rogers' Rangers]] were forced to retreat through the county following their attack on [[Saint-François-du-Lac, Quebec|Saint-Francis, Quebec]] in 1759. To confound their avenging pursuers, they split up on the east shore of Lake Memphremagog. One group followed the [[Clyde River (Vermont)|Clyde River]] east. Another followed the [[Barton River]] south.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Sketches of Orleans, Vermont |year=1985 |isbn=0-9610860-2-5 |publisher=Mempremagog Press |author=Darrell Hoyt}}, page 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Newport as a settlement began in 1793.&lt;ref&gt;''Columbia-Lippincott Gazeteer''. (New York: Columbia University Press, 1952) p. 1314&lt;/ref&gt;  The village was first called Pickeral Point, but later renamed Lake Bridge for its location at the head of Lake Memphremagog.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=OcoMAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;ots=cUndZkVSIF&amp;dq=coolidge%20mansfield%20history%20description%20new%20england%201859&amp;pg=PA862#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Austin J. Coolidge &amp; John B. Mansfield, ''A History and Description of New England;'' Boston, Massachusetts 1859]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 19th century, the women of pioneer Calvin Arnold's household, refused to live in the Arnold house near what is now Clyde Pond, because of depredations by the [[Native Americans of the United States|Indians]].&lt;ref name=&quot;elect&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Wheeler, Scott |title = The Man Who Helped Electrify the Jay Peak Ski Lift | publisher = Northland Journal | year = February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1816, part of the former town of Salem, was annexed to Newport town, and is now part of the city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.virtualvermont.com/towns/derby.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The railroad reached the village in 1863.&lt;ref name=&quot;nj100613&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | first=C. D. | last=Robinson | title=The Memphremagog House and ST. Albans Raid | url=| work=Newport Express and Standard, 1929 | publisher=Northland Journal | location=Newport, Vermont | pages= 10 | date=June 2010  | accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city had a scare when they received news of the [[St. Albans Raid]] during the American Civil
War. They thought these raids might repeat throughout the state but particularly at the south end of the lake. The militia was turned out.  The ferry from Magog was met with determined looking armed men, much to the captain's surprise, who had heard nothing about the raid. Armed [[Norwich University]] students were shipped in by train. Nothing happened and everyone was sent home in a few days.&lt;ref name=&quot;nj100613&quot;/&gt;

In 1868, the Lake Bridge settlement was incorporated as the Village of Newport.

It became a busy [[lumber]] town. The firm of Prouty &amp; Miller, a [[lumbering]] firm, was started in 1865. With the end of the lumbering concentration in Vermont, it went out of business in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=uTBCXqOou0YC&amp;pg=PA216&amp;lpg=PA216&amp;dq=%22prouty+and+miller%22+newport+vermont&amp;source=web&amp;ots=AJNK5pkDYR&amp;sig=OeN9H6kWbns503d-ErrwE3dg6R0&amp;hl=en#PPA6,M1 Vermont Almanac] accessed March 2, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Railroad Station, Newport, VT.jpg|thumb|left|Railroad station and steamboat ''Lady of the Lake'' in 1908]]

The ''Lady of the Lake'' [[steamboat|steam excursion/ferry boat]] started operating in 1867. It stopped operations in 1917. This is used as Newport's logo.

In 1868, a [[livery stable]] that would ultimately grow to 100 horses, started operating behind a hotel, several blocks from the railway station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Gibson, Peggy Day |title = The voice of harness racing | publisher = the Chronicle | date = August 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1873, the Bellevue Hotel was built to accommodate 75, and later, 100 guests. It was renamed the Newport House by 1891. It was demolished in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Emily M. |last=Nelson |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2009 |month=December |title=The History of the Newport House |journal=Vermont's Northland Journal |volume=8 |issue=9 |pages=8, 9  |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Newport Wharf Light was a tower built on Lake Memphremagog in 1879. It has since been demolished.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lhdepot.com/database/uniquelighthouse.cfm?value=1734 Lighthouses at Lighthouse Depot ... Lighthouse Explorer Database ... Newport Wharf Light]&lt;/ref&gt;

The current county courthouse was built in 1886.&lt;ref name=&quot;mark9&quot;&gt;Historic marker #9, Newport, Vermont&lt;/ref&gt; That was the year that the legislature moved the shire town here.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated4&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Young, Darlene |title = A history of Barton Vermont | publisher = Crystal Lake Falls Historical Association|year = 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 19th century, the [[Boston &amp; Maine Railroad|Boston &amp; Maine]] and [[Central Vermont Railway|Central Vermont]] [[railroad]]s were routed through Lake Bridge and the small village experienced a population boom.
[[Image:The Memphremagog House, Newport, VT.jpg|thumb|right|Memphremagog House c. 1880s, built in 1838 and burned in 1907]]

The now-historic [[Goodrich Memorial Library]] was built in 1899.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goodrichlibrary.org/history.htm Goodrich Memorial Library website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Memphremagog Hotel burned in 1907.&lt;ref name=&quot;nj0901&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Scott |last=Wheeler |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2009 |month=January |title=Boxing, Singing, and Riding the Rails into the Page of Newport's History |journal=Vermont's Northland Journal |volume=7 |issue=10 |pages=10  |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Main Street, Newport, VT.jpg|thumb|left|Main Street in 1908]]

In 1917, the city of Newport was formed from portions of the towns of [[Newport (town), Vermont|Newport]] (former village of Newport) and [[Derby, Vermont|Derby]] (former village of West Derby). It was organized on March 5, 1918.

The current federal courthouse was built in 1904. Then, it included the post office.&lt;ref name=&quot;mark9&quot;/&gt;

In 1917, the city paved Main Street. By 1930, 4,000 motor vehicles a day, during the summer, traveled the street.&lt;ref name=&quot;mark9&quot;/&gt;

In 1932, the city had a [[poor farm]] for the indigent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Scott | last=Wheeler | title=Life Down on the Community Poor Farm - Part 2 | url=| work= | publisher=Northland Journal | location=Derby, Vermont | pages= 27 | date=May 2012  | accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1942, a single-engined [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] training plane crashed into the lake near the west shore near the city, killing the only occupant, the pilot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | title=Salvage Operations on Crashed Plane Now Underway | url=| work= | publisher=the November 13, 1943 Newport Daily Express as quoted in the Northland Journal | location=Derby, Vermont | pages= 29–30 | date=September 2008  | accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!---&quot;near Strawberry Acres&quot;---&gt;

Between 1936 and 1953, the International Club in Newport had the largest dance floor in [[New England]], {{convert|220|by|60|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldstonehousemuseum.org/PDF/oshspring06.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; It was capable of holding 2,000 dancers. Various performers stopped to entertain while en route between [[Boston]] and [[Montreal]] on the railroad. These included: [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Charlie Barnet]], [[Les Brown (bandleader)|Les Brown]], [[Cab Calloway]], [[Rosemary Clooney]], the Dorsey Brothers, [[Jimmy Dorsey|Jimmy]] and [[Tommy Dorsey|Tommy]]; [[Stan Kenton]], [[Kay Kyser]], [[Gene Krupa]], [[Glenn Miller]], [[Tony Pastor (bandleader)|Tony Pastor]], and [[Louis Prima]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Old Stone House Museum |title = Big band dance to honor Korean War veterans | publisher = the Chronicle | date = June 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Goyette, Ray |title = Reader Reflects on the International Club | publisher = Vermont's Northland Journal | month = August | year = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From its founding, Newport's population plateaued around 5,000 people until 1950 when it started dropping. It reached bottom in 1990 at 4,434. In 2010 the population dropped from the 2000 census, and it still had not reached its 1950 high which was 5,217. In 2003, the Newport-headquartered Citizens Utility was sold and divided up among Great Bay Hydro and [[Vermont Electric Cooperative]].&lt;ref name=&quot;elect&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Wheeler, Scott |title = The Man Who Helped Electrify the Jay Peak Ski Area | publisher = Northland Journal | month = February | year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last passenger train left Newport in 1965.&lt;ref name=&quot;nj0901&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Scott |last=Wheeler |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2009 |month=January |title=Boxing, Singing, and Riding the Rails into the Page of Newport's History |journal=Vermont's Northland Journal |volume=7 |issue=10 |pages=17  |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city sold its [[Newport State Airport (Vermont)|airport]] to the state of Vermont in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Duane |last=Wright |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2009 |month=September |title=Up, Up and Away with Cecil Wright and His Flying Machines |journal=vermont's Northland Journal |volume=8 |issue=6 |pages=8  |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Vermont Teddy Bear Company]] once had a plant within the city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vermonteddybear.com/Gifts-Ideas/default/EMPLOYMENT.page Career Opportunities]&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Columbia Forest Products]] plant once employed about 100 workers.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Associated Press&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = The Associated Press |title = 54 workers laid off in Newport | publisher = Burlington Free Press | date = December 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A local subsidiary of [[Willy_Bogner,_Jr.#Life_and_work|an international ski clothing manufacturer]] once employed 30 workers.&lt;!---Bogners--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manta.com/coms2/dnbcompany_dhgdmg]&lt;/ref&gt; It closed in 2011.

==Geography==
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 7.6&amp;nbsp;square miles (19.7&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), of which 6.0&amp;nbsp;square miles (15.6&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) is land and 1.6&amp;nbsp;square miles (4.1&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) (20.87%) is water. The city surrounds the southern shore of [[Lake Memphremagog]]. Three of the four major rivers in the county empty into the lake here: the [[Clyde River (Vermont)|Clyde]], [[Barton River|Barton]], and the [[Black River (Lake Memphremagog)|Black]].

Newport borders the towns of [[Coventry, Vermont|Coventry]] to the south, [[Newport (town), Vermont|Newport]] to the west, and [[Derby, Vermont|Derby]] to the north and east.

It will cost about $5.26 million. The state will pay 90%, the city, the remainder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | first=Joseph | last=Gresser | title=Long Bridge to close for long time | url=| work= | publisher=the Chronicle | location=Barton, Vermont | pages= 8 | date=21 July 2010  | accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vergennes''' {{IPAc-en|v|ər|ˈ|dʒ|ɛ|n|z}} is a city located in the northwest quadrant of [[Addison County, Vermont]], in the United States. Bordered by the towns of [[Ferrisburgh, Vermont|Ferrisburgh]], [[Panton, Vermont|Panton]] and [[Waltham, Vermont|Waltham]], as of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]] the city population was 2,588, the smallest of Vermont's nine cities in terms of population (though the city of [[Winooski, Vermont|Winooski]] covers a smaller area). It was the first city chartered in the state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historicvermont.org/sites/html/history.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Vergennes, Charles Gravier comte de.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Charles Gravier, comte de Vergennes]]
Vergennes, first settled in 1766 by Donald MacIntosh, was established in 1788,&lt;ref name=cityweb/&gt; the only one of Vermont's cities not to have been first chartered as a town or independent village. Instead, portions of the pre-existing towns of [[New Haven, Vermont|New Haven]], [[Panton, Vermont|Panton]] and [[Ferrisburg, Vermont|Ferrisburg]] where they intersected at the Otter Creek Falls were drawn off to create Vergennes.&lt;ref name=cityweb/&gt; It is the smallest city (by population) in Vermont.

The city is named for [[Charles Gravier, comte de Vergennes|Charles Gravier]], [[Count|Comte]] de Vergennes.&lt;ref&gt;City of Vergennes. (n.d.). [http://www.vergennes.org/ ''City of Vergennes.''] Retrieved January 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; His hatred of the British and his desire for revenge for the [[French and Indian war]], made him support the American colonists during the [[American Revolutionary War]] and send arms and troops to the revolutionary cause.  He gave in to the demand of Beaumarchais to secretly procure arms and volunteers to the Americans. As directed by [[Louis XVI]], Gravier established a dummy company through which the Americans received nearly 80% of their military supplies. It was also Gravier who negotiated the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|1783 Treaty of Paris]], which formally brought the Revolutionary War to a close. 

Here, [[Thomas Macdonough]] built and armed the fleet that would defeat the British on Lake Champlain during the [[War of 1812]]. The Monkton Iron Company (which was at the time the largest iron works in the colonies) manufactured the fittings for Macdonough's fleet, as well as most of the cannon shot used by the army in the north. The ore used was mined in nearby [[Monkton, Vermont|Monkton]].

The motive for a city form of municipal government is said to have been to provide a vision for building the area as an industrial center. The Otter Creek Falls and close access to the [[Lake Champlain]] waterway was thought to be a fertile place for commercial growth.

Industry boomed in the late nineteenth century, in particular, shipping connected to the Champlain Canal and wood-finishing related to lumber imported from Canada. As railways supplanted the canal system, manufacturing declined. A railroad spur from Ferrisburgh to the base of the falls proved a failure, with grades too steep for practical operations.

Commercial decline continued in the twentieth century, narrowing down to a few surviving companies; as the twenty-first opened, a group of civic boosters and merchants improved the downtown area along Main Street. The resultant 'boutique Vergennes', catering to tourists and transients, is hampered by centralization of land ownership and resultant escalation of commercial rents.

==Geography==
[[Image:HPIM0003.JPG|thumb|right|Vergennes City Hall, Opera House, and Police Station]]
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 2.5&amp;nbsp;square miles (6.5&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), of which 2.4&amp;nbsp;square miles (6.2&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) is land and 0.1&amp;nbsp;square mile (0.3&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) (4.00%) is water.

The city's borders form a rectangle, nearly a square. [[Otter Creek (Vermont)|Otter Creek]] flows north through the town. In the middle of town is a 37-foot waterfall, with a large basin which occasionally floods.

'''St. Albans City''' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leg.state.vt.us/statutes/fullsection.cfm?Title=24&amp;Chapter=001&amp;Section=00007 Title 24, Part I, Chapter 1, §7], Vermont Statutes.  Accessed 2007-11-01.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[county seat]]){{GR|6}} [[Franklin County, Vermont|Franklin County]], [[Vermont]], in the [[United States]]. At the [[United States Census, 2010|2010 census]], the city population was 6,918. St Albans City is surrounded by [[St. Albans (town), Vermont|St. Albans]] [[New England town|town]], which is incorporated separately from the city of St. Albans. The city and area are part of the [[Burlington-South Burlington, VT Metropolitan Statistical Area]].

==History==
[[File:Main Street Looking North, St. Albans, VT.jpg|thumb|left|Main Street in 1909]]
One of the [[New Hampshire grants]], St. Albans was chartered by Colonial Governor [[Benning Wentworth]] on August 17, 1763 to Stephen Pomeroy and 63 others. Named after [[St. Albans]] in [[Hertfordshire]], [[England]], it was first settled during the [[American Revolution|Revolution]] by Jesse Welden. The war, however, delayed further settlement until 1785, when many others began arriving. Farmers found the rich, dark [[loam]] suitable for [[Tillage|cultivation]], as well as for the raising of [[cattle]], [[horse]]s and [[sheep]]. [[Butter]] and [[cheese]] were produced in great quantities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=OcoMAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;ots=cUndZkVSIF&amp;dq=coolidge%20mansfield%20history%20description%20new%20england%201859&amp;pg=PA906#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Austin J. Coolidge &amp; John B. Mansfield, ''A History and Description of New England;'' Boston, Massachusetts 1859]&lt;/ref&gt; It also became known as &quot;Railroad City,&quot; home to a major [[train station|depot]], operations center and repair shop of the [[Vermont and Canada Railroad]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.virtualvermont.com/towns/stalbans.html Virtual Vermont -- St. Albans]&lt;/ref&gt;  When the village was incorporated in 1859,&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=7n99eBPfOZ8C&amp;pg=PA15#v=onepage&amp;q=incorporated&amp;f=false Advantages, Resources and Attractions of St. Albans, Vt., 1889]&lt;/ref&gt; it had an [[iron]] [[foundry]], a manufacturer of [[freight car]]s, and a large number of [[mechanic]] shops.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=OcoMAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;ots=cUndZkVSIF&amp;dq=coolidge%20mansfield%20history%20description%20new%20england%201859&amp;pg=PA906#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Austin J. Coolidge &amp; John B. Mansfield, ''A History and Description of New England;'' Boston, Massachusetts 1859]&lt;/ref&gt;

The northernmost engagement of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], known as the [[St. Albans Raid]], occurred here on October 19, 1864. In 1902, the City of St. Albans was incorporated, comprising two square miles (518 hectares) within the town of [[St. Albans (town), Vermont|St. Albans]]. Today, it is a [[tourist destination]] noted for its [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] and [[American Craftsman|Craftsman]] style [[architecture]] built during the railroad era, when over 200 trains a day passed through.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stamuseum.com/ St. Albans Historical Society]&lt;/ref&gt; St. Albans is a research target for [[genealogy|genealogists]], as [[Europe]]an [[immigrant]]s heading for the United States would sometimes land at [[City of Halifax|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]] or [[Montreal, Canada|Montreal]], then take a train through the border crossing here.  The [[United States National Archives|National Archives]] (NARA) lists for St. Albans cover the period 1895-1954.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~holdenclan/albans.htm Genealogical lists -- St. Albans, Vermont]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
St. Albans is called &quot;The [[Maple Syrup]] Capital of the World,&quot; and in late April sponsors the annual Vermont [[Sugar Maple|Maple]] Festival. The festival includes many different food-related contests, as well as a footrace from [[Swanton (town), Vermont|Swanton]], 8.2 miles (13.2&amp;nbsp;km) to the north.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Vermont Maple Festival | publisher = Vermont Maple Festival | url = http://www.vtmaplefestival.org/ | accessdate = 2009-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
