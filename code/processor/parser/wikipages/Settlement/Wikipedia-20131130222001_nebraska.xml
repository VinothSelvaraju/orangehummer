Retrieved 2010-03-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1866, the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] reached present-day Schuyler, at the time known as Shell Creek Station. Three years later, the [[Nebraska State Legislature]] divided large Platte County into three smaller counties, including Colfax County.  In 1870, Shell Creek Station was renamed Schuyler.&lt;ref name =&quot;City of Schuyler official website: History&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Schuyler, Nebraska|url=http://www.ci.schuyler.ne.us/history.asp|accessdate=2012-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1870, the Union Pacific chose the town as the point at which Texas [[cattle]] being driven north would be loaded onto trains. With this, Schuyler became Nebraska's first &quot;cow town&quot;. However, the resulting boom, which saw a six-fold increase in the town's population (from 100 to 600) and around 50,000 head of cattle pass through, was only temporary: the next year, the terminus of the cattle trail had moved west to [[Kearney, Nebraska|Kearney]].&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite book | last =Olson | first =James C. | title =History of Nebraska (Second Edition) | publisher =University of Nebraska Press | year =1966 | location =Lincoln, Nebraska | pages =186–87 | isbn =0-8032-5790-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city's early residents were [[Czechs|Czech]], [[Irish people|Irish]], and [[Germans|German]] settlers.  Settlement was enabled by Schuyler's geographic position, which caused the community to be associated with a number of historic overland transportation routes, including:
* [[Oregon Trail]] (1836–1869)
* [[Mormon Trail]] (1840s–1850s)
* [[Transcontinental Railway]] (1866–present)
* Coast-to-Coast [[Lincoln Highway]] (1913–1925)

With the establishment of Cargill Meat Solutions packaging plant, the demographics of Schuyler have undergone rapid and lasting change. It is at present one of Nebraska's most predominantly Hispanic communities.

==Attractions==
[[File:Christ the King Priory, Schuyler, NE.jpg|thumb|Christ the King Priory]]

In 1935, monks from the [[Ottilien Congregation|Congregation of Missionary Benedictines of Saint Ottilien]] established a community in Schuyler as a means of supporting the Congregation's missions in Africa and Asia. At present, [[Christ the King Priory]] is home to eleven monks. The monks' apostolate has expanded to providing retreats at the recently constructed [[Christ the King Priory|Saint Benedict Center]], four miles north of Schuyler.&lt;ref&gt;The Schuyler Sun, Volume 113 No. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Imperial''' is a city in [[Chase County, Nebraska|Chase County]], [[Nebraska]], [[United States]]. The population was 2,071 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. It is the [[county seat]] of [[Chase County, Nebraska|Chase County]].{{GR|6}}

==History==
The original town of Imperial was built on land homesteaded by Thomas Mercier and M.L. Goodrich. These men gave a town lot to anyone who would put up a building and help to start the town.  Mercier was the first Post Master and took office on December 14, 1885.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casde.unl.edu/history/counties/chase/imperial/ Univ. of Nebraska, Virtual Nebraska]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The railroad right of way was graded to Imperial in 1888.  The railroad reached Imperial on August 15, 1892.  It was built by a division of the [[Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad]]. This line left the main line near [[Culbertson, Nebraska|Culbertson]] and terminated in Imperial.

When the grade was completed the Lincoln Land Company gave lots to all those who would move their buildings to the &quot;Railroad Addition&quot;.  Nearly all of the buildings were moved south to the future railroad line and the present location of the business district of the town was established.

==History==

===19th century===
In 1887, [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway]] built a branch line from [[Neva, Kansas|Neva]] (3 miles west of [[Strong City, Kansas|Strong City]]) to Superior.  At some point, the line from [[Neva, Kansas|Neva]] to [[Lost Springs, Kansas|Lost Springs]] was pulled but the right of way has not been abandoned.  This branch line was originally called &quot;Strong City and Superior line&quot; but later the name was shortened to the &quot;Strong City line&quot;.  In 1996, the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway]] merged with [[Burlington Northern Railroad]] and renamed to the current [[BNSF Railway]].  Most locals still refer to this railroad as the &quot;Santa Fe&quot;.

===20th century===
Superior was one of the smallest cities in America that supported a professional minor league baseball team, the [[Superior Senators]] (1956–58) of the [[Nebraska State League]].  Superior was the first professional stop in the career of pitcher [[Jim Kaat]], who went on to win 283 games in a 24-year Major League career.

'''Oakland''' is a city in [[Burt County, Nebraska|Burt County]], [[Nebraska]], [[United States]]. The population was 1,244 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. Oakland continues to build on its strong foundation with its bi-annual Swedish Festival and is known by its proclamation from the Swedish [[Consul-General]] and Nebraska Governor as the &quot;Swedish Capital of Nebraska.&quot;

==Geography==
Oakland is located at {{Coord|41|50|6|N|96|27|58|W|type:city}} (41.835133, -96.466075){{GR|1}}.
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|0.93|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, all of it land.&lt;ref name =&quot;Gazetteer files&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Oakland was named after John Oak, who settled in this area with 23 other pioneers. John Oak and his wife, Inger Askwig Oak, were among a band of pioneers who struggled in from Ottawa, a Norwegian-American settlement in [[LaSalle County, Illinois]] in July 1855. Oak then assisted Swedish immigrant families to settle in the Logan Creek Valley in 1866. The village was incorporated April 13, 1881, with 30 businesses, two banks and one printing office in operation. Basic economic activities in the Oakland area soon included farming, cattle and hog production, feed processing, wholesale and retail sales. In 1900, the [[Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad]] were built to Oakland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ci.oakland.ne.us/  ''Valkommen (Welcome) to Oakland,Swedish Capital of Nebraska!'' (Welome to Oakland)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Oakland was home to the Swedish Basketball Classic from 1993-2006, which has since moved to Midland University in Fremont, NE and changed its name to the Warrior Classic. Oakland has also been home to the Burt County Fair since 1913.

'''Stromsburg''' is a city in [[Polk County, Nebraska|Polk County]], [[Nebraska]], [[United States]]. The population was 1,171 at the [[United States Census, 2010|2010 census]].

== History ==

Stromsburg was settled early in Nebraska history. A group of [[Sweden|Swedish]] settlers coming from the town of [[Ockelbo]]  arrived in the 1860s after several years in [[Illinois]]. This group had a leader named Lewis Headstrom, who was a real estate agent. Seeing some similarities to their old Swedish homeland the settlers formed what would be called Stromsburg, named after a section of Ockelbo, Sweden. By the 1880s two brickyards were in operation in the town. Many buildings from ‘native’ brick still stand, including the Viking Center, now a community center that was originally The Opera House; the Cornerstone Bank; two businesses on the east side of the square; and several homes. Brick streets still surround the city square in Stromsburg. A brick Carnegie library was built in Stromsburg in 1918. The downtown area of Stromsburg has a town square in its center. This square forms a park, with lawns and mature trees, where festivals and events are held. In the center of the square is a  two story Swedish style building made of brick with decorative toll painting and the phrase &quot;Välkommen&quot; (Swedish for &quot;Welcome&quot;).

Stromsburg was given the title of the “Swede Capital of Nebraska” by Governor [[Frank B. Morrison]] in 1966 at the Swedish Festival.  The Swedish festival is held in June each year and showcases Stromburg's Swedish heritage.

[[Stromsburg Public School]] was established in 1887. It operated until 2002, when the Stromsburg district consolidated with [[Benedict, Nebraska]] to form [[Cross County Community School]].

'''Central City''' is a city in [[Merrick County, Nebraska|Merrick County]], [[Nebraska]], [[United States]]. It is part of the [[Grand Island, Nebraska]] [[Grand Island micropolitan area|Micropolitan Statistical Area]].  The population was 2,934 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. It is the [[county seat]] of [[Merrick County, Nebraska|Merrick County]]{{GR|6}}.

==History==

===Early inhabitants===
The inhabitants just prior to the establishment of Lone Tree (Central City) were the [[Pawnee]]. In the late 1700s, the Chaui had a village on the current location of Central City.  An account that an old Chaui man gave to Major [[Frank North]] in 1875 about a battle that took place between two divisions of the Pawnee (the Chaui, Pitahauerit, and Kitkehahki, jointly known as the Southern Pawnee, on one side; and the [[Skidi]] on the other) in the late 1700s illustrates the political complexities of the early inhabitants of what would come to be Central City.&lt;ref name = &quot;grinnell&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=[[George Bird Grinnell|Grinnell]]|first=George Bird|title=Grinnell writes about the Pawnee|journal=NEBRASKA HISTORY AND RECORD OF PIONEER DAYS|year=1920|month=April–June|volume=III|issue=2|url=http://www.usgennet.org/usa/ne/topic/resources/OLLibrary/Journals/HPR/Vol03/nhrv03p2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There had been considerable rivalry between the Chaui and the Skidi, which eventually led to an unprovoked attack by the Skidi on a group of Chaui hunting buffalo. It was estimated that 200 Chaui were killed. All were men from the Chaui village, which was near [[Lone Tree Monument, Nebraska|Lone Tree]] and where Central City is now located. The surviving Chaui returned to their village (this was thought to have occurred during winter). The Chaui did not believe they were strong enough to attack the Skidi, so they held councils with two other Southern Pawnee bands and told them what happened.  The Pitahauerit and Kitkehahki decided to help the Chaui against the Skidi.&lt;ref name = &quot;grinnell&quot;/&gt; 

The men of the three villages crossed the Platte River and made a night march to the Skidi village. Some of the men dressed as buffaloes in order to entice the Skidi out of their village to hunt buffalo.   The rest of the men hid along the river and behind the ridge of sandhills next to the river.  The Skidi charged between the men hiding along the river and behind the sandhill ridge thinking that they were chasing buffalo; the Southern Pawnees attacked them there.&lt;ref name = &quot;grinnell&quot;/&gt;
 
All of the Skidi men who had not gone out to hunt the buffaloes came out of the village and joined buffalo hunters who had initially escaped, preparing to make a last stand. Grinnell's Chaui informant estimated that more than 400 Skidi men were killed.  The Chaui and the Pitahauerat wanted to exterminate the Skidi, but the Kitkehaki disagreed, arguing that the Skidi were the same people as they and should not be eradicated. The three bands argued for some time, but the Kitkehaki won the argument. They told the Skidi that they wanted to talk and Skidi subsequently agreed to their terms. The Southern Pawnees took much of the Skidi property, including many horses. Many of the Skidi women were forced to marry into the other villages to establish family ties among villages of Pawnee.&lt;ref name = &quot;grinnell&quot;/&gt;

===Founding of Lone Tree===
The first pioneers passed by what would eventually become Central City on the [[Mormon Trail]] in 1847 and later on the [[Oregon Trail]] and the [[California Trail]]. This location was close to a huge [[Populus deltoides|cottonwood]] tree, called [[Lone Tree Monument|Lone Tree]], that the pioneers used on these trails as a landmark.  In 1858, the [[Nebraska Legislature|Nebraska Territorial Legislature]] establish Merrick county named after Elvira Merrick, the wife of a [[Dodge County, Nebraska|Dodge County]] Nebraska Territorial legislator who introduced the bill creating Merrick County.  A yet to be established county seat was called &quot;Elvira&quot; and was said to be located under Lone Tree.&lt;ref name =&quot;Kay&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Kay|first=John, Lonnie Dickson, Robert Kay, and Kathleen Fimple (1992)|title=Nebraska Historic Buildings Survey Reconnaissance Survey Final Report of Merrick County, Nebraska.|url=http://www.nebraskahistory.org/histpres/reports/merrick_county.pdf|publisher=Nebraska State Historical Society: State Historic Preservation Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It was not until 1866 that an actual county seat was created near the mythical location of Elvira and renamed &quot;Lone Tree.&quot; It was established as the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] was laying tracks through Merrick County.  In 1868, J.H.Berryman built the first substantial building, which functioned as a general store, hotel, bar, court house,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nebraska national Register Sites in Merrick County|url=http://www.nebraskahistory.org/histpres/nebraska/merrick.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; revival meeting hall, and his home.  The first courthouse was built in 1871 and was replaced by the [[Merrick County Courthouse|current court house]] in 1912.&lt;ref name =&quot;Kay&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cc&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Nancy B.|title=Central City -- Merrick County|url=http://www.casde.unl.edu/history/counties/merrick/centralcity/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =&quot;cc1&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Merrick County Historical Society|title=History of Merrick County, Dallas|year=1981|publisher=Taylor publishing Company|location=Dallas, TX}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =&quot;cc2&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Merrick County Historical Society|title=History of Merrick County-Volume II|publisher=Taylor Publishing Company|location=Dallas, TX}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Name change===
In 1875 a petition was presented to the Merrick County Court requesting a name change for Lone Tree to &quot;Central City&quot;. Proponents of change argued that the name &quot;Lone Tree&quot;, gave the impression that the area was desolate and the inhabitants were poor and uncivilized, which would not bring in new settlers and thereby limit the growth of the area. Opponents to change countered that &quot;Lone Tree&quot; portrayed a &quot;beautiful spot and is a name dear to the pioneers.&quot; The proponents of change won out and on July 1, 1875, the name was officially changed to from &quot;Lone Tree&quot; to &quot;Central City.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cc&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name =&quot;cc1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name =&quot;cc2&quot;/&gt;

===Boom town===
By 1880s, Central City was a &quot;boom&quot; town after the arrival of a second railroad, the [[Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad|Burlington &amp; Missouri River]].  During this time of peak growth, three banks were built, in addition to a hardware store, a roller mill, two newspapers, three lumberyards, a cracker factory, a cigar factory, a new brick school, nine churches, and a college. The college was Nebraska Central College, which opened in 1885 as a Methodist college and the first high school were built.&lt;ref name=&quot;cc&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name =&quot;cc1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name =&quot;cc2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=The Nebraska State Historical Society|title=Nebraska: A Guide to the Cornhusker State (WPA Guide)|year=1939|publisher=The Viking Press: New York|pages=424|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1001&amp;context=nebraskianapubs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first newspaper in Central City was ''The Merrick County News,'' which published its first addition on March 21, 1872.  A second news paper, the ''Sentinel,'' a &quot;railroad&quot; paper, started on April 10, 1873, but only lasted a short time.  In 1874, ''The Merrick County News'' became the ''Courier''.  In 1880, the ''Merrick County Item'' was first published, but only lasted until 1881.  In 1882, the ''Nonpareil'' opened and Central City again had two newspapers.&lt;ref name =&quot;HN&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Andreas|first=A. T.|title=History of the State of Nebraska|year=1882|publisher=The Western Historical Company|location=Chicago|url=http://www.kancoll.org/books/andreas_ne/hon_cnty.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MCL&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Merrick County Lookups|url=http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nemerric/lookups.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

By the 1890s, economic growth had slowed. In 1890, the ''Courier'' closed and Nebraska Central College closed in 1891.  A flood washed out both the Union Pacific and Burlington railroad tracks.  By the mid-1890s, economic conditions were improving.  Two new newspapers opened: the ''Record'' in 1895 (which would close in 1908) and ''Republican'' in 1896 (which would merge with the ''Nonpareil'' to form the current ''Republican-Nonpareil'' in 1953).&lt;ref name=&quot;MCL&quot;/&gt;  The Society of Friends (Quakers) reopened Nebraska Central College in 1899.&lt;ref name =&quot;Kay&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cc&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name =&quot;cc1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name =&quot;cc2&quot;/&gt;

The early 1900s saw the construction of a new courthouse (1911–1913), the [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Merrick County, Nebraska|historic]] Martha Elllen Auditorium (1916, earlier an opera house), and a new high school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Nebraska State Gazetteer and Business Directory, Vol. XVI|year=1917|publisher=Polk-McAvoy Directory Co.|location=Omaha, Nebraska|url=http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nemerric/olres/busgaz17.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Economic growth was aided in the 1920s by the opening of a branch of Omaha Cold Storage in 1927, allowing farmers to sell their poultry and eggs locally at better prices.  Perhaps the most notable citizen of Central City, [[Wright Morris]], lived here from 1910 to 1919.&lt;ref name=&quot;cc&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name =&quot;cc1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name =&quot;cc2&quot;/&gt;

===1930s to the present===
A library was built just before the [[Great Depression]], but little construction occurred during the 1930s.  In the 1940s, construction resumed when a hospital was built and a gymnasium was added for the high school. In the 1950s, Nebraska Central College closed (1953) but a new hospital was built in 1959. In 1975, an explosion and fire destroyed an entire city block, but Central City still reached its largest population to date at 3,083 people in 1980. Central City's population has declined slightly since then.&lt;ref name=&quot;cc&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name =&quot;cc1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name =&quot;cc2&quot;/&gt;

'''Red Cloud''' is a city in and the [[county seat]] of [[Webster County, Nebraska|Webster County]], [[Nebraska]], [[United States]].{{GR|6}} The population was 1,020 at the [[United States Census, 2010|2010 census]].

==History==
The region of present-day Red Cloud was intermittently occupied and used as hunting grounds by the [[Pawnee people|Pawnees]] until 1833.  In that year, a treaty was signed in which the Pawnees surrendered their lands south of the [[Platte River]].  According to [[George E. Hyde|George Hyde]], it is likely that the Pawnees did not realize that they were thereby giving up their lands, and that they were led to believe that they were only granting the [[Lenape|Delawares]] and other relocated tribes permission to hunt in the area.&lt;ref name=hyde&gt;Hyde, George E.  ''Pawnee Indians''.  University of Denver Press, 1951.  p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1870, the area that is now Webster County was opened to [[Homestead Act|homesteaders]].  In that year, [[Silas Garber]] and other settlers filed claims along Crooked Creek, just east of the present-day city.  In 1871, the town, named after the renowned [[Oglala Lakota]] leader [[Red Cloud]], was voted county seat of the newly formed county.

'''Weeping Water''' is a city in [[Cass County, Nebraska|Cass County]], [[Nebraska]], [[United States]]. The population was 1,050 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].

==Geography==
Weeping Water is located at {{coord|40|52|4|N|96|8|21|W|type:city}} (40.867854, -96.139205){{GR|1}}.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|0.97|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, all of it land.&lt;ref name =&quot;Gazetteer files&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weeping Water is best known for its limestone quarry. Every year, late in June, the town celebrates Limestone Day with a parade, fireworks and games.

The Indians named the stream running through Weeping Water NIGAHOE, meaning &quot;water rustling&quot;, the sound of water running over the low falls. When the French came, they confused the NIGAHOE with another Indian word, NIGAHOAGE, meaning &quot;water weeping&quot; and gave the stream the French name L'EAU QUI PLEURE, meaning &quot;water which weeps&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

In the 1920s a poet composed &quot;The Ballad of Weeping Water&quot; giving a romantic flavor to the village's name. It tells of two tribes of Indians battling in the valley. A fight so bloody that braves from each side were slaughtered. The squaws and maidens of both tribes wept. For hours and hours they wept until their tears began to make trickling streams, which flowed into the valley where they formed a creek. The Indians named this creek “Weeping Water,” and it has been flowing ever since.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

'''Ashland''' is a city in [[Saunders County, Nebraska|Saunders County]], [[Nebraska]], [[United States]]. The population was 2,453 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].

==History==
Ashland is located at the site of a low-water limestone ledge along the bottom of [[Salt Creek (Nebraska)|Salt Creek]], an otherwise mud-bottomed stream that was a formidable obstacle for wagon trains on the great westward migrations of the late 1840s and 1850s. The Oxbow Trail, a variant route of the [[Oregon Trail]], ran from [[Nebraska City, Nebraska|Nebraska City]] (on the [[Missouri River]]) to [[Fort Kearny]] (on the [[Platte River]]), where it joined the main route of the Oregon Trail.  The limestone bottom of Salt Creek at Ashland made it an excellent fording site.  A trading post, '''Saline Ford''', developed at the ford.  A village, '''Flora City''', was platted on the hills overlooking the ford.  These twin towns later incorporated as Ashland.

Today, Ashland benefits by its proximity to [[Interstate 80]] and the cities of [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]] and [[Lincoln, Nebraska|Lincoln]].  While in some respects Ashland is becoming a &quot;bedroom community&quot; of those much larger cities, it retains a rural character. That coherence as a community, and a 30-minute drive to either of the state's economic hubs, has led to a building boom in the late 1990s and the 2000s.

Ashland is the hometown of astronaut [[Clayton Anderson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Astronaut Biography: Clayton C. Anderson |work=National Aeronautics and Space Administration |url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/htmlbios/anderson-c.html |month=January | year=2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ogallala''' is a city in [[Keith County, Nebraska|Keith County]], [[Nebraska]], [[United States]]. The population was 4,737 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. It is the [[county seat]] of [[Keith County, Nebraska|Keith County]]{{GR|6}}. In the days of the [[Nebraska Territory]], the city was a stop on the [[Pony Express]] and later along the [[First transcontinental railroad (North America)|transcontinental railroad]]. The [[Ogallala Aquifer]] was named after the city.

==History==
Ogallala first gained fame as a terminus for [[Cattle drives in the United States|cattle drives]] that traveled from [[Texas]] to the [[Union Pacific Railroad|Union Pacific]] railhead located there.  These trails are known as the Western or Great Western trails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/WW/ayw2.html|last= Skaggs| first= Jimmy M. |work=Handbook of Texas Online  |title=WESTERN TRAIL |publisher=exas State Historical Association |accessdate=2010-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greatwesterncattletrail.com/along_gwct_a/along_gwct.html|last= Busby| first= Myra |title=Along The Great Western Cattle Trail |publisher=www.greatwesterncattletrail.com |accessdate=2010-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Union Pacific Railroad reached Ogallala on May 24, 1867.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uprr.com/aboutup/maps/graphics/goldspik.gif|work= Historical Maps of the Union Pacific |title=Union Pacific End of Track Dateline 1865-1869 |format= GIF |publisher= Union Pacific Railroad Company|accessdate=2010-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The city itself was not laid out until 1875 and not incorporated until 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| contribution = Ogallala, Nebraska  | year = 1952  | title = Columbia Lippincott Gazetteer of the world: Lippincott's pronouncing gazetteer  | editor-last = Seltzer  | editor-first = Leon| page = 1378  | place = New York  | publisher = Columbia University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only cemetery in Ogallala between 1874 and 1884 was the [[Boot Hill]]. Over 100 people were buried there, which is significant because the town had a population of less than 130 permanent residents at the time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nekeith/boothill.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The town's name comes from the [[Oglala Sioux]] tribe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=history of ogallala...|url=http://www.ogallala-ne.gov/Community/COM_History.htm|work=Official Website, City of Ogallala|publisher=City of Ogallala|accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Old West gunman [[Luke Short]] lived for a time in Ogallala.

'''Friend''' is a city in [[Saline County, Nebraska|Saline County]], [[Nebraska]], [[United States]]. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the city population was 1,027.

==History==
The city is named for Charles E. Friend who homesteaded the land and initially named the community Friendville.  He operated a dry goods store and post office.  In 1873 the [[Burlington and Missouri River Railroad]] named its new train station there &quot;Friend.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ci.friend.ne.us/geninfo.htm Friend, Nebraska -ci.friend.ne.us]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Greyhound Association]] was founded in the community in 1906 (called at the time National [[Coursing]] Association).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ngagreyhounds.com/History.asp History of the Greyhound and Greyhound Racing - The Greyhound Review, February 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Friend Police Department, which was initially housed in a tool shed during construction of [[U.S. Route 6]] was reported to be the smallest police station in the world according to [[Ripley's Believe It or Not]].  In the 1960s the shed doubled in size so the [[Nebraska State Patrol]] could also be stationed there.  Friend still claims it has the smallest combined police station.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ci.friend.ne.us/tourism.htm Friend, Nebraska -ci.friend.ne.us]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1859, following complaints of [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]] depredations against settlers in the [[Elkhorn River]] valley, a combined force of Nebraska Territorial Militia under the command of General [[John Milton Thayer]] and [[2nd Stryker Cavalry Regiment (United States)|2nd U.S. Army Dragoons]] under Lieutenant [[Beverly Robertson|Beverly Holcombe Robertson]] prepared to attack a Pawnee village.  Rather than fighting, the Pawnees surrendered before the attack could be launched. Chief Petalesharu draped an American flag over his shoulders and held a peace pipe while confronting the soldiers to stop the fight from taking place,
&lt;ref&gt;[http://bcps.esu8.org/Community/History.htm &quot;bcps.esu8.org&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; ending the Pawnee War of 1859.  Although no battle occurred, the nearby stream was dubbed Battle Creek.  The town founded in the area in 1867 took the creek's name for itself.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Plattsmouth''' is a city and [[county seat]] of [[Cass County, Nebraska|Cass County]], [[Nebraska]], [[United States]].{{GR|6}}  The population was 6,502 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].

==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2010}}
The [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] passed the mouth of the [[Platte River]], just north of what is now Main Street Plattsmouth, on July 21, 1804.

Plattsmouth first appeared in 1854 as &quot;the Barracks&quot;, a trading post established by Sam Martin, owner of the Platteville ferry in neighboring [[Mills County, Iowa]], ferryman Wheatley Mickelwait, and [[Glenwood, Iowa]] attorney and politician Colonel Joseph Longworthy Sharp. The community was renamed Plattsmouth for its location at the mouth of the Platte River.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.epodunk.com/cgi-bin/genInfo.php?locIndex=27494|title=Profile for Plattsmouth, Nebraska, NE|publisher= ePodunk|accessdate= October 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
The organization of the city under the charter of March 1855&lt;ref name=&quot;The City of Plattsmouth Nebraska&quot;/&gt; was effected December 29, 1856, by the election of Wheatley Mickelwait to the Mayoralty, and Enos Williams, W. M. Slaughter and Jacob Vallery, Aldermen. This Council met and proceeded to business on January 29, 1857, their first ordinance, approved by the Mayor March 2, 1857, levying a tax of one-half of 1 per cent on all taxable property within the corporate limits of the city of Plattsmouth, the amount collected to be expended in the improvement of the streets and alleys and steamboat landings at and in the city. On December 7, 1857, the Council voted each member an annual salary of $100, being something over $16 apiece for each session held during the year. This is a noticeable fact, in view of the action taken by the succeeding Council on December 30, 1858, in ordaining that the Mayor and Alderman receive for their services during that year the sum of 5 cents each, payable in city scrip; the Assessor, Recorder and Treasurer being paid $25 apiece for the same term.

'''Falls City''' is a city in [[Richardson County, Nebraska|Richardson County]], [[Nebraska]], [[United States]]. The population was 4,325 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. It is the [[county seat]] of [[Richardson County, Nebraska|Richardson County]].{{GR|6}}

==History==
Falls City was founded in the summer of 1857 by James Lane, John Burbank, J.E. Burbank and Isaac L. Hamby. The town is located on the north side of the [[Big Nemaha River]]. The river in 1857 had banks and bed of rock and stone.  The town was located near where the river flowed over a four-foot rock ledge called the &quot;Falls of Nemaha&quot;, for which the town was named.  Over time the river has changed to the extent that the falls no longer exist.

The town was a stop on the [[Underground Railroad]] for escaping slaves during the struggles resulting from the [[Kansas-Nebraska Act]].  Early in the city's history, it won a prolonged process to become the county seat of Richardson County.  The county originally selected [[Salem, Nebraska]] to be the county seat, but due to Salem's lack of a suitable building site, a new election was held which Falls City tied in the vote.  Finally in a third election in 1860, Falls City was declared the permanent site of the county seat.

Falls City grew in the late 19th century due the arrival of the Atchison &amp; Nebraska Railroad in 1871 and the [[Missouri Pacific]] in 1882, for which Falls City was designated as a division point in 1909. The population of the city peaked at 6,200 citizens in 1950.

On August 6, 1966, [[Braniff Airlines Flight 250]] crashed near Falls City due to bad weather, killing all 42 on board.

In 1993, [[Brandon Teena]], a [[transgender]] person who had recently arrived in Falls City, was murdered by two acquaintances who, upon discovering that he was a female living as a male, had beaten and raped him about a week previously.  Brandon had reported the rape to the police, but the Richardson County sheriff had failed to take steps to protect him; in particular, he had not arrested the two alleged rapists.  Learning that the rape had been reported, the two tracked Brandon to a farmhouse near [[Humboldt, Nebraska|Humboldt]], where they killed him and two others.  Brandon's mother subsequently sued the sheriff and the county for negligence, wrongful death, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.  Briefs were filed in the case by thirty-four civil-rights groups, including the [[Lambda Legal|Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund]]; the matter eventually came before the [[Nebraska Supreme Court]], which found the county negligent in failing to protect Brandon.&lt;ref name=supreme/&gt;&lt;ref name=cbs/&gt;  The episode was dramatized in a 1999 film titled ''[[Boys Don't Cry (film)|Boys Don't Cry]]''; actress [[Hilary Swank]] received an [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] for her portrayal of Brandon.&lt;ref name=slate/&gt;&lt;ref name=nissen/&gt;

==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2009}}

Clay Center was laid out in the summer of 1879. An election on November 4, 1879, confirmed Clay Center as the location for the Clay County seat following months of heated competition with rivals Sutton and Harvard. W. D. Young erected the first building on the site, a frame structure, which was used as the temporary courthouse. In February 1887 Clay Center became an incorporated village. 

Industrial development began in 1903 when M. M. Johnson built a factory to manufacture &quot;Old Trusty&quot; poultry incubators and brooders that were sold nationwide. The factory provided employment for hundreds of local citizens. The Johnson Company established radio station KMMJ in 1925 to promote its products, and the station made Clay Center a well-known and respected name in farm homes throughout the Midwest. 

Clay Center experienced dramatic change in 1942 when a Naval Ammunition Depot was built just west of town to produce bombs and shells during World War II. This property was later transferred to the U.S. Department of Agriculture and has been designated by Congress as the Roman L. Hruska U.S. Meat Animal Research Center.

[[File:Meat Market, Gretna NB.jpg|thumb|Meat Market in Gretna, circa 1895]]

'''Gretna''' is a city in [[Sarpy County, Nebraska|Sarpy County]], [[Nebraska]], [[United States]]. The population was 4,441 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. Gretna has the fastest rate of growth of any Nebraska city since 2000{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}.

==History==
Gretna started shortly after the [[Burlington Railroad]] built a short line between [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]] and [[Ashland, Nebraska|Ashland]] in the summer of 1886. Advent of the village of Gretna on this new laid rail line was the cue for the exit of the nearby trading post of Forest City, which had existed since 1856. In its day, Forest City, located 2.5 miles southwest of where Gretna now stands, was a flourishing and busy place, but it was doomed by the rail road which passed it by. The only marker that exists today to show the site of old Forest City is the cemetery (Holy Sepulcher) which is located a little the east of what was the center of activity in the settlement. Names that were prominent in the beginnings of Forest City were the families of William Langdon, John Thomas and John Conner.

The Lincoln Land Company, recognizing the potential of the site, surveyed and plotted the town site of Gretna in 1887. The village was incorporated by July 10, 1889. The name suggests Scotland's [[Gretna Green]], the ancestral county of some of the earliest settlers.

==Government==
Gretna has a non-partisan election every four years, in years divisible by four, for town mayor.  Two rounds are held, with the top two vote-getters in the primary advancing to the general election. The city is split into two wards, with two city council members elected from each ward; council members serve four-year terms.  The mayor and council meet twice a month.

==Geography==
Gretna is located at {{coord|41|8|20|N|96|14|42|W|type:city}} (41.138898, -96.244947).{{GR|1}}

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|2.10|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, all of it land.&lt;ref name =&quot;Gazetteer files&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nearest hospitals are Lakeside Hospital (9.5 miles away), located in [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]], or Midlands Hospital in [[Papillion, Nebraska|Papillion]] (11.4 miles). Papillion is also the location of the county courthouse.

'''Osceola''' is a city in, and the [[county seat]] of, [[Polk County, Nebraska|Polk County]], [[Nebraska]], [[United States]].{{GR|2}} The population was 880 as of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].

==History==
According to the [[University of Nebraska-Lincoln]], the first settlers of Osceola, which included the families of Reverend James Query and Vinson Perry Davis, arrived in October 1868. Davis is credited with naming the settlement after a [[Osceola, Iowa|city of the same name]] in [[Iowa]],&lt;ref name=&quot;osceola&quot;/&gt; which had been named after Chief [[Osceola]] of the [[Seminole]] people. After three years of settlement and disputes over the permanent location, the town itself was organized by [[frontiersman|frontiersmen]] William Francis Kimmel and John Hopwood Mickey in the early fall of 1871.  It had been decided in an election by a margin of 14 votes, prior to the formation that the &quot;geographic center of the county&quot; was best suited to be the settlement's site. A courthouse was erected the following spring and a general store was founded in May. During the summer, a post office was built, which served as a terminus between the cities of [[Lincoln, Nebraska|Lincoln]] and [[Ulysses, Nebraska|Ulysses]]. The town's  first full year concluded with the establishment of a public school. The following year brought [[Methodism]] to the town, and a church for the faith had been completed by 1878. In the succeeding year, [[Nebraska Wesleyan]] college was founded in the church, serving 11 students by means of 4 instructors. The school would later move to [[Fullerton, Nebraska|Fullerton]]. The Omaha and Republican Valley Railroad, reached the town in 1879 and named a [[locomotive]] after the city, however it was ultimately renamed the number &quot;9.&quot; Two years following the arrival of the railroad, the settlement was incorporated as a village on August 26, 1881 after accumulating a population of 200 citizens. The city would ultimately reach its peak of 1,200 residents in 1920.&lt;ref name=&quot;unl&quot;&gt;[http://www.casde.unl.edu/history/counties/polk/osceola/ Nebraska...Our Towns], University of Nebraska-Lincoln.&lt;/ref&gt;

A newspaper titled ''The Homesteader'' was established in August 1873. It was renamed the ''Osceola Record'' in March 1876, and as of 1995 it is known as the ''Polk County News''. It currently has a circulation of approximately 1,850 subscribers.&lt;ref name=&quot;facts&quot;/&gt;

The city experienced a [[drought]] from 1893-95.  During the final stages in 1895, much of the city was burned by a two-hour-long fire that left only two buildings standing.&lt;ref name=&quot;osceola&quot;&gt;[http://www.osceolanebraska.com Welcome to Osceola, Nebraska], Osceola.  Accessed 2009-04-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[sewage plant]] for the city was constructed in 1958 and expanded in 2007. Hanna Keelan from Lincoln, Nebraska was responsible for the formation of a comprehensive city plan formulated in 1985.&lt;ref name=&quot;facts&quot;/&gt;

In the city's centennial year of 1971, celebrations were held for the city and twenty years after this, festivities marked the 100th anniversary of St. Mary's Catholic Church just outside of town.&lt;ref name=&quot;unl&quot;/&gt;

'''Loup City''' is the [[county seat]] of [[Sherman County, Nebraska|Sherman County]],{{GR|6}} in the central portion of the Midwestern state of [[Nebraska]] in the [[United States]]. The population was 1,029 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].  Loup City is close to the [[Loup River|Middle Loup River]], and about five miles from [[Sherman Dam (Nebraska)|Sherman Reservoir]].

==Overview==
Loup City was the first permanent settlement in Sherman County which was named for Civil War General William Tecumseh Sherman. In 1871, Martin, William, and Cyrus Benschoter and William Walt stayed a short time in the area and were so favorably impressed with the beauty of the Loup Valley and the good earth that they spread word to friends and relatives that they had found the &quot;garden spot of the world.&quot;

The first school district was formed in 1873 with J. Wesley Eddy serving as superintendent. Eddy was also the minister who performed marriages and church services in the area.

The years between 1873 and 1878 were difficult years for the settlers. Reports of an impending Indian uprising and destruction of crops by grasshoppers scared many settlers into leaving. In 1875 conditions improved, and in 1876 the town began to prosper due to the increased travel to the Black Hills.

In 1878, the number of settlers increased and in 1886, the Union Pacific Railroad laid tracks to Loup City. In 1887 the railroad, known today as the Burlington Northern, reached Loup City with its tracks.

During the Great Depression, Loup City was the site of a clash between radical [[leftists]], influenced by [[Ella Reeve Bloor|Mother Bloor]], who clashed with area residents in June 1934 following efforts by Communists to organize the workers of a poultry processing plant.

The completion of Sherman Reservoir in 1963 added tourism to the area's economic base.

For many years Loup City has proclaimed itself as the &quot;Polish capital of Nebraska,&quot; due to a significant Polish population (see [[Polish diaspora|Polonia]]). &quot;Polish Days&quot; is an annual community event held on the first weekend of June. The town's Catholic church, [[Saint Josaphat]]'s, features stained glass windows commemorating area families, most with Polish names. The windows were salvaged from the previous St. Josaphat's and date from the early 1900s.&lt;ref name =&quot;Our Community&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Community|url=http://loupcity.org/our_community.htm|publisher={{URL|1=http://www.nppd.com/}}|accessdate=2012-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recreation==
[[Sherman Dam]] - 2,845-acre lake and 4,721 land acres. Primitive camping includes 360 non-pad sites. Facilities include picnic tables, shelters, water, dumpstation, modern restrooms, vault toilets, four boat ramps, fish cleaning stations, coin-operated showers and concession. 

Bowman Recreation Area - Bowman Lake, located one mile west of Loup City, is a 23-acre area lying adjacent to the Loup River and features a 20-acre man made lake.  It offers picnicking, fishing and primitive camping. 

Jenners Park - At one time, Jenner’s Park was home to amusement rides and a zoo. Today, the park is home to a disc golf course, two picnic shelters, outdoor grills, playground equipment, and an outdoor recreation area. 

Loup City Swimming Pool - Newly built in 2000, the Loup City pool has a water slide, diving board, basketball hoop, mushroom, and zero depth entry.

Loup City Golf Course - A 9 hole course located one mile west of Loup City.  The par 36 course has mature trees, a creek, and several ponds.

Petersen Park Ball Fields - Two newly developed baseball fields used for T-ball teams to high school softball teams. The park also includes a playground area for younger children.

'''Gering''' is a city in [[Scotts Bluff County, Nebraska|Scotts Bluff County]], [[Nebraska]], [[United States]]. It is part of the [[Scottsbluff, Nebraska]] [[Scottsbluff micropolitan area|Micropolitan Statistical Area]]. The population was 8,500 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. It is the [[county seat]] of [[Scotts Bluff County, Nebraska|Scotts Bluff County]]{{GR|6}}.

Gering was founded in 1887 at the base of the bluff that is now the center of [[Scotts Bluff National Monument]]. The city of [[Scottsbluff, Nebraska|Scottsbluff]] was founded across the North [[Platte River]] from the bluff in 1900. Separated only by the river, the two cities have since grown together and now form the 7th largest urban area in Nebraska.

==Major events==
In 1922, Gering started its annual Oregon Trail Days, a celebration that takes place during the second week of July each year. Friends, families, [[Gering High School]] classmates, and the Old Settlers reunion all congregate in Gering for a weekend full of activities.

The Oregon Trail Days weekend kicks off with the community barbecue on Thursday night.

'''Indianola''' is a city in [[Red Willow County, Nebraska|Red Willow County]], [[Nebraska]], [[United States]]. The population was 584 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. On 27 March 2004, a fire that started in the town's only grocery store destroyed the store and the city offices.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

In its early days, Indianola was the county seat of Red Willow County.  After the railroad opted to locate its midpoint terminal on the Omaha to Denver route in McCook rather than in Indianola (McCook offered free land for the rail yard whereas a private citizen in Indianola requested a large sum for his land thinking it was a done deal), population shifted to McCook and after several attempts, some violent, the county offices were moved to McCook.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Located in the City Park of Indianola is the grave of a [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]] woman who died of wounds received at the battle between the Sioux and Pawnee tribes at [[Massacre Canyon]] just east of Trenton, Nebraska.  Originally she was buried northwest of town on a bluff overlooking Coon Creek. In the 1970s, it became obvious that erosion would eventually destroy her gravesite, and in 1975 she was reburied in the park, with representatives of the Pawnee tribe participating in the ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nebraskahistory.org/publish/markers/texts/pawnee_womans_grave.htm &quot;Pawnee Woman's Grave&quot;.]  [http://www.nebraskahistory.org/index.htm Nebraska State Historical Society.]  Retrieved 2010-09-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peru''' is a city in [[Nemaha County, Nebraska|Nemaha County]], [[Nebraska]], [[United States]]. The population was 865 at the [[United States Census, 2010|2010 census]].  [[Peru State College]] is located in Peru.

==History==
The first attempt to settle the community occurred in 1853 when some residents of [[Peru, Illinois]].  However troops from [[Fort Kearney]] forced them to leave because [[Nebraska Territory]] was still occupied by the [[Otoe (tribe)]].  They then temporarily settled across the [[Missouri River]] at Sonora (now [[Watson, Missouri]]).  In 1857 a community formed around a trading post called Mount Vernon on the bluffs above the river on the Nebraska side.&lt;ref name=casde&gt;http://www.casde.unl.edu/history/counties/nemaha/peru/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1857 settlers founded Peru down the hill from Mount Vernon directly on the [[Missouri River]].  In 1861 a [[Methodist]] school called Mount Vernon Academy opened.  In 1867 the school (which became [[Peru State College]]) became the state's first [[normal school]].&lt;ref name=casde/&gt;

Floods in the 1860s changed the course of the river pushing it nearly a mile from Peru.  An 1867 flood caused the Nebraska community of [[McKissick Island]] northeast of Peru to be surrounded by Missouri land and cause a border dispute that would not be resolved until 1999.

'''Valentine''' is a city in [[Cherry County, Nebraska|Cherry County]], [[Nebraska]], [[United States]]. The population was 2,737 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. It is the [[county seat]] of [[Cherry County, Nebraska|Cherry County]].{{GR|6}}

In 2007, ''[[National Geographic Adventure Magazine|National Geographic Adventure]]'' magazine included Valentine in its list of the best ten wilderness towns and cities.&lt;ref name=nga&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adventure.nationalgeographic.com/weekend-getaways/nebraska/valentine-travel|work=National Geographic Adventure|accessdate=24 January 2011|title=Best Adventure Towns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Valentine is named for [[Edward K. Valentine]], who as a congressman from Nebraska, was the chairman of the [[United States House of Representatives|House]] Committee on Agriculture during his six years in office (1879–1885). He was instrumental in getting local settlers' grievances redressed by the [[Government of the United States|federal government]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heartcity.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=28&amp;Itemid=63 E.K.Valentine] Valentine municipal website, 2007.  Accessed 11 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Valentine was nearly destroyed two years in a row: a large storm with extremely high winds caused extensive damage to trees and buildings in July 2005, and in July 2006 the &quot;Big Rock Fire&quot; engulfed over {{convert|3000|acre|km2}} of land.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Valentine participates in an annual re-mailing program where thousands of pieces of mail flow into the local [[United States Post Office]] so that they can be re-mailed with a special Valentine's Day postmark and verse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heartcity.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=30&amp;Itemid=69 Valentine Cachet] Valentine municipal website, 2007.

==Geography==
Valentine is located at {{Coord|42|52|25|N|100|33|1|W|type:city}} (42.873686, &amp;minus;100.550308){{GR|1}}. According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|2.25|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which, {{convert|2.22|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.03|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.&lt;ref name =&quot;Gazetteer files&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Valentine is immediately north of the [[Niobrara River]], on the northern edge of the [[Sandhills (Nebraska)|Sandhills]] physiographic region. [[Merritt Reservoir]], created by a dam on the [[Snake River (Nebraska)|Snake River]], is located about {{convert|48|km|mi|abbr=on}} southwest of Valentine. [[Snake River Falls (Nebraska)|Snake River Falls]], the largest waterfall in Nebraska, is located on the Snake River between the reservoir (a few miles downstream) and Valentine. Smith Falls, the tallest waterfall in Nebraska, is located on a small stream tributary to the Niobrara River about {{convert|15|mi|km}} east of Valentine in [[Smith Falls State Park]].

Just south of Valentine, a pair of bridges span the Niobrara River. The modern bridge carries traffic north and south along [[U.S. Route 83]]. Just to the west, an arched [[cantilever bridge|cantilever truss bridge]] named the Bryan Bridge is also open to through traffic. Designed by Josef Sorkin and built in 1932, the Bryan Bridge is made of steel and is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nebraskahistory.org/publish/markers/texts/bryan_bridge.htm Bryan Bridge description] nebraskahistory.org. Retrieved on 03-16-2009.&lt;/ref&gt; A large red [[neon]] heart (a star during the Christmas season) is found on the pine-covered Minnechaduza Creek canyon wall at the north end of Main Street.

==History==

===Pre-settlement===
In the 18th century, the area around the confluence of the Platte and the Loup Rivers was used by a variety of Native American tribes, including [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]], [[Otoe tribe|Otoe]], [[Ponca]], and [[Omaha (tribe)|Omaha]].&lt;ref&gt;Olson, James C. and Ronald C. Naugle.  ''History of Nebraska''.  University of Nebraska Press.  1997.  p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;  
The Pawnee are thought to have descended from the Protohistoric Lower Loup Culture;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nebraskastudies.org/0300/frameset_reset.html?http://www.nebraskastudies.org/0300/stories/0301_0101.html &quot;Emergence of Historic Tribes: The Lower Loup Culture&quot;.]  NebraskaStudies.Org.  Retrieved 2010-01-09.&lt;/ref&gt; 
the Otoe had moved from central Iowa into the lower Platte Valley in the early 18th century;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nebraskastudies.org/0300/frameset_reset.html?http://www.nebraskastudies.org/0300/stories/0301_0105.html &quot;Emergence of Historic Tribes: The Oto &amp; Missouria Tribes&quot;.]  NebraskaStudies.Org.  Retrieved 2009-01-09.&lt;/ref&gt; 
and the closely related Omaha and Ponca had moved from the vicinity of the Ohio River mouth, settling along the Missouri by the mid-18th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nebraskastudies.org/0300/frameset_reset.html?http://www.nebraskastudies.org/0300/stories/0301_0104.html &quot;Emergence of Historic Tribes: The Omaha &amp; Ponca Tribes&quot;.]  NebraskaStudies.Org.  Retrieved 2009-01-09.&lt;/ref&gt;  
In 1720, Pawnee and Otoe allied with the French massacred the Spanish force led by [[Villasur expedition|Pedro de Villasur]] just south of the present site of Columbus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nebraskahistory.org/publish/markers/texts/villasur_expedition_1720.htm &quot;The Villasur Expedition&amp;mdash;1720&quot;.]  Nebraska State Historical Society.  Retrieved 2010-01-09.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nebraskastudies.org/0300/frameset_reset.html?http://www.nebraskastudies.org/0300/stories/0301_0113.html &quot;Villasur Sent to Nebraska&quot;.]  NebraskaStudies.Org.  Retrieved 2010-01-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, the &quot;[[Great Platte River Road]]&quot;&amp;mdash;the valley of the Platte and North Platte rivers running from [[Fort Kearny]] to [[Fort Laramie]]&amp;mdash; was the principal route of the westward expansion.&lt;ref&gt;Mattes, Merrill J. (1969).  ''The Great Platte River Road''.  Nebraska State Historical Society.  p 6.&lt;/ref&gt;
For travellers following the north bank of the Platte, the Loup River, with its soft banks and quicksands, represented a major obstacle.  In the absence of a ferry or a bridge, most of these followed the Loup for a considerable distance upstream before attempting a crossing: the first major wave of Mormon emigrants, for instance, continued up that river to a point about three miles downstream from present-day [[Fullerton, Nebraska|Fullerton]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mattes 1969, p. 132&quot;&gt;Mattes (1969), p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Settlement and early history===
The site of Columbus was settled by the Columbus Town Company on May 28, 1856.  The group took its name from [[Columbus, Ohio]], where most of the settlers had originally lived.  The townsite was selected for its location on the proposed route of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad|transcontinental railroad]].&lt;ref name=evans&gt;Evans, Marion Reeder (1936).  &quot;80 Years of Progress&quot;.  ''Columbus 1856-1936''.  The Art Printery.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5}}

Just west of the Columbus site, the Elk Horn and Loup Fork Bridge and Ferry Company, headed by James C. Mitchell, had laid out the townsite of Pawnee.  In 1855, Mitchell had obtained from the [[First Nebraska Territorial Legislature]] the right to operate a ferry across the Loup River.  The two companies consolidated in November 1856.&lt;ref name=curry /&gt;{{rp|27–28}}

At the time of its initial settling, the land Columbus occupied still belonged to the [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]].  However, in 1857, the Pawnee signed a treaty whereunder they gave up the bulk of their Nebraska lands, save for a reservation on what is now [[Nance County, Nebraska]].&lt;ref name=hyde&gt;Hyde, George E. (1951).  ''Pawnee Indians''.  University of Denver Press.  p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1858, the Platte County Commissioners passed an act of incorporation making Columbus a town;&lt;ref name=andreas-part2&gt;[http://www.kancoll.org/books/andreas_ne/platte/platte-p2.html#organize Platte County, Part 2].  ''Andreas' History of the State of Nebraska''.  Retrieved 2009-12-13.&lt;/ref&gt; 
at this time there were 16 citizens.  It became the county seat shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name=evans /&gt;{{rp|5}}
In that same year, at the recommendation of the U.S. Army, a ferry across the Loup was installed;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mattes 1969, p. 132&quot;/&gt; contemporary documents suggest that the Mitchell company had failed to act on its right to operate such a ferry.&lt;ref name=curry /&gt;{{rp|30–31}}

===Railroads and growth===
Growth of the town was slow until 1863.  In that year, construction began in Omaha on the transcontinental railroad.  The [[Homestead Act]], passed the previous year, attracted a host of settlers to the Plains and gave rise to increased emigrant traffic business.  The ferry across the Loup was replaced by a seasonal pontoon bridge, used in the summer and taken up in the winter.&lt;ref name=evans /&gt;{{rp|5}}  
The railroad reached Columbus in June 1866, at which time the city's population was about 75.&lt;ref name=andreas-part2 /&gt;

[[File:Columbus, Nebraska RR depot from SE.JPG|thumb|Union Pacific depot in Columbus]]

The energetic and eccentric promoter [[George Francis Train]] envisioned building &quot;a magnificent highway of cities&quot; from coast to coast along the Union Pacific route; Columbus was to be one of these.&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, L.H., B.J. Cottrell, H.A. Dalstrom, and K.C. Dalstrom. (2007) ''Upstream Metropolis: An Urban Biography of Omaha and Council Bluffs.'' University of Nebraska Press. p 62.&lt;/ref&gt;  
In 1865, he bought several hundred lots in the city.  In the following year, seeing the nearby townsite of Cleveland as a threat to his plans for Columbus, he bought the only building on the site, a hotel, and moved it to Columbus.  He renamed the building the Credit Foncier Hotel, after his land company, [[Credit Foncier of America]];&lt;ref name=curry&gt;Curry, Margaret.  [http://www.usgennet.org/usa/ne/topic/resources/OLLibrary/Platte/index.htm ''History of Platte County''].  Culver City, California: Murry &amp; Gee, Inc., 1950.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|45}} 
in it, he set aside a room permanently reserved for the President of the United States.&lt;ref name=evans /&gt;{{rp|6}}  
Train believed that the capital of the United States should be in the geographic center of the nation,&lt;ref name=andreas-part2 /&gt; 
and promoted Columbus as &quot;...the new center of the Union and quite probably the future capital of the U.S.A.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;Howard, R.W. (1962) ''The Great Iron Trail: The Story of the First Transcontinental Railroad.'' Putnam. p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt;

Columbus grew and prospered during the 1870s, as a result of both expanding agriculture in Platte County and traffic on the railroad.  During the decade, the population of the county grew threefold, and Columbus became the trade center for an eight-county area.  The [[Black Hills Gold Rush]] in 1875 led the city's merchants to promote it as a staging and outfitting area for gold seekers, who could ride the railroad to Columbus and then travel overland to the gold fields.&lt;ref name=columbuscommercialreg /&gt;

In 1879, Columbus became the focus of a war between railroad companies.  The [[Burlington and Missouri River Railroad|Burlington and Missouri]] proposed to develop a line from [[Lincoln, Nebraska|Lincoln]] through Columbus and into northwestern Nebraska, and urged the citizens of Platte County to vote a bond of $100,000 for construction expenses.  [[Union Pacific Railroad|Union Pacific]] financier [[Jay Gould]], displeased at the prospect of competition, informed the voters of the county that if the measure passed, he would do his best to ruin Columbus.  After a heated campaign, the measure passed despite Gould's threats.  The Burlington and Missouri built a line from Lincoln to Columbus, but stopped there; for their diagonal route across Nebraska, they chose one that crossed the Union Pacific at [[Grand Island, Nebraska|Grand Island]] rather than Columbus.&lt;ref name=curry /&gt;{{rp|324}}

Gould sought to make good on his threat.  When the Union Pacific developed its subsidiary [[Omaha, Niobrara and Black Hills Railroad]], he directed that it cross the Loup River at Lost Creek, the site of present-day Oconee, then run south to join the Union Pacific's main line at Jackson (since renamed [[Duncan, Nebraska|Duncan]]), bypassing Columbus.  Fortunately for Columbus, an ice jam destroyed the Lost Creek bridge in the spring of 1881.  Railroad officials agreed to reroute the line down the north bank of the Loup to Columbus in exchange for a $25,000 contribution from the city.&lt;ref name=curry /&gt;{{rp|325}}

In 1911, the [[Meridian Highway]] project was launched with the formation of a Meridian Road association in Kansas.  Later in that same year, John Nicholson, originator of the highway, spoke at a meeting in Columbus, at which the Nebraska Meridian Road Association was organized.  The proposed north-south transcontinental highway crossed the Platte and the Loup rivers at the Columbus bridges.  In 1922, it was designated a state highway.  The completion of the [[Meridian Highway Bridge|Meridian Bridge]] in 1924, replacing a seasonal ferry across the [[Missouri River]] at the Nebraska-South Dakota border, made the highway a year-round route from Canada to Mexico.  In 1928, the route became [[U.S. Route 81|U.S. Highway 81]].&lt;ref name=meridianreg&gt;Slattery, Christina, Chad D. Moffett, and L. Robert Puschendorf (2001).

In 1913, the [[Lincoln Highway]] was established as an east-west transcontinental highway.  It followed the Platte River route across Nebraska; ultimately, about half of its mileage was on the Union Pacific right-of-way.&lt;ref name=lincolnhwyreg&gt;Puschendorf, L. Robert (2007).

It also crossed the Loup on the bridge at Columbus.&lt;ref name=columbusloupbridgereg&gt;Fraser, Clayton D. (1991).

Traffic on the two transcontinental auto routes through and near central Columbus spurred a burst of commercial construction.  Hotels were expanded and new ones built; service garages were opened.  To make the route through Columbus more attractive to motorists, the city undertook to illuminate and pave the downtown streets.  By 1925, all of the city's major commercial thoroughfares were paved, and almost every lot along 13th Street (the Lincoln Highway) between 23rd and 29th Avenues was occupied by a commercial building.&lt;ref name=columbuscommercialreg&gt;Kooiman, Barbara M. and Elizabeth A.

Rural Platte County suffered badly from the [[Great Depression]].  Grain and livestock prices had been high during [[World War I]], engendering a [[Economic bubble|bubble]] in farmland; to acquire additional acres, farmers had secured them with mortgages not only on the newly purchased land, but on their older holdings.  The fall in the prices of agricultural commodities, combined with drought-induced crop failures in 1934 and 1936, forced many such farmers to abandon their lands.&lt;ref name=olson&gt;Olson, Ralph Eugene (1937).

The civic and commercial leaders of Columbus aggressively sought federal and state funds for local construction projects during this time.  In 1931, the Meridian Viaduct was completed, carrying the combined Meridian and Lincoln highways across the Union Pacific tracks and eliminating a grade-level crossing.&lt;ref name=curry /&gt;{{rp|328}}  
In 1930&amp;ndash;31, the aging and inadequate bridge across the Platte was replaced; in 1932&amp;ndash;33, a new bridge was built at the Loup crossing.&lt;ref name=columbusloupbridgereg /&gt;

===Hydro power===
The most expensive and ambitious of Columbus's Depression-era public-works efforts was the construction of the [[Loup Canal|Loup Project]].  This was a {{convert|35|mi|adj=on}} canal running from a diversion weir on the Loup River in [[Nance County, Nebraska|Nance County]] to the Platte River about {{convert|1|mi}} below the mouth of the Loup.&lt;ref name=publicpower&gt;Firth, Robert E. (1962).  ''Public Power in Nebraska''.  Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|130–33}}
The waters of the canal run through two [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] generating stations: one north of [[Monroe, Nebraska|Monroe]] with a capacity of 7,800&amp;nbsp;kW; and one at Columbus with a capacity of 45,600&amp;nbsp;kW.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loup.com/aboutus/hydroelec.asp &quot;Hydroelectric system&quot;.]  [http://www.loup.com/ Loup Power District.]  Retrieved 2010-04-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Columbus hydroelectric plant (Nebraska) 2.jpg|thumb|left|Powerhouse with tailrace canal running out of base; electrical transformers on canal bank at right|Loup Canal hydroelectric plant and tailrace canal at Columbus]]

Initially financed with a loan and grant of $7.3 million from the [[Public Works Administration]],&lt;ref name=publicpower /&gt;{{rp|124}}
construction of the diversion structure, canal, and powerhouses began in August 1934&lt;ref name=lpdbook&gt;Farritor, Sharon (2006).  ''Power and Progress: The History of Loup Power District 1933-2006''.  Published by Loup Power District.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|78}}
and was finished, apart from some final details, in September 1938.&lt;ref name=publicpower /&gt;{{rp|129}}
At its peak, in October 1936, the project directly employed 1,352 people.&lt;ref name=olson /&gt;{{rp|222}}

To make payments on the Loup Project bonds, the Loup River Public Power District had to find a market for its electricity.  Rural electrification was not expanding rapidly; and private power companies in Nebraska were only willing to buy a small fraction of the project's power.  Although the provisions of the [[Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935]] gave East Coast holding companies an incentive to sell off their Nebraska subsidiaries, bankers were unwilling to finance their sale to the Loup District because of its debts from the canal project.&lt;ref name=publicpower /&gt;{{rp|139–40}}

In 1939, Consumers Public Power District was formed in Columbus.  The new organization's purpose was to buy power from the Loup Project and from the Tri-County and Sutherland projects on the Platte in central Nebraska; and to market it to consumers and municipal utilities.  To this end, it was authorized to issue revenue bonds for the purchase of privately held power companies.  By 1942, it had purchased all of the private electrical utilities in Nebraska outside of the immediate vicinity of Omaha;&lt;ref name=publicpower /&gt;{{rp|139–47}} 
by 1949, the last of the private utilities had been bought up, making Nebraska the only state in the nation to be served entirely by public power.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nebraskastudies.org/0800/frameset_reset.html?http://www.nebraskastudies.org/0800/stories/0801_0505.html &quot;The Tri-County Project: Public Power in Nebraska&quot;.]  [http://www.nebraskastudies.org/ NebraskaStudies.org.]  Retrieved 2010-04-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II and after===
With the arrival of [[World War II]], Columbus's boosters sought a war plant for Columbus.  They persuaded the federal government to purchase {{convert|90|acre}} in northeastern Columbus, and to build a railroad line to the site.  Before construction of the projected aluminum-extrusion plant could begin, however, it became clear that the war would end soon and that the plant would not be needed.&lt;ref name=sites&gt;[http://sites.nppd.com/aedc/FactsBook/Columbusbook.pdf &quot;Community Facts: Columbus, Nebraska&quot;.]  [http://sites.nppd.com/ Nebraska Public Power District.]  Retrieved 2010-04-15.&lt;/ref&gt;  
The site was sold as surplus property to the Loup District for a fraction of its original cost; the District turned it into an industrial site.&lt;ref name=publicpower /&gt;{{rp|137–38}}  
In 1946, [[Walter Behlen|Behlen Manufacturing]] built a factory on the site;&lt;ref name=curry /&gt;{{rp|389}}
the rest of the available land was occupied soon thereafter.&lt;ref name=publicpower /&gt;{{rp|138}}

'''Sidney''' is a city and [[county seat]] of [[Cheyenne County, Nebraska|Cheyenne County]], [[Nebraska]], [[United States]].{{GR|6}}  The population was 6,757 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].

==History==
The city was named for Sidney Dillon, a railroad attorney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epodunk.com/cgi-bin/genInfo.php?locIndex=27574|title=Profile for Sidney, Nebraska|publisher=[[ePodunk]]|accessdate=2010-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in 1867 by the [[Union Pacific]] and grew up around the military base of [[Fort Sidney]] (also known as Sidney Barracks), where soldiers were stationed to guard the [[transcontinental railroad]] from potential Indian attacks. 

The town became the southern terminus of the [[Sidney Black Hills Stage Road]] which used [[Clarke's Bridge]] (near [[Bridgeport, Nebraska]]) to allow military and civilian traffic to reach [[Fort Robinson]], [[Red Cloud Agency]], [[Spotted Tail Agency]], [[Custer, South Dakota]], and [[Deadwood, South Dakota]] in the late 1870s and 1880s.

Sidney is home to one of the [[American Frontier|Old West]]'s [[Boot Hill]] cemeteries; many of those interred there were soldiers from the fort.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sidneyboothill.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
Sidney is located at {{coord|41|8|22|N|102|58|42|W|type:city}} (41.139428, -102.978323){{GR|1}}.  According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|6.93|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, all of it land.&lt;ref name =&quot;Gazetteer files&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sidney is toward the western edge of the midwestern wheat-growing region. West of the city, the land is increasingly used for [[cattle ranching]]. Sidney is located along [[Lodgepole Creek]], which is along present-day [[Interstate 80]].

The city is presently located at the junction of [[US 385]] with I-80, and its location approximately halfway between [[Cheyenne, Wyoming]] and [[North Platte, Nebraska]] has encouraged the growth of the city as a major transportation service area on the Interstate Highway.  Because the I-80/US 385 interchange is located several miles southeast of the town center, a new commercial area has developed, including truck stops, convenience stores, the [[Cabela's]] world headquarters, shopping centers, motels, restaurants, and other commercial enterprises.  In recent years, the city has seen further growth with the construction of [[wind farm]]s in this portion of the [[Nebraska Panhandle]] and adjacent areas of [[Colorado]], including [[Peetz, Colorado]].

'''Blair''' is a city in and the [[county seat]] of [[Washington County, Nebraska|Washington County]], [[Nebraska]], [[United States]].{{GR|6}}  The population was 7,990 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].  Blair is a part of the [[Omaha-Council Bluffs metropolitan area|Omaha-Council Bluffs Metropolitan Statistical Area]].

==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2009}}
Blair, county seat and largest city in Washington County, was not one of its earliest towns. It was established after the [[American Civil War]], when the [[Sioux City and Pacific Rail Road]] chose to cross the river at that location, going from [[Missouri Valley, Iowa]], and up along &quot;Carter Hollow&quot; on the Nebraska side. Whether by chance or design, the route missed the existing river towns of DeSoto and Cuming City. An entirely new town was needed.

A {{convert|1075|acre|km2|sing=on}} tract of land was purchased and platted, with lots to be sold at auction on May 10, 1869. The entire tract was purchased by [[John I. Blair]], an official of the railroad, who announced his plans for the city and named it for himself. This gave him and the railroad more opportunity for profit from development than by connecting existing towns, where rights of way may have been more expensive to purchase.

Front Street quickly took shape. Many businesses and several churches were hauled overland from the former town sites to supplement those being built. In a short time, there were hardware, implement, and dry goods stores, a hotel, a bank, and a newspaper. A town board was formed in August.

Before the end of the year, the town called for an election to relocate the county seat, which at that time was in [[Fort Calhoun]]. Blair won, and a brick courthouse was erected at 19th and Grant.

Construction was also progressing on the rail line. Before a railroad bridge was built across the Missouri, freight cars were pushed onto barges on one side of the river, then pulled off on the other. Since the engines did not cross the river, a roundhouse to service them was built north of town. When the bridge was completed in 1882, that facility was dismantled and servicing was done in Iowa.

Local brickyards turned out 1,500,000 bricks per year to meet the demands of the city's rapid development. In 1884 the community, predominantly [[Danish people|Danish]] immigrants, raised $3,000 in matching funds and appropriated several acres of land on which to establish a &quot;folk school.&quot; The forerunner of Dana College, Trinity Seminary, was housed in a house until the four-story main building was dedicated in 1886.

By then, a city water system was in place, and South Creek, dug out by men with hand shovels, had been straightened to improve the drainage on south side of town. A public high school was constructed before the start of the 20th century.

Industries that sprang up along the railroad include: a mill which produced Maintop flour and livestock feeds; a foundry manufacturing roller bearings; a laboratory that made patent medicines; a poultry incubator plant employing about 40 men; and a horse collar company which employed up to 125 men, until &quot;horses left the drawbar scene.&quot;

A plant built in 1889 to provide electricity for lights, was not dependable or profitable. In 1914, a new municipal power plant was built, and later a city ice plant was added to supply Blair with &quot;safe ice,&quot; replacing the system of cutting it from the river.

Over the years, other enterprises came and went: a plant manufacturing spark plugs used in [[Ford Model T|Model T Fords]]; a canning company; a seed corn plant; and a church-publishing house. Kelly Ryan Equipment Company, established in the mid-1940s, employs up to 50 persons. The D.L.Blair Company, specializing in nation-wide promotion campaigns, was established in the 1970s.  Mid America Computer Corp. was also established in the 1970s and has a payroll of over 200 employees, serving more than 300 clients in the telecommunications industry.

The &quot;Bee-Line&quot; Highway, started in 1923, got little use until a bridge was built across the Missouri at Blair in 1929. Later designated as Highway 30, it was finally paved as a Federal Works project in the 1930s. Highways U.S. 75 and State 91 and 133 were completed later.

==Geography==
Blair is located at {{coord|41|32|44|N|96|8|4|W|type:city}} (41.545562, -96.134383){{GR|1}}.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|5.51|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which, {{convert|5.49|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.02|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.&lt;ref name =&quot;Gazetteer files&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blair has its own hospital, the Memorial Community Hospital, and being the county seat, also has a courthouse located in town.

'''Tilden''' is a city in [[Antelope County, Nebraska|Antelope]] and [[Madison County, Nebraska|Madison]] Counties in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Nebraska]]. Tilden was incorporated as Burnett in 1885, but the U.S. Post Office officially changed the name of the village in 1887, after presidential candidate [[Samuel J. Tilden]], due to confusion with [[Bennet, Nebraska]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ci.tilden.ne.us/ Welcome to Tilden, Nebraska&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The population was 953 at the [[United States Census, 2010|2010 census]]. The Madison County portion of Tilden is part of the [[Norfolk, Nebraska]] [[Norfolk Micropolitan Statistical Area|Micropolitan Statistical Area]].

Tilden is the birthplace of Scientology creator [[L. Ron Hubbard]] and baseball player and broadcaster [[Richie Ashburn]].

Tilden was located on the Cowboy Line of the [[Chicago and North Western Transportation Company|Chicago and Northwestern Railroad]].  The line was abandoned in 1992, and with it the antique [[wigwag (railroad)|wigwag]] signal that protected the main crossing in town.  The abandoned line has been converted to the [[Cowboy Trail]], running 321 miles from [[Norfolk, Nebraska|Norfolk]] to [[Chadron, Nebraska|Chadron]]; when complete, it will be the longest rails-to-trails line in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ngpc.state.ne.us/parks/guides/trails/cowboy/cowboy.asp &quot;The Cowboy Trail&quot;.]  [http://www.ngpc.state.ne.us/ Nebraska Game and Parks Commission.]  Retrieved 2010-02-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alliance''' is a city in [[Box Butte County, Nebraska|Box Butte County]], [[Nebraska]], [[United States]]. The population was 8,491 at the [[United States Census, 2010|2010 census]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rapidcityjournal.com/thechadronnews/news/article_0bfc2de8-943e-5790-a008-f492b9e21542.html,&lt;/ref&gt; It is the [[county seat]] of [[Box Butte County, Nebraska|Box Butte County]].{{GR|6}}

Alliance is the home to [[Carhenge]] (a replica of [[Stonehenge]] constructed with automobiles), which is located just north of the city.

==History==
The town was originally named '''Grand Lake'''. When the [[Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad]] came to Grand Lake in 1888, the railroad superintendent, G.W. Holdrege, wanted to change it to a simple one-word name closer to the beginning of the alphabet, which he thought would be better for business. The [[United States Postal Service|U.S. Post Office]] gave Holdrege permission, and he picked &quot;Alliance&quot; for the new name of the town.

The Alliance Army Airfield was established in 1942. Construction was completed in August 1943 and the Army Air Corps used the facility as a training base until the end of [[World War II]]. The facility was transferred from the federal government to the City of Alliance in 1953 and is currently in use as the [[Alliance Municipal Airport]].

==History==
Long Pine was a hub for the [[Chicago and North Western Transportation Company]] on what came to be known as the Cowboy Line and at one time held a large roundhouse, turntable, and servicing facility.  With the advent of diesel locomotives, the steam servicing facilities were no longer needed and were moved elsewhere.  Eventually, the entire line was abandoned and the last train came through the town in 1992.  The former right of way has since become a recreational trail known as the [[Cowboy Trail]].

==Cultural allusions==
* Long Pine is mentioned in [[Willa Cather]]'s 1911 short story ''[[The Joy of Nelly Deane]]''.

==Cultural references==
Beginning in February 1996, the city was denoted the location of the &quot;[[Cities that have been David Letterman's Home Office|home office]]&quot; that produces the top-10 list for [[David Letterman]]'s ''[[Late Show with David Letterman|Late Show]]'' program, having relocated from [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]]. The town had lobbied Letterman for the status for months. It had the Nebraska legislature proclaim him an [[Nebraska admiral|admiral in the Great Navy of the State of Nebraska]], as well as inundate Letterman with letters, postcards, and bribes of flowers, clothing, animals, alcoholic beverages, shredded money, and free checkups at the Wahoo Medical Center. When Letterman jokingly said he wanted more, Wahoo sent him a '76 [[Ford Pinto]] with a sofa attached to the hood, a wall clock made of cow droppings, and two of the town's teenagers, brothers Jeff and Josh Price. This brought some degree of fame and tourism to the town. The nightly recap of the show on the [[CBS]] web site is titled ''The Wahoo Gazette''.

Wahoo Public High School is the owner of the third-longest boys' high school basketball winning streak — 114 straight games — from 1987-88 through the 1991-92 seasons, winning four state championships.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

Wahoo was also the home of the now defunct [[John F. Kennedy College]].

'''West Point''' is a city in and the [[county seat]] of [[Cuming County, Nebraska|Cuming County]], [[Nebraska]], [[United States]].{{GR|6}} The population was 3,364 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].

==History==
West Point was first founded in the spring of 1857, when Omaha businessmen formed the Nebraska Settlement Association in order to find suitable townsites in the Elkhorn Valley.  Uriah, John, and Andrew Bruner (three brothers, originally from Pennsylvania), and William Sexauer chose the present location on a bend along a river, which they called New Philadelphia.  The name was soon changed to West Point because it was the westernmost outpost along the valley.

West Point became the county seat of Cuming County on October 12, 1858 after winning the election over the community of DeWitt.  A total of 19 votes were split between the two towns with West Point obtaining 12 votes.  By the spring of 1859, over 4,000 Pawnee natives flooded the Elkhorn Valley during a hunting excursion and, displeased to find white settlers in the valley, burned several homesteads and killed livestock.  The so-called Pawnee War ended near Battle Creek without a fight.

West Point grew slowly at first, but with the coming of the railroad in 1870, it boomed to a population of over 700.

West Point is located at {{coord|41|50|23|N|96|42|41|W|type:city}} (41.839635, -96.711406){{GR|1}}.

==History==
[[Meriwether Lewis]] and [[William Clark (explorer)|William Clark]] passed through the South Sioux City area in 1804.

European settlement on the [[Nebraska]] side of the river began as early as 1854. Several town sites were platted and incorporated in the 1850s.  '''Pacific City''', incorporated in 1858, was a short-lived settlement.  '''Covington''' and '''South Covington''', both incorporated in 1857, merged in 1870.  Another town, '''Stanton''', was founded in 1856.

South Sioux City was incorporated in 1887.&lt;ref name=&quot;South Sioux City Nebraska&quot;/&gt; A special election in 1893 approved the merger of Covington and Stanton into the city of South Sioux City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.casde.unl.edu/history/counties/dakota/southsiouxcity/ |title=South Sioux City -- Dakota County |author= |date= |work=Virtual Nebraska |publisher=Center for Advanced Land Management Information Technologies, University of Nebraska-Lincoln |accessdate=2011-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Infrastructure==

===Highways===
Several highways serve South Sioux City:
* [[Interstate 129]] is a short east-west spur beginning at [[Interstate 29]] in [[Sioux City, Iowa|Sioux City]]. It enters South Sioux City via a bridge over the [[Missouri River]], and crosses the southern end of South Sioux City with interchanges at Dakota Avenue (the city's main street) and [[U.S. Highway 77]]. Interstate 129 overlaps [[U.S. Highway 20]] and [[U.S. Highway 75]].

[[File:South Sioux City, Nebraska Veterans Bridge from DS 2.JPG|thumb|alt=Bridge on high concrete pillars; two pillars connected by double arch|Siouxland Veterans Memorial Bridge]]

* [[U.S. Highway 77]] is a north-south highway whose northern terminus is at [[Interstate 29]] in [[Sioux City, Iowa|Sioux City]]. From there, it enters South Sioux City via the [[Siouxland Veterans Memorial Bridge]], follows Dakota Avenue to 9th Street, then arcs west and south as a four-lane bypass around the city. In 1989, a large strip mall anchored by [[Wal-Mart]] and [[Hy-Vee]] opened along the bypass and effectively shifted the city's primary retail district from Dakota Avenue, in the center of town, to the western edge of the city.

===Public transit===
Local bus service to South Sioux City is provided by the Sioux City Transit System.

===Aviation===
The nearest commercial airport is [[Sioux Gateway Airport]]/Colonel Bud Day Field (SUX) in Sioux City. A smaller general-aviation airport, Martin Field (7K8), is located just west of South Sioux City along [[U.S. Highway 20]].

==History==
The [[Fremont, Elkhorn and Missouri Valley Railroad]] reached [[Fort Robinson]] in 1886 on its way to [[Wyoming]]. Several miles east of the Fort the railroad passed through a tree claim belonging to William Annin (also spelled &quot;Annon&quot;), who sold his claim for a new townsite. The &quot;tent city&quot; that sprang up was named after Lt. [[Emmet Crawford]], who had been formerly stationed at Fort Robinson but was killed in [[Mexico]] in January 1886.&lt;ref name=&quot;survey&quot;/&gt; The town's original plat was filed on June 21, 1886 by the Western Townsite Company. E.A. Thompson and William D. Edger (editor of the original ''[[Crawford Clipper]]'') circulated a petition for Crawford to become a village, but upon getting only 69 of the 200 needed signatures, secured the remaining signatures from willing soldiers at Fort Robinson.&lt;ref name=&quot;75th&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Crawford Diamond Jubilee Committee |year=1961 |title=Crawford, Nebraska 1886-1961 |publisher=Crawford Diamond Jubilee Committee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The soldiers kept the town supplied with much business during its early years because of their want for entertainment. Crawford was a very wild town, and was home to many [[Western saloon|saloons]] and [[brothel]]s. In fact, [[Calamity Jane]] came to Crawford from [[Deadwood, South Dakota]] with ten dancing girls and set up a tent south of town. There were also a number of murders that took place in Crawford, most involving soldiers from Fort Robinson.&lt;ref name=&quot;75th&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lee&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Wild Towns of Nebraska |last=Lee |first=Wayne C. |year=1988 |publisher=The CAXTON PRINTERS, Ltd. |location=Caldwell, Idaho |isbn=0870043250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Downtown Crawford, Nebraska Postcard c. 1910.jpg|left|thumb|185px|C. 1910 depiction of Second Street (Crawford's main business thoroughfare) from Main Street.]] A second railroad, the [[Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad|Chicago, Burlington and Quincy]], reached Crawford in 1887, providing an additional boost to the community. In 1907 Crawford became a city, and by 1911 Crawford had the seventh-most business volume in Nebraska. Through the years Crawford saw many businesses come and go, including a brick works, mica mill, pickle factory, and a [[Nash Finch Company]] warehouse. Crawford also lobbied for a state normal school, but the school (now [[Chadron State College]]) was established in nearby Chadron due to Crawford's proximity to [[Fort Robinson]].&lt;ref name=&quot;survey&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;75th&quot;/&gt;  Perhaps the most fascinating Crawford business was the Elite Theater, which was established circa 1910 in a converted saloon. The theater was owned and operated by Mrs. Georgianna Higgins,  thought to be the first woman theater owner in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=&quot;County 100th&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Dawes County Nebraska: The First 100 Years |last=Pinney |first=Patricia M. |year=1985 |publisher=Curtis Media Corporation |location=Dallas, Texas |isbn=978-1-881070-35-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;who's who&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Who's Who in Nebraska |author=Nebraska Press Association |year=1940 |publisher=Nebraska Press Association |location=Lincoln, Nebraska |page=240 |url=http://www.usgennet.org/usa/ne/topic/resources/OLLibrary/who1940/co/dawes2.htm |accessdate=15 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crawford's population peaked at 2,536 in 1910, largely because of the [[Kinkaid Act]]. However, the population dropped to 1,646 by 1920. The town began slowly growing, however, and the population was 1,845 in 1940. The population has been steadily decreasing since.&lt;ref name=&quot;survey&quot;/&gt;

'''Chadron''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ʃ|æ|d|r|ə|n}} {{respell|SHAD|rən}}) is a city in [[Dawes County, Nebraska|Dawes County]], [[Nebraska]], [[United States]]. The population was 5,851 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rapidcityjournal.com/thechadronnews/news/article_0bfc2de8-943e-5790-a008-f492b9e21542.html&lt;/ref&gt; It is the [[county seat]] of [[Dawes County, Nebraska|Dawes County]]{{GR|6}}. Chadron is the home of [[Chadron State College]].

Chadron also is the [[United States Forest Service]] headquarters of the [[Nebraska National Forest|Nebraska]] and [[Samuel R. McKelvie National Forest|Samuel R. McKelvie]] [[United States National Forest|National Forests]], and the [[Buffalo Gap National Grassland|Buffalo Gap]], [[Fort Pierre National Grassland|Fort Pierre]], and [[Oglala National Grassland|Oglala]] [[United States National Grassland|National Grasslands]]. The Museum of the Fur Trade is located near Chadron, at the site of the [[American Fur Company]]'s former Bordeaux Trading Post.

Chadron is located near the [[Pine Ridge Indian Reservation]] of the [[Oglala Lakota]] in South Dakota, and its businesses serve many of the reservation's residents.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}
&lt;!-- This is awkwardly phrased.  I suspect that it's intended to mean something like &quot;Chadron is where much of the retail spending by reservation residents is done, since there's little retail on the reservation itself&quot;.  However, without a source I can't presume to insert it. --&gt;

==History==
Succeeding cultures of indigenous peoples lived in the area for thousands of years.  In historic times, tribes such as the [[Oglala Lakota]] (Oglala Sioux Tribe), [[Cheyenne]] and others lived in the area. The Sioux used this territory as a hunting ground after pushing other tribes to the west.

Chadron is named for Louis Chartran, a French-Indian ([[Métis]]) fur trapper who ran a [[trading post]] on Bordeaux Creek in 1841.  He was married to an American Indian woman.&lt;ref name=&quot;COC&quot;/&gt;

In 1884 the town was formally established when the [[Fremont, Elkhorn, and Missouri Valley Railroad]] was constructed through the area from [[Omaha, Nebraska]] en route to Wyoming. Chadron was first named O'Linn for its founder Fannie O'Linn, who built a community at the confluence of the [[White River (Nebraska)]] and Chadron Creek.  This is where the railroad was expected to branch.  When it was built six miles away on Bordeaux Creek, the townspeople packed up the entire town—buildings included—and moved it to the new location.&lt;ref name=&quot;COC&quot;&gt;[http://208.106.208.95/history/chadronhistory.php &quot;Chadron history&quot;], Chadron Chamber of Commerce, retrieved December 24, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the founders of the town were the businessman [[Charles Henry King]] and his wife Martha.  King established retail and freight businesses and banks in towns along the railroad's route; he capitalized on the flow of settlers and pioneers to the region.  Four of the five King children were born in Chadron, including their second son [[Leslie Lynch King, Sr.|Leslie Lynch King]].  In 1908 the family moved to [[Omaha]], the business center of the state.  In 1912 Leslie married, and in July 1913 became the father of the future president, [[Gerald Ford]]. King and his wife divorced soon after that.

During the [[1893 Chicago World's Fair]], Chadron was the starting point of the 1,000-mile &quot;Chadron-Chicago Cowboy Horse Race.&quot;  Nine riders competed for the $1,000 prize to be the first to reach the entrance of [[Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show]].  Among the riders was the former outlaw [[Doc Middleton]].  John Berry won the race in 13 days and 16 hours.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=tCrgpwHv7wEC&amp;pg=PA320&amp;lpg=PA320&amp;dq=chadron+to+chicago+horse+race&amp;source=web&amp;ots=gPMlDZgWxJ&amp;sig=9WoMpFDbm9_bNrtUvqpkhyy_hs4#PPA320,M1 ''Nebraska: A Guide to the Cornhusker State'', by Federal Writers' Project], 1939, Works Progress Administration; reprinted 1979 - University of Nebraska Press, ISBN 0-8032-6851-3&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chadron State College]] was founded in 1911.

Current businesses include a [[Wal-Mart]], which serves residents from the [[Pine Ridge Indian Reservation]] to the north across the South Dakota border, as well as regional Nebraska residents.  Nebraska State Senator LeRoy J. Louden noted, &quot;That store was built because of the reservation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://100r.org/2012/02/gold-mines-in-hell/ Stephanie Woodward, &quot;Gold Mines in Hell&quot;], 100Reporters, February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nebraska City''' is a city and [[county seat]] of [[Otoe County, Nebraska|Otoe County]], [[Nebraska]], [[United States]].{{GR|6}}  As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the city population was 7,289.&lt;ref name=&quot;Census2010&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=2010 City Population and Housing Occupancy Status|url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=DEC_10_PL_GCTPL2.ST13&amp;prodType=table|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=September 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Nebraska State Legislature]] has credited Nebraska City as being the oldest incorporated city in the state, as it was the first approved by a special act of the [[Nebraska Territorial Legislature]] in 1855.&lt;ref&gt;(1912) ''Bulletin.'' Issues 2. Nebraska State Legislature. p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NC-City Council&quot;/&gt;

Nebraska City is home of [[Arbor Day]], the [[Missouri River]] Basin [[Lewis and Clark]] Center (which focuses on the [[natural history]] achievements of the expedition), and the [[Mayhew Cabin]], the only site in the state recognized by the [[National Park Service]] as a station on the [[Underground Railroad]]. 

==History==
{{refimprove|section|date=February 2010}}
Early European-American official exploration was reported in 1804 by [[Lewis and Clark]] as they journeyed west along the [[Missouri River]]. They encountered many of the historic [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribes whose ancestors had inhabited the territory for thousands of years.

During the years of early pioneer settlement, in 1846 the US Army built [[Fort Kearny|Old Fort Kearny]] at Nebraska City.  Several years later, the army abandoned it to relocate the fort to   central Nebraska, now south of present-day [[Kearney, Nebraska|Kearney]].

Shortly after the post was vacated, John Boulware developed an important river-crossing and ferry service from [[Iowa]] to present-day Nebraska City. He and his father expanded their business and in 1852 or 1853 built a ferry house, the first residence in Nebraska City.
                                                                                       
In 1854 the [[Kansas-Nebraska Act]] allowed legal settlement in the regional area. Three townships were incorporated by settlers including [[Stephen Nuckolls]], one of the fathers of Nebraska City. Nebraska City and Kearney City were incorporated in 1855, and South Nebraska City was incorporated in 1856. During those years, Nebraska City competed fiercely to become the [[Nebraska Territory]] capital. On December 31, 1857, these three town sites along with Prairie City joined, incorporating as present-day Nebraska City. Before the [[American Civil War]], Nebraska City was [[History of slavery in Nebraska|noted]] as having the Territory's largest population of slaves. Many worked on the riverfront as laborers, involved with moving freight and luggage associated with steamboat traffic.

By the mid-19th century, [[steamboats]] on the Missouri River were the vitalizing force behind Nebraska City’s growth - bringing commerce, people and freight to the west. In the spring of 1858 [[Russell, Majors and Waddell]] started freighting from Nebraska City on a government contract to transport all provisions for all western forts. The supplies were brought up the Missouri River by steamboat and then taken out by wagon train. Nebraska City's favorable position (with a gradual slope from the river to the table land above) and good trail made it an important link to the west. 

Since that beginning, the city became established as a regional transportation, economic, and agriculture hub for the three state area. Additional forms of transportation were important, including the [[steam wagon]] and the first [[locomotive engine]] of the [[Midland Pacific Railway|Midland Pacific]]. 

[[Image:JSMorton-1858.jpg|thumb|J. Sterling Morton, ca. 1858]]

[[J. Sterling Morton]] came to Nebraska City in 1855 to edit the ''[[Nebraska City News-Press|Nebraska City News]]''. Originally from [[Michigan]], he and his wife Caroline were lovers of nature. Morton served as [[Secretary of Agriculture]] under President [[Grover Cleveland]]’s administration and in 1872 he was instrumental in establishing the annual tree planting day, [[Arbor Day]]. Governor [[Robert Furnas]] of Nebraska issued the first Arbor Day Proclamation on March 31, 1874. The holiday is celebrated around the world.

Nebraska City has its own hospital, St Marys Hospital. As the county seat, it has the [[Otoe County Courthouse|courthouse and associated county offices]].

==History==
Gothenburg, Nebraska is named after [[Gothenburg]], [[Sweden]] and is noted for its Swedish heritage. Gothenburg, Nebraska, and Gothenburg ({{lang-sv|Göteborg}}), Sweden, are believed to be the only two cities named Gothenburg in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.scandinavianleadership.com/brand.html/brand-library/olof-bergstrom |title=Olof Bergstrom |accessdate=2011-01-27 |author= Scandinavian Leadership}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gothenburg was founded in 1882 by Olof Bergstrom, a native of [[Hassela]], in [[Gävleborg County]],  [[Sweden]].    After coming to America from Sweden in 1881, Bergstrom worked for a time on the [[Union Pacific Railroad]], then homesteaded in Dawson County near Gothenburg. He eventually became a land agent for the UP.  Bergstrom selected the site that was to become Gothenburg and located a farmstead about a mile north. The Union Pacific Railroad laid out the original town of eight blocks parallel to the railroad tracks.  Bergstrom made several return trips to Sweden to lead groups of settlers to Dawson County.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nebraskahistory.org/publish/publicat/timeline/bergstrom_olof.htm ''Olof Bergstrom'' (Nebraska State Historical Society)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fremont''' is a city in and the [[county seat]] of [[Dodge County, Nebraska|Dodge County]], [[Nebraska]], [[United States]],{{GR|6}} near [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]] in the eastern part of the state. The population was 26,397 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].

==History==
From the 1830s to the 1860s, the area saw a great deal of traffic due to the [[Mormon Trail]], which passed along the north bank of the [[Platte River]]. A ferry connected the two banks of the [[Elkhorn River]] near Fremont.  It was a major overland route for emigrant [[settlers]] going to the West, the military and hunters.

Fremont was founded in 1856, and was named after the American explorer, politician and military official General [[John C. Frémont]]. A colorful description of the early history of Fremont can be found in [http://www.usgennet.org/usa/ne/county/dodge/fremonthist.htm this article].

Due to the town's geographically central location, the [[First Transcontinental Telegraph]] line (1861), [[First Transcontinental Railroad (North America)|railroad]] (1866) and highway (1913) passed through or very near Fremont. Original brick portions of the &quot;[[Lincoln Highway|Old Lincoln Highway]]&quot; located east of Fremont, on the way to [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]].

On January 10, 1976, in downtown Fremont, the Pathfinder Hotel exploded due to a [[natural gas]] leak in the basement. At the time the hotel was being used as apartments, mostly occupied by senior citizens. It also was a meeting place for philanthropic and business organizations, and had a drug store on the northwest corner. The [[explosion]] shattered windows around the city, and the ensuing fire killed 23 people and destroyed most of the city block of the hotel.

Fremont gained national attention in 2010 when residents approved a referendum that would ban [[illegal immigration|illegal immigrants]] from renting and working in the town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Davey|first=Monica|title=Nebraska Town Votes to Banish Illegal Immigrants|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/22/us/22fremont.html|accessdate=2010-06-22|newspaper=The New York Times|date=2010-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author=Dwyer Arce|url=http://jurist.org/paperchase/2010/06/nebraska-city-voters-pass-ban-on-hiring-renting-to-illegal-immigrants.php

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 20, 2011 at around 8&amp;nbsp;pm local time, a large squall line of storms entered the Fremont area and dropped an EF1 tornado east of downtown causing a damage path {{convert|6|mi|km}} long and 700 yards wide. There were no reported injuries or fatalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Brian|title=June 20, 2011 Fremont Tornado|url=http://www.crh.noaa.gov/news/display_cmsstory.php?wfo=oax&amp;storyid=69927&amp;source=0|work=Website|publisher=National Weather Service|accessdate=June 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recreation==
Fremont has 21 city-owned parks, with a combined area of over {{convert|400|acre|km2}}. Located in the northwest corner of Fremont near the &quot;Washington Heights&quot; neighborhood is the Fremont Golf Club (FGC). The FGC was completed in 1930 and features {{convert|6390|yd}} of golf from the longest tees for a par of 71.

In 2007 construction of the &quot;Splash Station&quot; water park was completed. The park cost an estimated $5.1&amp;nbsp;million and features an interactive train slide, combination lap pool and wave pool, body slide and speed slide.

==Geography and climate==
Fremont is located in the northeastern portion of Nebraska, at {{Coord|41|26|23|N|96|29|24|W|}}{{GR|1}}, along the [[Platte River]],  Fremont is approximately {{convert|35|mi|km}} northwest of the largest city in the area, [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]], and {{convert|50|mi|km}} northeast of the state capitol, [[Lincoln, Nebraska|Lincoln]].

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|8.85|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which, {{convert|8.80|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.05|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.&lt;ref name =&quot;Gazetteer files&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fremont is quite flat, lying in the river plain between the Platte and Elkhorn rivers, at an elevation of approximately 366 meters (1,203&amp;nbsp;ft) above sea level.

Fremont has its own hospital, the Fremont Area Medical Center. As the county seat, it is the location of the county courthouse.

Hooper is noted for a {{convert|24|ft|adj=on}} tower, with the town's name in {{convert|18|in|adj=on}} letters, completed in 2010 as a road sign for the town.  The tower was constructed alongside a new bypass on [[U.S. Route 275]] that diverted the highway around the town and raised concerns that the town would be unnoticed by passing traffic.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Barry, [http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/08/us/08land.html &quot;With a Sign, a Small Town Reclaims Its Identity&quot;], ''[[The New York Times]]'', December 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The site of North Bend was settled in 1856 by a party of Scottish immigrants.  En route from [[Lake Zurich, Illinois]] to [[Kansas]],&lt;ref name=casde&gt;Freeman, Kate.  [http://casde.unl.edu/history/counties/dodge/northbend/ &quot;North Bend&amp;mdash;Dodge County&quot;.]  [http://casde.unl.edu/history/about/index.php ''Nebraska...Our Towns''.]  Retrieved 2010-06-21.&lt;/ref&gt; they stopped at a bend at the northernmost point of the Platte River,&lt;ref name=libresearch&gt;[http://www.nebraskahistory.org/lib-arch/research/public/municipal_finding_aids/north_bend_ne.pdf &quot;North Bend, Dodge, Nebraska&quot;.]  [http://www.nebraskahistory.org/ Nebraska State Historical Society.]  Retrieved 2010-06-21.&lt;/ref&gt; where they were invited to an impromptu Fourth of July celebration at a newly founded townsite named Emerson.
Finding the site congenial, and concerned about the [[Bleeding Kansas|&quot;Border War&quot;]] in Kansas,&lt;ref name=casde /&gt; they opted to remain there, founding a nearby townsite that they named Franklin.&lt;ref name=libresearch /&gt;

The site grew with the arrival of new parties of settlers.  One such party brought a steam-powered sawmill and meal-grinder,&lt;ref name=casde /&gt; the first steam mill in Dodge County.&lt;ref name=perkey&gt;Perkey, Elton A (1995).  ''Perkey's Nebraska Place Names''.  Nebraska State Historical Society.  p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1858, Emerson's name was changed to Wallace, after a Philadelphia philanthropist who had offered to build a library in any town taking his name.&lt;ref name=casde /&gt;

The combined townsite arrived at its present name in 1864, when the Union Pacific Railroad bought a piece of ground for a depot on the proposed [[First Transcontinental Railroad|transcontinental railroad]].  For many years, surveys had showed the town's location as &quot;the north bend&quot;,&lt;ref name=histbldgs /&gt; and residents and Union Pacific officials agreed on that name for the town.&lt;ref name=libresearch /&gt;

The first train arrived in North Bend in 1866, and the town was platted by the railroad in 1867.&lt;ref name=histbldgs /&gt;  By 1876, the population had reached 250; there were 21 businesses, a school, and two churches.  The city's first newspaper, the ''Independent'', was founded in 1879.&lt;ref name=casde /&gt;

Growth continued steadily.  In 1890, the population reached 897; a city building was constructed.  By 1920, North Bend had electricity, a waterworks, and paved streets; the population was 1,087.  The town continued to grow through much of the 20th century, with its population reaching a peak of 1,368 in 1980.&lt;ref name=histbldgs /&gt;

'''Ralston''' is a city in [[Douglas County, Nebraska|Douglas County]], [[Nebraska]], [[United States]]. The population was 5,943 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. Ralston is surrounded on three sides by [[Omaha, Nebraska]] but is a separate city.

Since Ralston's population is below 10,000, state law technically allows for Omaha to forcibly annex Ralston (as they did with [[Elkhorn, Nebraska|Elkhorn]], another nearby city, in 2007, and had previously done with [[Millard, Nebraska|Millard]]). Omaha officials have never expressed a desire to annex Ralston; an agreement had been signed with Ralston's then-mayor, Wendell Kronberg, in the late 1960s whereby Omaha would leave Ralston alone.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

==Geography==
Ralston is located at {{coord|41|12|8|N|96|2|14|W|type:city}} (41.202198, -96.037168).{{GR|1}}

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|1.65|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which, {{convert|1.64|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.01|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.&lt;ref name =&quot;Gazetteer files&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nearest hospital is Bergan Mercy Hospital (3.7 miles) located in [[Omaha, Nebraska]]. Omaha is also the location of the county courthouse.

Arapahoe is located at {{coord|40|18|14|N|99|53|59|W|type:city}} (40.303959, -99.899839){{GR|1}}.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|0.99|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, all of it land.&lt;ref name =&quot;Gazetteer files&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In the spring of 1871, the Arapahoe Town Company was formed in [[Plattsmouth, Nebraska]], under the leadership of Captain E. B. Murphy, for the purpose of establishing a settlement in the [[Republican River]] valley.  The townsite was surveyed on July 18, 1871.&lt;ref name=cofc&gt;[http://www.arapahoe-ne.com/community.htm Arapahoe, Nebraska Chamber of Commerce.]  Retrieved 2011-05-16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=histnote&gt;[http://www.nebraskahistory.org/lib-arch/research/public/county_finding_aids/furnas.pdf &quot;Archives Record Historical Note&quot;.]  [http://nebraskahistory.org/index.shtml Nebraska State Historical Society.]  Retrieved 2011-05-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Company chose E. B. Murphy as the chairman of the board of trustees, C. Cowell, as the village clerk, and George W. Colvin as the village treasurer. The election was fairly informal: anyone in Furnas County who was 21 or older could vote.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

A post office was established in Arapahoe in 1872.&lt;ref name=casde&gt;Haussler, Lelia.  [http://www.casde.unl.edu/history/counties/furnas/arapahoe/ &quot;Arapahoe&amp;mdash;Furnas County&quot;.]  [http://www.casde.unl.edu/history/index.php Nebraska... Our Towns.]  Retrieved 2011-05-16.&lt;/ref&gt;  A sawmill and gristmill were constructed on Muddy Creek, west of the town; the sawmill provided timber for early construction.&lt;ref name=cofc/&gt;

In 1873, Furnas County was organized by the state legislature, with Arapahoe designated the county seat.  The designation was challenged by [[Beaver City, Nebraska|Beaver City]]; an 1873 election, followed my extensive litigation, moved the county seat to Beaver City in 1876.&lt;ref name=casde/&gt;&lt;ref name=histnote/&gt;

The city's first newspaper was the ''Pioneer'', established in 1879.  In 1882, the ''Arapahoe Public Mirror'' was established to support the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] in the county.  The ''Public Mirror'' is still in operation; in 1924, it absorbed the ''[[Holbrook, Nebraska|Holbrook]] Observer''; in 1978, it acquired the ''[[Elwood, Nebraska|Elwood]] Bulletin'', which it continues to publish under that name.&lt;ref name=mirror&gt;[http://www.arapahoemirror.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=33&amp;Itemid=17 &quot;History of Arapahoe Public Mirror &amp; Elwood Bulletin &quot;.]  [http://www.arapahoemirror.com/ ''Arapahoe Public Mirror&amp;mdash;Elwood Bulletin'']  Retrieved 2011-05-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arapahoe Telephone Company was established in 1904.  In the 1930s, a [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] project constructed a swimming pool and solarium at the city park, which had been part of the city's original layout.&lt;ref name=casde/&gt;

'''Wymore''' is a city in [[Gage County, Nebraska|Gage County]], [[Nebraska]], [[United States]]. The population was 1,457 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].

==History==
Wymore was founded on April 7, 1881 on land donated by Sam Wymore as a railroad town. The &quot;Welsh Capitol of the Great Plains,&quot; Wymore became home to generations of immigrants from [[Wales]], who continued their culture in day-to-day life, founding a [[Welsh-language]] church, school and cemetery, as well as preserving the Welsh traditions of poetry, dance, and intricate music in minor.

In 2000, the Wymore Welsh Heritage Project was founded to preserve the legacy of these early settlers. It has since expanded to include a museum, an archive of genealogical records, and one of the largest Welsh-language libraries in North America.

Wymore is home to the Southern Raiders, a class C school that serves students from Barneston, Holmesville, Blue Springs, Wymore, and Liberty.  The school has won 2 state championships, both in wrestling (1974 and 1980). The Wymore Arbor State baseball ballfield has one of the few covered, behind plate bleachers in the state.

Wymore, Nebraska is also the burial place of author and [[anthropology|anthropologist]] R. Clark Mallam, whose book, ''Indian Creek Memories; A Sense of Place'' is set in and around the town.

Before Kearney was named Kearney, it was called Dobytown and it was located {{convert|2|mi|km}} southeast of the present-day Kearney. Later the city was moved and renamed after the nearby [[Fort Kearny]] (with an extra &quot;e&quot; added, but pronounced the same), a [[United States Army]] outpost along the [[Oregon Trail]] in the middle 19th century. The fort was named after Col. and later General [[Stephen W. Kearny]].   The &quot;e&quot; was added by mistake sometime afterwards by postmen who consistently misspelled the town name.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}  Eventually it just stuck. The current location of the city is on the North side of the Platte River and steadily grew as a result of the influence of the railroad.

Recent{{When|date=July 2009}} growth in the city has been dramatic. The city is expanding quickly to the North, East, and West. The biggest employers in the city are the Good Samaritan Hospital and the University of Nebraska at Kearney. Other major employers include [[The Buckle]] Corporate Headquarters, Eaton Corporation, Baldwin Filters, [[Marshall Engines Inc]], and West Company Pharmaceuticals.

A little league team from Kearney participated in the [[2012 Little League World Series]] in Williamsport, PA.  They were Nebraska's first team to ever qualify for the series.

The council appoints a City Manager to implement policies, prepare a budget, appoints department heads, and recommends areas that the council needs to attend. There are five members elected city-wide serving staggered four year terms. One member of the City Council is chosen by the council to be Mayor. Stanley Clouse is the Mayor.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cityofkearney.org/documents/Administration/Kearney%20Connection%20December%202008.PDF The [[Kearney Connection]].

'''Alma''' is a city in [[Harlan County, Nebraska|Harlan County]], [[Nebraska]], [[United States]]. The population was 1,133 at the [[United States Census, 2010|2010 census]].  It is the [[county seat]] of [[Harlan County, Nebraska|Harlan County]]{{GR|6}}.  

==History==
Alma was founded in the spring of 1871 by a group of [[Union Pacific]] railroad laborers originally from [[Cheyenne, Wyoming]].  [[Harlan County, Nebraska|Harlan County]] was created by the [[Nebraska Legislature]] on June 3, 1871, and Alma was made the county seat on July 3, 1871.  A dispute among the original settlers led to a dissolution of the town, but it was re-organized in 1874. 

Alma's status as county seat was challenged by residents of [[Orleans, Nebraska|Orleans]], but an 1884 [[Nebraska Supreme Court]] decision affirmed Alma's status as seat of Harlan County.  Alma officially incorporated in July 1881.  The town was named after a daughter of one of the early settlers.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzpatrick, Lilian Linder (1925).  [http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&amp;context=englishunsllc &quot;Nebraska Place-Names&quot;.]  University of Nebraska Department of English.  Retrieved 2013-04-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 13, 1880, the [[Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad|Burlington Railroad]] reached Alma, providing a significant boost for local commerce and industry.  In 1887, the [[Kansas City and Omaha Railroad]] also reached Alma.  Telephone service reached Alma in June 1899.  [[Electricity]] arrived with a steam power plant in 1906 and water service followed in 1907.

In 1935, major flooding of the nearby [[Republican River]] provided an impetus to build a dam on the river.  The [[Army Corps of Engineers]] started construction of the Harlan County Dam on August 1, 1946, and completed work in November 1952. The lake thus created, [[Harlan County Reservoir]], became one of Alma's top recreation destinations.

Minden is the home of [[Harold Warp]]'s [[Pioneer Village (Nebraska)|Pioneer Village]].

Minden bills itself as &quot;Nebraska's Christmas City&quot;, illuminating the courthouse square with a display of over 12,000 bulbs and staging an annual Christmas pageant titled &quot;The Light Of The World&quot;.  The lighting of the courthouse was begun in 1915, when lights were acquired with the intention of stringing them from the railroad station to the town square for the state [[Grand Army of the Republic|G.A.R.]] convention; weather precluded this use, and the lights were repurposed for a Christmas display.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mindennebraska.org/index.aspx?nid=203 &quot;The Christmas City&quot;.]  [http://www.mindennebraska.org/ Minden, Nebraska website.] Retrieved 2011-12-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
St. Paul was founded by two young surveyors, James N. and Nicholas J. Paul, who had been surveying in Nebraska and the surrounding areas as the land opened to settlers.  Struck by the beauty and the prospects of the Loup valley, they took out homesteads, successfully petitioned the state legislature to form a new county to be known as Howard County, and laid out the townsite.  They brought the first settlers to the county in March 1871 and established the seat of government in St. Paul.  Stillman Hazeltine put up the first building for a general store and town hall in the summer of 1871.  That first building burned a few years later and the brick building which replaced it is still in use with his name and date 1871 on the front.

When the town was to be named, a committee collected the suggested names in a hat and the name Athens was drawn.  Since an Athens already existed in the state, Nebraska Senator Phineas W. Hitchcock suggested the name St. Paul in honor of the Paul brothers who founded it.  It officially became the county seat by vote in 1874 and was incorporated in 1881.  The first mayor was E.F. Clapp.

During its first twenty years, Howard County was a typical western frontier with covered wagons, cowboys, huge cattle herds, rowdy railroad construction gangs, and Army detachments stationed within its borders.  As settlers and the railroad extended north and west, the town of St. Paul served as an important trade center and quickly grew to a population of 2,000 residents.  From 1882 until 1917, St. Paul was the home of Frank Iams, the nation's largest importer of European draft horses.  Three-star General C.S. Irvine set record-shattering, long-distance flights in a B-29 shortly after World War II. Herbert Paul was Adjutant General of the Nebraska National Guard for 19 years.

St. Paul had a broom factory, canning factory, brick factory, cigar factory, two flour mills, hatchery and more.  Through the years innovation like the first self-rising flour was developed at one of the flour mills.  The first chicken hatchery in Nebraska started in Cushing in 1901, moved to St. Paul in 1922, and operated until 1956.  Pirus, a cure for many kidney and liver ailments, was invented in St. Paul.  [[Dorothy Lynch]] invented her famous salad dressing in St. Paul, which is now sold nationally.

The first two people executed in Nebraska's electric chair were sentenced for a murder they committed within Howard County.

[[Grover Cleveland Alexander]], who was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame, was born on a farm in the area and retired to St. Paul at the end of his sports career.  The American Legion baseball field was dedicated on June 15, 1971, and named after Alexander.

Grand Island is home to the Nebraska Law Enforcement Training Center (NLETC) which is the sole agency responsible for training law enforcement officers throughout the state, as well as the home of the [[Southern Power District]] serving southern Nebraska.

Grand Island has been given the [[All-America City Award]] three times (1955, 1967, and 1981–82) by the National Civic League.

Grand Island is the principal city of the [[Grand Island metropolitan area]], which consists of Hall, [[Merrick County, Nebraska|Merrick]], [[Howard County, Nebraska|Howard]] and [[Hamilton County, Nebraska|Hamilton]] counties.  The Grand Island metropolitan area has an official population of 83,472 residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Grand Island, you are officially a metro area|url=http://www.omaha.com/article/20130314/NEWS/703149868/1685#grand-island-you-are-officially-a-metro-area|publisher=Omaha World Herald|accessdate=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1857, 35 German settlers left [[Davenport, Iowa]], and headed west to Nebraska to start a new settlement on an island known by French traders as ''La Grande Isle'', which was formed by the [[Wood River]] and the [[Platte River]].  The settlers reached their destination on July 4, 1857, and by September had built housing using local timber. Over the next nine years, the settlers had to overcome many hardships, including blizzards and conflicts with Native Americans.&lt;ref name=website&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.grand-island.com/index.aspx?page=147 |title= The Pioneer Spirit |work= City of Grand Island, Nebraska |year=2011  |accessdate=June 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fall 1865, a surveyor for the Union Pacific Railroad discovered a vast prairie-dog village near present-day Grand Island.  He said, &quot;for a distance of ten miles the prairie is one vast prairie-dog village.  For miles and miles the ground is completely covered with their holes.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Ambrose, Stephen; &quot;Nothing Like it in the World&quot;, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;

Surveyors from the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] laid out a town called Grand Island Station and many settlers living on Grand Island moved to the new town, located slightly inland from the island.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.grand-island.com/index.aspx?page=253 |title=History |work=City of Grand Island, Nebraska |year=2011 |accessdate=June 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1868 the railroad reached the area, bringing increased trade and business. By 1870, 1,057 people lived in the town and in 1872 the town was incorporated as Grand Island.&lt;ref name=&quot;website&quot; /&gt;

In about 1890, [[sugar beets]] were introduced as a crop in Nebraska. The first sugar beet processing factory in the United States was built in the southwest part of Grand Island.&lt;ref name=website/&gt;

===1980 tornadoes===
{{Main|1980 Grand Island tornado outbreak}}

On June 3, 1980, Grand Island was hit by a massive [[supercell]] storm. Through the course of the evening, the city was ravaged by seven [[tornado]]es, the worst of which was rated F4 on the [[Fujita Scale]]. The hardest hit area of town was the South Locust business district. There were five deaths as a result of the tornadoes.

Tornado Hill is a local landmark created as a direct result of the tornadoes. Debris that could not be recycled was burnt near Fonner Park and buried within Ryder Park, on the west end of town.

'''Auburn''' is a city in [[Nemaha County, Nebraska|Nemaha County]], [[Nebraska]], [[United States]], and its [[county seat]]{{GR|6}}.  The population was 3,460 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. 

==History==
The City of Auburn is an incorporation of two towns. Calvert and Sheridan combined to form Auburn in 1882, in part to have the voting power to wrestle the county seat away from [[Brownville, Nebraska]], a village located nine miles east. The incorporation was successful, and in 1883, Auburn was named the county seat. 

The only person to be elected to the United States Congress as a member of the [[Prohibitionist]] Party, [[Charles Hiram Randall]], was born in Auburn on July 23, 1865.

==History==
O'Neill is named after its founder, John O'Neill, an Irish born American who brought settlers to Nebraska during the 1870s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.epodunk.com/cgi-bin/genInfo.php?locIndex=27515|title=Profile for O’Neill City, Nebraska, NE|publisher= ePodunk|accessdate= October 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Born in Clontibret, Co Monaghan, Ireland, he had previously served as a Colonel in the United States Army before resigning his commission and becoming active in the [[Fenian Brotherhood]]. It was this involvement in radical Irish politics that led him to become involved in the abortive [[Fenian raids]] of 1866, 1870, and 1871. Following a short prison term for his involvement in the 1871 raid, O'Neill became a land speculator and promoter of Irish settlement in Nebraska. He died in January 1878.

The community was incorporated in 1882.&lt;ref name=&quot;O’Neill Nebraska&quot;/&gt;

O'Neill is located at {{coord|42|27|39|N|98|38|49|W|type:city}} (42.460753, -98.647016){{GR|1}}.

==History==
Like most early western communities, Wisner's real existence dates only from the time of the arrival of the railroad. Settlers were in the vicinity as early as the mid-1850s, when the unincorporated community was known as &quot;Lakeview&quot;.

The town site was surveyed and platted in 1871 by J.W.E. Farrell and became incorporated on May 14, 1873. The [[Fremont, Elkhorn and Missouri Valley Railroad]] stockholders purchased the tract of land and named it Wisner after S.P. Wisner, a vice president of the [[Sioux City and Pacific Rail Road]]. The township where Wisner was platted, Elmont Township, was soon renamed Wisner Township.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}  The first [[Homestead Act|homesteader]] for the city of Wisner was Richard Thompson.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Growth in the community was constant as lots were sold and dwellings and businesses were erected. For eight years the town was the terminus of the railroad making it a central shipping point for agricultural products and livestock. Hence, the livestock feeding industry developed in close proximity of Wisner.  At the turn of the 20th century, Dr. Willet Price, in his autobiography &quot;Boots and Forceps&quot;, claimed that there were more [[Domestic pig|hogs]] within a twenty-five mile radius of Wisner than any other similar-sized region in the United States.  The cattle and hog [[feedlot]] industries remain the lifeblood of the region, along with the farming of feedcorn.

The local school district was formed in 1879, and within a few years Wisner High School produced its first graduates.  The high school and grade school shared the same facilities until 1916, when a &quot;state of the art&quot; high school was built.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}  The school district (listed as Cuming County School District #30) merged with Pilger, Nebraska in 1968 to create the present Wisner-Pilger school district, and a new building was constructed, which is still in use today.

==Wisner Landmarks==

Dinklage Park—Originally known as &quot;City Park&quot;, it was donated to the city by the railroad.  Located next to the original Wisner high school building, it featured a large [[gazebo]] and was often the site for graduations and school activities.  In 1960, a swimming pool was built on the site, and that pool was replaced in 1982 with a heated, Olympic-sized pool courtesy of contributions by Wisner cattleman [[Louis Dinklage]].  The park was renamed in honor of Louis and his wife Abby Faye in 1982.

Dutch Hollow—Formerly a wooded valley at the base of Nye Hill, it became one of the earliest settled parts of Wisner, and many of its oldest houses can be found here. Ninth Street in Wisner directly runs the route that Dutch Hollow ran, and this street is still referred to as &quot;Dutch Hollow&quot; by residents.

[[Elkhorn River]]—Wisner is located directly on the border of this tributary of the [[Platte River]], and it has been the source of several momentous events, such as major floods in 1966 and 1994, as well as a barge accident that killed three children in 1888.  Because the river runs at a southeast angle, the roads of Wisner run a similar path, and very few roads in Wisner actually run truly north, south, east or west, but at a severely altered angle.  In June 2010 floodwaters washed away the approach to the bridge, inconveniencing local travel and commerce.

Kane's Lake—A lake located directly south of the Elkhorn River, and the lake for which the unincorporated &quot;Lakeview&quot; (Wisner's original name) was named.

Land of Nod—This was an amusement park located just north of today's River Park, from 1917-1940. Founded by Wisner businessman Andy Peterson, it featured livestock show barns, a dance hall and an ice skating rink and was the site of Wisner's first baseball diamond.  It was an ambitious project that ultimately failed (mostly due to the development of the nearby City Park). Only the park's brick pillared entry and Peterson's home remains standing.

Nye Hill—The hill upon which a major portion of the city was built, and it was named for the veterinarian who built his home directly upon it, and who owned the majority of the surrounding property.  His home and the barn that he used for his practice still remain today.

River Park—Also called &quot;Community Park&quot; and perched directly by the Elkhorn River, this was built  on land purchased by the city of Wisner in 1927.  Over the years it has been the site of community baseball games (including several state tournaments), high school football (1933–1968), as well as snowmobile and motorcross racing.  Most recently, two fields for softball and youth baseball have been added (the softball fields have both served as the home field for the Wisner-Pilger High School softball team since the school started playing the sport in 2007), as well as a tractor pull arena for the annual &quot;[[Thunder By The River]]&quot; competition.  It also features a rodeo arena and show barns for livestock shows, and has been the site for countless community concerts and activities.

[[Rock Creek (Nebraska)|Rock Creek]]—The primary tributary of the Elkhorn River in the region, located south of Wisner.  It was the site of an unincorporated collection of German farmers in the late 19th century who felt shunned by area communities, particularly Wisner and [[Beemer, Nebraska]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}  The farmers formed a baseball team that became well known throughout Nebraska and Iowa, and was known for drawing large crowds to its games.  The &quot;Rock Creek Tigers&quot; played until 1952, when fielding a team became too expensive, and its remaining players began playing for Wisner and the [[West Point, Nebraska]] Bombers.&lt;ref&gt;Wisner News-Chronicle, April 11, 1952&lt;/ref&gt;

West Field—A pasture owned by the West family, where Wisner High first played football through 1930.  The Wisner Auditorium, the community tennis courts and the Wisner volunteer fire department are now located on this property.

&quot;The Blacktop&quot;—An asphalt-paved two-lane road leading south of Wisner, crossing the Elkhorn River. The road was paved in 1964, as the newly constructed Elkhorn River Bridge made it the only route into Wisner from the south. Its true name is &quot;6th Road&quot; (named in 1995 when postal routes were re-defined), but residents south of Wisner (including the Rock Creek community, which lies directly on its route) refer to it as &quot;The Blacktop&quot;, after a regional nickname for its asphalt surface. The road connects [[U.S. Highway 275]] Highway to [[Nebraska Highway 32]], which has made it well known as a significant shortcut to [[Lincoln, Nebraska]] for area travelers.

[[U.S. Route 275]]—Known as &quot;Highway 275&quot;, it runs directly through Wisner, forming Wisner's main street and business district.  Plans to divert Highway 275 to routes north of town (as part of a four lane expressway project) have been continually discussed, with local businesses hoping for a portion of the highway's traffic to continue to run though Wisner.

==History==

===Settlement and early history===
In late 1865, three scouts were sent from a German [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] settlement near [[Ixonia, Wisconsin]] to find productive, inexpensive farmland that could be claimed under the [[Homestead Act]]. From the Omaha area, they followed the [[Elkhorn River]] upstream to [[West Point, Nebraska|West Point]]. Finding that area too crowded, they continued up the river.  On September 15, they reached the junction of the Elkhorn and its North Fork, and chose that area as a settlement site.&lt;ref name=pangle&gt;Pangle, Mary Ellen.  ''A History of Norfolk''.  Published serially in ''Norfolk Daily News''.  1929.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1–2}}  On May 23, 1866, a party of 124 settlers representing 42 families from the Ixonia area set out for northeast Nebraska in three [[wagon train]]s. They arrived at the new site on July 15.&lt;ref name=pangle /&gt;{{rp|8}}  A second group of settlers from Wisconsin arrived in July 1867.&lt;ref name=pangle /&gt;{{rp|19}}

The original name of the colony was a variant of &quot;North Fork&quot;, but accounts differ on the exact name: &quot;Northfork&quot;,&lt;ref name=pangle /&gt;{{rp|32}} &quot;Nor'fork&quot;, and &quot;Nordfork&quot;&lt;ref name=perkey&gt;Perkey, Elton.  ''Perkey's Nebraska Place Names''.  Nebraska State Historical Socity.  1982.&lt;/ref&gt; are all suggested.  The name was submitted to federal postal authorities, and at some point was transmuted to &quot;Norfolk&quot;.  The pronunciation &quot;Norfork&quot; is still used by many Nebraskans.&lt;ref&gt;Koster, George E.  [http://www.dor.state.ne.us/history/docs/history-exec.pdf ''A History of the Principal Executives of the Nebraska State Highway Department''.]  Nebraska Department of Roads.  2005.  p. 12.  Retrieved 2010-01-02.&lt;/ref&gt;

The North Fork settlement had been named the county seat in 1867.&lt;ref name=pangle /&gt;{{rp|22}}  In 1875, a series of elections changed this.  In the first of these, Norfolk, which at the time had 45 voters, was eliminated; in a subsequent election, [[Madison, Nebraska|Madison]] was chosen over [[Battle Creek, Nebraska|Battle Creek]].&lt;ref name=pangle /&gt;{{rp|56–7}}

===Railroads and growth===
The [[Fremont, Elkhorn and Missouri Valley Railroad]] was built after the discovery of gold in the [[Black Hills]] in South Dakota; it ran from the Omaha area up the Elkhorn valley, then across northern Nebraska and into South Dakota.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.railstotrails.org/news/recurringFeatures/trailMonth/archives/0905.html &quot;Nebraska's Cowboy Trail&quot;.]  Rails-to-Trails Conservancy.  May 2009.  Retrieved 2010-01-02.&lt;/ref&gt;  Its arrival at Norfolk in 1879 connected the city through [[Wisner, Nebraska|Wisner]] to [[Blair, Nebraska|Blair]] on the Missouri.&lt;ref name=pangle /&gt;{{rp|60}}  The Omaha, Niobrara, and Black Hills branch of the [[Union Pacific Railroad|Union Pacific]] ran north from the railroad's main line at [[Duncan, Nebraska|Duncan]] to Norfolk;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ci.humphrey.ne.us/ &quot;Welcome to Humphrey, Nebraska&quot;.]  City of Humphrey website.  Retrieved 2010-01-02.&lt;/ref&gt; it reached the city in 1880.&lt;ref name=histbuild&gt;[http://www.nebraskahistory.org/histpres/reports/madison_county.pdf &quot;Madison County, Nebraska Historic Buildings Survey&quot;.]  Nebraska State Historical Society.

In 1900, the city had a population of 3,883, nearly quadruple its population of a decade earlier.  By 1910, it had more than 6,000 people, comprising roughly one-third of Madison County's population of 19,101.&lt;ref name=histbuild /&gt;{{rp|14}}  In 1915, petitions were filed for an election to move the county seat from Madison to Norfolk; however, the measure failed to secure the necessary number of votes.&lt;ref name=madisonhistory&gt;Madison County Historical Society.

In the 1910s, development began on the [[Meridian Highway]] as a direct north-south route across the United States; the route of the highway ran through Norfolk.  The 1924 completion of the [[Meridian Highway Bridge|Meridian Bridge]] across the Missouri River at the Nebraska-South Dakota border made the highway a continuous year-round thoroughfare.  In 1926, it was designated as [[U.S. Route 81|U.S. Highway 81]].&lt;ref name=meridian&gt;[http://www.nebraskahistory.org/histpres/nebraska/pierce/PC00-Meridian_Highway.pdf &quot;National Register of Historic Places Registration Form: Meridian Highway&quot;.]  Nebraska State Historical Society.

Air travel developed in Norfolk beginning with the establishment of a flying school in 1928.  The school's field gradually expanded and was improved.  In 1942, the [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] began construction of a municipal airport at the site.  Although construction materials were limited during World War II, Norfolk received priority as an auxiliary field to several war-related airports, including [[Sioux Gateway Airport|Sioux City Air Field]].  After the war, Norfolk congressman [[Karl Stefan]], a member of the Congressional Air Policy Board, used his influence to secure further funding for the airport.  Commercial passenger flight through the airport began in the early 1950s.&lt;ref name=airport1&gt;Ebeling, Mary R., and Christina Slattery.

In the 1970s, another attempt was made to move the county seat from Madison to Norfolk.  In a 1975 countywide election, the move's proponents failed to secure a simple majority.  A 60% majority would have been necessary for the measure to pass.&lt;ref name=madisonhistory/&gt;{{rp|8}}

==History==
Hastings was founded in 1872 at the intersection of the [[Burlington and Missouri River Railroad]] and the [[St. Joseph and Denver City Railroad]]. It was named for Colonel D.T. Hastings of the [[St. Joseph and Grand Island Railroad]], which built a line from Hastings to [[Grand Island, Nebraska|Grand Island]]. The area was previously open plain: the [[Donner party]] passed through on its way to [[California]] in 1846 and a pioneer cemetery marker in Hastings bears an inscription taken from Tamsen Donner's journal: &quot;The country between the Blue and the [[Platte River|Platte]] is beautiful beyond compare. Never have I seen so varied a country so suitable to cultivation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth H.

Hastings' first settlers were English, from [[Liverpool]], and were quickly joined by other English, Irish, Germans, Danes, and [[Volga Germans|Germans from Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;Spilinek, [http://books.google.com/books?id=7pUwEQKt8BkC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=%22providing+preservation,+prestige,+and+value+for+these+neighborhoods%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=VEu4S9XgEoX6lwft2vWVCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Danish%2C%20and%20Germans%20from%20Russia&amp;f=false p. 9].&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1872 and 1880, when the population had grown to 2,800, Hastings was a boomtown. Settlers first built sod houses, dugouts, and shanties, then houses and stores. The city was incorporated in April 1874, and in September 1878, after a five-year Great County Seat War, the county seat was transferred to Hastings from [[Juniata, Nebraska|Juniata]].&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Renschler, [http://www.adamshistory.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=33&amp;Itemid=42 Prairie to Prominence: Hastings' First 10 Years] at Adams County Historical Society, retrieved April 6, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; However, a fire in 1879 destroyed 33 buildings downtown. The city was rebuilt between 1880 and 1890 in fireproof materials and in a more planned fashion, with characteristically ornate [[Victorian architecture|Victorian buildings]], many designed by [[Charles C. Rittenhouse]], the first practicing architect in Adams County and also mayor for ten years.&lt;ref name=architects&gt;[http://www.adamshistory.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=43&amp;Itemid=42 Rittenhouse and Way: Architects of Hastings' First Half Century] at Adams County Historical Society, retrieved April 6, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Thanks to the railroads, the city enjoyed great prosperity during the [[Gilded Age]]. The population grew to 13,500.&lt;ref&gt;Spilinek, [http://books.google.com/books?id=7pUwEQKt8BkC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=%22providing+preservation,+prestige,+and+value+for+these+neighborhoods%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=VEu4S9XgEoX6lwft2vWVCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=13%2C500&amp;f=false p. 9].&lt;/ref&gt; This period of expansion ended with the drought and agricultural depression of the 1890s; the town's population fell to 7,000 and would not reach 15,000 until 1930.

Hastings saw renewed growth from 1900 to 1930, which is reflected by buildings in the [[American Craftsman|Craftsman]], [[Prairie School|Prairie]], [[Colonial Revival architecture|Colonial Revival]], and [[American Foursquare]] styles. The leading [[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and Crafts]] architect was [[Claude W. Way]].&lt;ref name=architects/&gt; Hastings had four brickyards and in 1911 was producing more bricks than any other city in Nebraska,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adamshistory.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=72&amp;Itemid=36 Central Hastings Historic District] at Adams County Historical Society, retrieved April 6, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and all the paving bricks.&lt;ref name=villageprofile&gt;Elizabeth Spilinek, [http://www.villageprofile.com/nebraska/hastings/01/topic.html History], Hastings, Nebraska Chamber of Commerce, 2006, retrieved April 6, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, the city also became known as the cigar-making capital of Nebraska. The largest cigar factory, the Kipp Cigar Company, was by 1921 hand-rolling one-fifth of all cigars produced in Nebraska; in 1925 it produced half, a total of 10 million.&lt;ref&gt;Spilinek, [http://books.google.com/books?id=7pUwEQKt8BkC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=%22providing+preservation,+prestige,+and+value+for+these+neighborhoods%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=VEu4S9XgEoX6lwft2vWVCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=cigar&amp;f=false p. 72].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adamshistory.org/index.php?Itemid=36&amp;id=57&amp;option=com_content&amp;task=view Kipp Cigar Company] at Adams County Historical Society, retrieved April 4, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Cigars lost their popularity to cigarettes between the two World Wars, and in the 1930s the [[Great Depression]] again brought the town's expansion to a halt.

In 1942, the Naval Ammunition Depot was constructed, initiating explosive growth: Hastings' population grew from 15,000 to 23,000 in under a year and there was a critical shortage of housing, which prompted both alteration of existing housing stock and rapid construction of new neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt;Spilinek, [http://books.google.com/books?id=7pUwEQKt8BkC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=%22providing+preservation,+prestige,+and+value+for+these+neighborhoods%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=VEu4S9XgEoX6lwft2vWVCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA#v=snippet&amp;q=less%20than%20a%20year&amp;f=false p. 10].&lt;/ref&gt; Once [[World War II]] ended, staff was reduced at the ammunition depot, bringing Hastings' last growth period to an end in 1950, and the depot eventually closed.

Today, Heartwell Park and Central Hastings, two of the oldest neighborhoods, are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name=&quot;p. 10&quot;&gt;Spilinek, [http://books.google.com/books?id=7pUwEQKt8BkC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=%22providing+preservation,+prestige,+and+value+for+these+neighborhoods%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=VEu4S9XgEoX6lwft2vWVCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22providing%20preservation%2C%20prestige%2C%20and%20value%20for%20these%20neighborhoods%22&amp;f=false p. 10].&lt;/ref&gt; The Hastings Symphony Orchestra performs in the [[Chautauqua Pavilion (Hastings, Nebraska)|Chautauqua Pavilion]], built in 1907 and on the National Register of Historic Places, while the Hastings Community Theatre performs in the auditorium of the former Spencer Park School, built during the housing shortage of the 1940s. The city has adapted several of its historic buildings to new uses. [[Central Community College (Nebraska)|Central Community College]] is housed in buildings of the former Naval Ammunition Depot. Lincoln Elementary School, built in 1912, is now the police headquarters. The [[Clarke Hotel]], built in 1914 and also on the National Register of Historic Places, is now the Kensington, a home for senior citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Spilinek, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Spencer Park, an 840-unit &quot;village&quot; built to house workers in the 1940s, is now Good Samaritan Retirement Village.&lt;ref name=villageprofile/&gt;

==Fisher Fountain==
[[File:Fisher Rainbow Fountain from S.JPG|thumb|alt=Circular fountain in park with water jets coming from sides|Fisher Rainbow Fountain; in the background is the Hastings Utilities complex]]

The Jacob Fisher Rainbow Fountain in Highland Park, Hastings, is the largest water fountain between Chicago and Denver.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} The fountain shoots continuously changing arrays of water jets (reaching heights of 67 feet) while green, yellow, orange, red, magenta, and blue lights illuminate the water in varying patterns.

Fisher Fountain was originally a temporary exhibit at the 1932 Adams County Fair, called the Electric Fountain. It was invented by Edward R. Howard and became a symbol of hope during the [[Great Depression]] and [[Dust Bowl]]. Because of its popularity, it was moved to the park and made permanent. A competition among schoolchildren to rename it resulted in two winning names that were combined: Rainbow Fountain, and Fisher Fountain after Mayor Jacob Fisher.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adamshistory.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=116&amp;Itemid=48 Fountain to Fountain Tour Book] at Adams County Historical Society, retrieved April 4, 2010.

Fisher Fountain was renovated in 1982 but was then dynamited by vandals in 1984. Its destruction aroused a strong community response. $63,000 was raised to rebuild it, and it was rededicated on Mother's Day in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;Adams County Historical Society.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Nebraska State Legislature]] has credited the town as being the second oldest settlement in Nebraska. It was once the seat of government in Nebraska.&lt;ref&gt;(1912) ''Bulletin.'' Issues 2. Nebraska State Legislature. p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Fur country===
[[Image:Pawnee01.png|thumb|Tribal territory of the [[Otoe tribe|Otoe]]]]
Settlement of what became Bellevue began when a [[fur trade|fur trading]] post was built in 1822 by [[Joshua Pilcher]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://nebraskastudies.org/0400/frameset_reset.html?http://nebraskastudies.org/0400/stories/0401_0123.html The Fur Traders: Joshua Pilcher] Nebraska Studies. Retrieved August 8, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; then president of the [[Missouri Fur Company]] based in [[St. Louis]].  The post was later known as [[Fontenelle's Post]] after being run by Lucien Fontenelle, a fur trader who purchased it in 1828 to represent the [[American Fur Company]].  The Post served as a central trading point with local [[Omaha (tribe)|Omaha]], [[Otoe tribe|Otoe]], [[Missouri (tribe)|Missouri]] and [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]] tribes.  Early [[French Canadian]] trappers named the area ''Belle Vue'' because of the beauty of the view from the bluffs overlooking the [[Missouri River]]. 

With the decline in the fur trade, in 1832 Fontenelle sold the post to the US government to be used for the Missouri River Indian Agency (also called the Bellevue Agency).  When [[Baptist]] [[missionaries]] Moses and Eliza Merrill arrived in 1833, the US Indian agent let them stay temporarily at the post. 

In 1835 the Merrills moved with the Otoe about eight miles to the west, where they established what was known as the Otoe or [[Moses Merrill Mission]].  Fontenelle's Post was abandoned about 1839-1842.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nebraskahistory.org/publish/publicat/newsletr/feb99.htm &quot;Early trading posts are subject of new book&quot;] Nebraska State Historical Society Historical Newsletter, February 1999, accessed 5 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In 1839 the [[Pirate (steamboat)|Steamboat ''Pirate'']] sank on the Missouri near Bellevue. In the 1830s a [[Log Cabin (Bellevue, Nebraska)|log cabin]] was built at present-day 805 Hancock Street, that still stands today.

Colonel [[Peter Sarpy]], a [[Louisiana Creole people|French Creole]] fur trader who also was based in St. Louis, established a trading post across the river from Bellevue in what became Iowa. It chiefly supplied the expeditions of European and United States settlers bound for [[Oregon]] and later, [[California]]'s [[Gold Rush]].  About 1846, Sarpy also set up a ferry between Bellevue and St. Mary's, Iowa.  By the 1850s, one of his ferries ran by steam.  Bellevue was also a location of Mormon settlement around 1850.&lt;ref&gt;[http://winterquarters.byu.edu/pages/settlements.htm website on &quot;Winter Quarters and other Mormon settlements in the Omaha region&quot;], Brigham Young University&lt;/ref&gt;  

As a prominent businessman, Sarpy was active in community affairs in Bellevue.  He helped [[plat]] and organize the town. In addition, he platted [[Decatur, Nebraska|Decatur]].  The Nebraska legislature named Sarpy County after him in appreciation.

Ideally situated on the Missouri River with access to the [[Platte River]] Valley, Bellevue continued to grow.  The community became a hub for transfer of manufactured goods from the East and furs from the West.  From the 1840s until the 1850s, Bellevue prospered.

With the decline of the fur trade, Bellevue changed during the decade of the 1850s to a more mixed economy.  As eastern Nebraska was opened to European-American settlement in 1854 after the US gained cession of the [[Omaha]] people's lands in the [[Native American tribes in Nebraska#Tribes and treaties|Treaty of 1854]], Bellevue experienced a building boom.  The First Presbyterian Church, a bank, a hotel, and dozens of private homes were among the new structures built.  The boom was short-lived, however.  The expansion accompanied a belief that the city was to be selected as the capital of the [[Nebraska Territory]].  Since the city was the oldest and most widely known settlement in the territory, Bellevue residents were optimistic.  The new territorial governor, [[Francis Burt (Nebraska)|Francis Burt]], had already moved into a residence in Bellevue.  Shortly after arriving, Governor Burt died.

His successor T.B. Cuming selected a new upstart community as the territorial capital — Omaha, to the north on the Missouri River.  This became the center of economic development.

===Decline===
The second half of the century witnessed Bellevue's slip into relative obscurity. While Omaha grew from a few hundred in population in 1855 to 104,000 in 1890, Bellevue's numbers continued to slide until the city was near extinction. In 1876, the county seat was transferred to [[Papillion, Nebraska|Papillion]], {{convert|10|mi|km}} to the west.

In the 1890s, the city's offer of inexpensive land brought [[Offutt Air Force Base#Fort Crook|Fort Crook]] to the Bellevue area. The fort provided impetus to Bellevue's population growth in the future.  In 1966, Bellevue College (now [[Bellevue University]]) was established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bellevue.edu/about/history.aspx |title=Bellevue University &amp;#124; History |publisher=Bellevue.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1880s to 1940, Bellevue's population grew minimally, from around 500 to not more than 1200 in 1940. The small growth was primarily due to the improved transportation access to Omaha, which allowed for easier commuting for workers.

===Offutt Air Force Base===
Fort Crook, later named and redesigned as [[Offutt Air Force Base]], spurred Bellevue's largest growth.  Offutt became home to the huge Martin bomber plant during [[World War II]] and, shortly after the war, housed the headquarters of the [[Strategic Air Command]].  It attracted thousands of workers, both civilian and military, who made Bellevue their home. Bellevue's population grew from less than 1200 in 1940 to almost 4000 in 1950 and then almost 9000 ten years later. A decade later, Bellevue's population again more than doubled, to more than 20,000.

The Martin Bomber Plant was the site of manufacture for the historically significant [[Enola Gay]] and [[Bockscar]], the planes used by the US to drop atomic bombs on [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], Japan, respectively, ending the Pacific war.

[[Offutt Air Force Base]] is the location of the [[55th Wing]], [[United States Strategic Command]] and the [[Air Force Weather Agency]].

The first divided highway in Nebraska was built from the south Omaha city limits to Offutt Air Force Base.  Today known as Fort Crook Road, it was finished December 8, 1941, the day after the attacks at [[Pearl Harbor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dm.net/~chris-g/ne-facts.html |title=The Nebraska Highways Page: Facts About Nebraska Highways |publisher=Dm.net |date= |accessdate=2012-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Today===
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2011}}
Bellevue's growth today is primarily due to an expanding economy in the civilian sector.  The Kennedy Freeway, a limited-access [[highway]] linked to the [[Interstate Highway System]], has stimulated a new building boom.  Commercial, industrial, and residential construction are all expanding.  During the 1990s, the city's population grew by 47.5%.  Economic and population growth has continued since the turn of the 20th to 21st century.

Bellevue is the site of [[Fontenelle Forest]], {{convert|1400|acre|km2}} of privately owned forestland with {{convert|19|mi|km}} of hiking trails, with views of the Missouri River and the surrounding area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fontenelleforest.org/come.html &quot;General Information&quot;.]  [http://www.fontenelleforest.org/index.html Fontenelle Nature Association.]  Retrieved 2011-01-03.&lt;/ref&gt;  It includes the site of Fontenelle's Post.  Haworth Park at the Missouri River is also a popular tourist attraction, featuring the start of a walking trail that stretches many miles across Bellevue.

The eagerly anticipated Bellevue Medical Center&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bellevuemed.com bellevuemed.com]&lt;/ref&gt; opened on May 17, 2010.  The hospital is located at the corner of Highway 370 and 25th Street.

Bellevue's current mayor is Rita Sanders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bellevue.net/CityGovernment/MayorsOffice.aspx |title=Mayor's Office |publisher=Bellevue.net |date= |accessdate=2012-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bellevue.net/Home.aspx |title=City of Bellevue Nebraska &gt; Home |publisher=Bellevue.net |date= |accessdate=2012-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fairbury''' is a city and [[county seat]] of [[Jefferson County, Nebraska|Jefferson County]], [[Nebraska]], [[United States]].{{GR|6}}  The population was 3,942 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].

Fairbury has been closely connected with railroading for much of its history.  It was founded on the projected route of a railway, and grew as a shipping center.  For nearly 80 years, it was the location of the Western Division headquarters of the [[Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad|Rock Island Railroad]].  Fairbury prospered with the Rock Island, and lost business and residents as the railroad declined.

In 1868, James B. Mattingly, a freighter originally from Kentucky, established a sawmill on the banks of the [[Little Blue River (Kansas/Nebraska)|Little Blue River]].  Shortly thereafter, Woodford G. McDowell, a capitalist from [[Fairbury, Illinois]], came to Nebraska to plat a town along the route of the St. Joseph and Denver City Railroad, which was to follow the Little Blue.  In 1869, Mattingly and McDowell each contributed {{Convert|80|acre}} for a new townsite, which they named after McDowell's hometown.&lt;ref name=survey/&gt;&lt;ref name=casde/&gt;&lt;ref name=fairhist/&gt;

The new town grew rapidly, even before the railroad's arrival.  In 1870, a population of 370 was reported; in that year, the ''Fairbury Gazette'' was established.  A year later, Fairbury was chosen as the county seat; in early 1872, the city was incorporated.  By this time, its businesses included three hotels and five blacksmith shops.&lt;ref name=survey/&gt;&lt;ref name=casde/&gt;&lt;ref name=nomform/&gt;

In 1872, the St. Joseph and Denver City reached Jefferson County.  (The railroad was subsequently acquired by the [[Union Pacific Railroad|Union Pacific]] and operated as the St. Joseph and Grand Island branch.) Fairbury became a shipping center: in the first half of 1873, it shipped 255 cars of grain and received 143 of lumber.  By 1874, there were 600 residents; 44 businesses operated in the city.&lt;ref name=nomform/&gt;

An 1879 fire, &quot;supposed to have been the work of an incendiary&quot;,&lt;ref name=andreas/&gt; destroyed an estimated fourteen buildings, for a loss of $50,000, much of it uninsured.  However, recovery was swift, and many of the destroyed frame buildings were replaced by more modern brick and stone structures.  By 1882, the city's population had grown to 1,600.&lt;ref name=nomform/&gt;&lt;ref name=andreas/&gt;

In 1885, the Campbell Brothers Circus began wintering in Fairbury.  It continued to winter in and around the city until its closing in 1913.  At its peak, the circus was the second-largest in the world.&lt;ref name=circus/&gt;

In 1886, the [[Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad]] reached Fairbury.  The city lay at the junction of the Rock Island's north-south and east-west lines; because of this, it was designated the headquarters of the railroad's Western Division.  An extensive rail yard was constructed, including shops, storage and maintenance facilities, switching yards, and an 18-stall [[roundhouse]].  The railroad had a major impact on Fairbury: by 1890, the population had grown to 2,630.&lt;ref name=survey/&gt;&lt;ref name=depot/&gt;

The brick courthouse had survived the fire of 1879;&lt;ref name=andreas/&gt; but soon thereafter, it proved too small to handle the county's increasing business and store its growing records.  In 1882, the county began renting the top two floors of the newly-constructed Opera House, and moved its offices there; but this too was quickly outgrown.  In 1889, a $60,000 bond issue for the construction of a new courthouse passed; the new [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Romanesque Revival]] building was completed in 1892.&lt;ref name=courthouse/&gt;

Fairbury continued to prosper as the home of the Rock Island headquarters, which employed many locals directly and in supporting businesses.  Commercial and residential development continued apace in Fairbury.  Both of the city's banks survived the [[Panic of 1893]].  Boardwalks were replaced with brick sidewalks between 1892 and 1894; an electricity and waterworks powerhouse was constructed in 1895; and in 1898, electric street lights were installed.  By 1900, the population had reached 3,140.&lt;ref name=survey/&gt;&lt;ref name=nomform/&gt;

===20th century===
The decade from 1900 to 1910 saw the largest growth in Fairbury's history; the census of 1910 reported a population of 5,294, representing a sixty percent increase over the ten years.&lt;ref name=nomform/&gt;

A major fire in 1903 swept the commercial district, destroying almost the entire block south of the courthouse square; the only building to survive was the original brick courthouse.  Within a year, however, the entire block had been rebuilt.&lt;ref name=nomform/&gt; 

In 1909, E. J. Hested opened his dime store, The Fair Store, in one of the new buildings.  Two years later, the name of the store was changed to Hested's.  In 1925, the store moved into a new and larger building; the business expanded to over 150 stores in the Midwest and Mountain States before its acquisition by the [[J.J. Newberry]] chain in 1969.&lt;ref name=hested/&gt;

The 1910s and 1920s were the peak years for the Rock Island Railroad, with fourteen passenger trains passing through Fairbury daily, and with hundreds of Fairbury residents on the payroll.  To accommodate this traffic, the railroad constructed a new depot, at a cost of $40,000.&lt;ref name=depot/&gt;  The city's commercial district underwent a considerable expansion, including two movie theaters and several large retail stores.&lt;ref name=nomform/&gt;  In 1915, civic leaders began promoting the brick paving of Fairbury's downtown streets; by 1930, there were {{Convert|10|mi}} of paved road.&lt;ref name=survey/&gt;  The 1920s and 1930s saw a proliferation of automobile-related businesses, such as garages, gas stations, and repair shops.&lt;ref name=nomform/&gt;

Fairbury was better situated than many communities to weather the [[Great Depression]].  Beside the railroad, it had a variety of industries, including the Fairbury Windmill Company, with a payroll of 50 people in 1930.  The city continued to grow through the Depression,&lt;ref name=survey/&gt; despite the difficulties of the Rock Island, which went into [[receivership]] in 1933 and did not emerge until 1948.&lt;ref name=arkansas/&gt;  The population of Fairbury peaked in 1950, at 6,395 residents.&lt;ref name=survey/&gt;

The conversion of the Rock Island to [[diesel locomotive]]s, completed by 1952, rendered portions of the Fairbury yards obsolete.  The decrease in passenger railway traffic after World War II led to the reduction of service, the closing of stations, and the abandonment of track.  In 1965, the Rock Island's Chicago-to-Denver ''[[Rocky Mountain Rocket]]'' train ceased to run through Fairbury; in that same year, the railway relocated its Western Division headquarters from Fairbury to [[Des Moines, Iowa]].&lt;ref name=depot/&gt;  1965 was also the last year in which the Rock Island reported a profit.  In 1975, it again entered receivership.  A 1979 strike, unsuccessfully mediated by [[Jimmy Carter|President Jimmy Carter]], was the final nail in the railroad's coffin.&lt;ref name=arkansas/&gt;  The railroad's routes were operated for 60 days by the [[Kansas City Terminal Railway]], to allow shipping of the 1979 Midwestern harvest;&lt;ref name=kcterminal/&gt; but in 1980, service to Fairbury ceased, and the depot was abandoned.&lt;ref name=depot/&gt;

[[Richard Mentor Johnson|Richard M Johnson]], for whom Johnson County was named, although Johnson was never married. Shortly after being founded, the name was changed to [[Tecumseh]] to honor the Native American chief said to have been killed by Johnson during the 
[[Battle of the Thames]]. The Nebraska Territorial Legislature established Tecumseh as the county seat on February 13, 1857.

The town was used largely for the setting of the mini-series ''[[Amerika (TV miniseries)|Amerika]]'', which depicted life in a small American town after a successful takeover by the [[Soviet Union]].

'''Omaha''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|oʊ|m|ə|h|ɑː}} is the largest city in the state of [[Nebraska]], [[United States]], and is the [[county seat]] of [[Douglas County, Nebraska|Douglas County]].{{GR|6}} It is located in the [[Midwestern United States]] on the [[Missouri River]], about 10&amp;nbsp;miles (16&amp;nbsp;km) north of the mouth of the [[Platte River]]. Omaha is the anchor of the [[Omaha-Council Bluffs metropolitan area]], which includes [[Council Bluffs, Iowa|Council Bluffs]], [[Iowa]], across the Missouri River from Omaha.

According to the [[2010 United States Census|2010 Census]], Omaha's population was 408,958, making it the nation's 42nd-largest city. According to the 2012 Population Estimates, Omaha's population was 421,570. Including its suburbs, Omaha formed the 60th-largest [[metropolitan area]] in the United States in 2012, with an estimated population of 885,624 residing in eight [[County (US)|counties]]. The Omaha-Council Bluffs-Fremont, NE-IA Combined Statistical Area is 922,051, according to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2012 estimate.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Combined_Statistical_Areas&lt;/ref&gt; There are more than 1.2 million residents within a 50-mile (80-km) radius of [[Downtown Omaha|the city's center]], forming the Greater Omaha area.

Omaha's pioneer period began in 1854 when the city was founded by speculators from neighboring Council Bluffs, Iowa. The city was founded along the Missouri River, and a crossing called [[Lone Tree Ferry]] earned the city its nickname, the &quot;Gateway to the West.&quot; It introduced this new West to the world when in 1898 it played host to the World's Fair, dubbed the [[Trans-Mississippi Exposition]]. During the 19th century, Omaha's central location in the United States spurred the city to become an important national [[Transportation in Omaha|transportation hub]]. Throughout the rest of the 19th century, the transportation and [[Wholesale|jobbing]] sectors were important in the city, along with its [[Railroads in Omaha|railroads]] and [[Brewery|breweries]]. In the 20th century, the [[Omaha Stockyards]], once the world's largest, and its [[meatpacking]] plants, gained international prominence.

Today, Omaha is the home to the headquarters of five [[Fortune 500]] companies: packaged-food giant [[ConAgra Foods]]; the U.S.'s largest railroad operator, [[Union Pacific Corporation]]; insurance and financial firm [[Mutual of Omaha]]; one of the world's largest construction companies, [[Kiewit Corporation]]; and mega-conglomerate [[Berkshire Hathaway]].&lt;ref&gt;Boettcher, Ross.

The [[Gallup Organization]], of [[Gallup Poll]] fame, also is based in Omaha, with its riverfront Gallup University. [[Enron]] began in Omaha as Northern Natural Gas in 1930 before taking over a smaller Houston company in 1985 to form [[Enron|InterNorth]], which was moved permanently to Houston in 1987 by the notorious [[Kenneth Lay]].

The modern [[economy of Omaha]] is diverse and built on skilled knowledge jobs. In 2009, ''[[Forbes]]'' identified Omaha as the nation's number one &quot;Best Bang-For-The Buck City&quot; and number one on &quot;America's Fastest-Recovering Cities&quot; list. [[Tourism in Omaha]] benefits the city's economy greatly, with the annual [[College World Series]] providing important revenue and the city's [[Henry Doorly Zoo]] serving as the top attraction in Nebraska. Omaha hosted the U.S. Olympic swim trials in 2008, 2012, and will host the event again in 2016.

A [[historic preservation]] movement in Omaha has led to a number of historic structures and districts being designated [[Omaha Landmark]]s or listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. Much of the push toward preservation came after Omaha gained the notorious designation of having, in 1989, demolished the largest-ever [[National Register]] historic district in the United States, a record that still stands as of 2013. The [[Jobbers Canyon Historic District]], along the Missouri River, was felled for a new headquarters campus for ConAgra Foods, a company which threatened to relocate if Omaha did not allow them to raze the city's historic district. The Jobber's Canyon warehouses had before then been allowed to deteriorate and were the scene of several fires set by the homeless population that had come to live in the abandoned buildings. At the time, there were no plans in place for revitalizing the buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Gratz, R.B. (1996) ''Living City: How America's Cities Are Being Revitalized by Thinking Small in a Big Way.''

Various [[Native American tribes in Nebraska|Native American tribes]] had lived in the land that became Omaha, including since the 17th century, the [[Omaha (tribe)|Omaha]] and [[Ponca]], Dhegian-Siouan-language people who had originated in the lower Ohio River valley and migrated west by the early 17th century; [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]], [[Otoe tribe|Otoe]], [[Missouri (tribe)|Missouri]], and [[Ioway]].

In 1804 the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] passed by the riverbanks where the city of Omaha would be built. Between July 30 and August 3, 1804, members of the expedition, including [[Meriwether Lewis]] and [[William Clark (explorer)|William Clark]], met with Oto and Missouria tribal leaders at the [[Council Bluff]] at a point about 20&amp;nbsp;miles (30&amp;nbsp;km) north of present-day Omaha.&lt;ref&gt;(1987) &quot;Fort Atkinson Chronology&quot;, ''NEBRASKAland Magazine.'' p. 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately south of that area, Americans built several fur trading outposts in succeeding years, including [[Fort Lisa (Nebraska)|Fort Lisa]] in 1812;&lt;ref&gt;[[Julius Sterling Morton|Morton, J.S.]], Watkins, A. and [[George L.

Through 26 separate treaties with the United States federal government, [[Native American tribes in Nebraska]] gradually ceded the lands currently comprising the state. The treaty and cession involving the Omaha area occurred in 1854 when the [[Omaha Tribe]] ceded most of east-central Nebraska.&lt;ref&gt;Royce, C.C.

[[Native American tribes in Nebraska|Native Americans]] were the first residents in the Omaha area. The city of Omaha was established by European Americans from neighboring Council Bluffs who arrived from the [[Northeast United States]] a few years earlier. While much of the early population was of [[Yankee]] stock, over the next 100 years numerous [[Ethnic groups in Omaha, Nebraska|ethnic groups]] moved to the city. In 1910, the Census Bureau reported Omaha's population as 96.4% White and 3.6% Black.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Race and Hispanic Origin for Selected Cities and Other Places: Earliest Census to 1990|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|url=http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html|accessdate=April 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Irish in Omaha, Nebraska|Irish]] immigrants in Omaha originally moved to an area in present-day North Omaha called &quot;Gophertown&quot;, as they lived in dirt dugouts.&lt;ref&gt;Barstow, D.

Caxton Press. p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; That population was followed by [[Poles in Omaha, Nebraska|Polish immigrants]] in the [[Sheelytown]] neighborhood, and many immigrants were recruited for jobs in South Omaha's [[Union Stockyards (Omaha)|stockyards]] and meatpacking industry.&lt;ref&gt;Peattie, E.W. &quot;How they live at Sheely: Pen picture of a strange settlement and its queer set of inhabitants,&quot; March 31, 1895. in (2005) ''Impertinences: Selected Writings of Elia Peattie, a Journalist in the Gilded Age''.

In the early 20th century, [[Jews and Judaism in Omaha, Nebraska|Jewish]] immigrants set up numerous businesses along the [[North 24th Street]] commercial area. It suffered with the loss of industrial jobs in the 1960s and later, and the shifting of population west of the city. The commercial area is now the center of the [[African Americans in Omaha, Nebraska|African American community]], concentrated in North Omaha.&lt;ref&gt;(1980) ''A Comprehensive Program for Historic Preservation in Omaha'', [[Government of Omaha|City of Omaha]] [[Landmarks Heritage Preservation Commission]]. p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; The African-American community has maintained its social and religious base, while it is currently experiencing an economic revitalization.

{{Ethnic Omaha (sidebar)}}
With the expansion of railroad and industrial jobs in meatpacking, Omaha attracted many new immigrants and migrants. As the major city in Nebraska, it has historically been more racially and ethnically diverse than the rest of the state.&lt;ref&gt;Baltensperger, B.H. (1985) ''Nebraska: a geography.'' Westview Press. p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; At times rapid population change, overcrowded housing and job competition have aroused racial and ethnic [[Racial Tension in Omaha, Nebraska|tensions]]. Around the start of the 20th century, violence towards new immigrants in Omaha often erupted out of suspicions and fears.&lt;ref&gt;Hickey, D.R., Wunder, S.A. and Wunder, J.R. (2007) ''Nebraska Moments: New Edition.'' University of Nebraska Press. p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Greeks in Omaha, Nebraska|Greek Town]] Riot in 1909 flared after increased Greek immigration, Greeks' working as strikebreakers, and the killing of an Irish policeman provoked violence among earlier immigrants such as ethnic Irish.&lt;ref&gt;Laliotou, I.L. (2004) ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=f_WL0HT1_4EC&amp;dq Transatlantic Subjects: Acts of Migration and Cultures of Transnationalism Between Greece and America], University of Chicago Press. p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; That mob violence forced the [[Greeks in Omaha, Nebraska|Greek]] immigrant population to flee from the city.&lt;ref&gt;Laliotou, I.

(2004) &quot;Omaha, Nebraska,&quot; in ''Encyclopedia of the Great Plains.'' University of Nebraska Press. p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; Six years after the Greek Town Riot, in 1915, a Mexican immigrant named Juan Gonzalez was killed by a mob near [[Scribner, Nebraska|Scribner]], a town in the Greater Omaha metropolitan area. The event occurred after an [[Omaha Police Department]] officer was investigating a criminal operation selling goods stolen from the nearby railroad yards. [[Racial profiling]] targeted Gonzalez as the culprit. After escaping the city, he was trapped along the [[Elkhorn River]], where the mob, including several policemen from Omaha, shot him more than twenty times. Afterward it was discovered that Gonzalez was unarmed, and that he had a reliable alibi for the time of the murder. Nobody was ever indicted for his lynching.&lt;ref&gt;De La Garza, M. (2004) &quot;The Lynching of Juan Gonzalez,&quot; ''Nebraska History.'' 85. (Spring). p. 24–35.&lt;/ref&gt; In the fall of 1919, following [[Red Summer]], postwar social and economic tensions, the earlier hiring of blacks as strikebreakers, and job uncertainty contributed to a mob from South Omaha lynching [[Willy Brown]] and the ensuing [[Omaha Race Riot of 1919|Omaha Race Riot]]. Trying to defend Brown, the city's mayor, [[Edward Parsons Smith]], was lynched also, surviving only after a quick rescue.&lt;ref&gt;Bristow, D. (2000) ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=NSlkKlI5dY4C&amp;dq A Dirty, Wicked Town: Tales of 19th Century Omaha]''. Caxton Press. p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to other industrial cities in the U.S., Omaha suffered severe job losses in the 1950s, more than 10,000 in total, as both the railroad and meatpacking industries restructured. Stockyards and packing plants were located closer to ranches, and union achievements were lost as wages declined in surviving jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Cordes, H.J. [http://www.omaha.com/index.php?u_page=2798&amp;u_sid=10176422 &quot;Decline in industrial jobs hurts blacks&quot;] ''Omaha World-Herald''. November 5, 2007. Retrieved 9/23/08.&lt;/ref&gt; Many workers left the area if they could get to other jobs. Poverty deepened in areas of the city whose residents had depended on those jobs, specifically North and South Omaha. At the same time, with reduced revenues, the city had less financial ability to respond to longstanding problems. Despair after the assassination of Dr. [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] in April 1968 contributed to riots in North Omaha, including one at the [[Logan Fontenelle Housing Project]].&lt;ref&gt;Luebtke, F.C. (2005) ''Nebraska: An Illustrated History.'' University of Nebraska Press. p. 334.&lt;/ref&gt; For some, the [[Civil Rights Movement in Omaha, Nebraska]] evolved towards [[black nationalism]], as the [[Black Panther Party]] was involved in tensions in the late 1960s. Organizations such as the [[Black Association for Nationalism Through Unity]] became popular among the city's African-American youth. This tension culminated in the ''[[cause célèbre]]'' trial of the [[Rice/Poindexter Case]], in which an [[Omaha Police Department]] officer was killed by a bomb while answering an emergency call. After 5 years of obscurity, the black population was finally able to vote.

Whites in Omaha have followed the [[white flight]] pattern, [[suburban]]izing to West Omaha over time.&lt;ref&gt;French, K. (2002) &quot;Ethnic Groups in the Urban Fringe: An Analysis of Residential Patterns in Four Midland Cities, 1960 to 2000.&quot; University of Nebraska-Lincoln.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1990s and early 2000s, gang violence and incidents between the [[Omaha Police Department]] and members of the African-American community aggravated relations between groups in North and South Omaha. More recent Hispanic immigrants, concentrated in South Omaha, have struggled to earn living wages in meatpacking, adapt to a new society, and deal with discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;Webb, M.

===Music===

[[File:CenturyLink Center Omaha.jpg|right|500px|CenturyLink Center Omaha]]
Omaha's rich history in rhythm and blues, and jazz gave rise to a number of influential bands, including [[Anna Mae Winburn]]'s [[Cotton Club Boys]] and [[Lloyd Hunter]]'s Seranaders. [[Rock and roll]] pioneer [[Wynonie Harris]]; jazz great [[Preston Love]]; drummer [[Buddy Miles]]; and [[Luigi Waites]] are among the city's homegrown talent. [[Doug Ingle]] from the late 1960s band [[Iron Butterfly]] was born in Omaha as was indie-folk singer/songwriter [[Elliott Smith]], though both were raised elsewhere.

Contemporary music groups either located in or originally from Omaha include [[Mannheim Steamroller]], [[Bright Eyes (band)|Bright Eyes]], [[The Faint]], [[Cursive (band)|Cursive]], [[Azure Ray]], [[Tilly and the Wall]] and [[311 (band)|311]]. During the late 1990s, Omaha became nationally known as the birthplace of [[Saddle Creek Records]], and the subsequent &quot;Omaha Sound&quot; was born from their bands' collective style.&lt;ref&gt;Dinova, N.

==About==
The city was named after the creek of the same name which flows through its center. The name Papillion (papillon) is derived from the [[French language|French]] term for [[butterfly]]. According to local tradition the early French explorers named the creek Papillion because many butterflies were found along its grassy banks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usgennet.org/usa/ne/topic/resources/OLLibrary/Maps_Atlas/nebplacenames/placename8.html#sarpy usgennet.org] - Nebraska place names - Sarpy County - accessed 2011-09-08&lt;/ref&gt; The city's seal indicates it was founded in 1870.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.papillion.org/about_papillion.cfm papillion.org] - about - accessed 2011-09-08&lt;/ref&gt; Papillion (sometimes referred to as &quot;Papio&quot; by its residents) is one of the last of the late-18th-Century Paris-inspired frontier cities left in the Midwest. Halleck Park, a recreation area in the heart of the city, includes many trails, open spaces, trees and a number of areas of interest, including [http://www.papiofunpark.com Papio Fun Park], Papio Bay Aquatic Park, Papio Pool, and Papio Bowl. In addition to trails, trees and much green space, inside the park there are tennis courts, volleyball courts, playgrounds, &quot;The Duck Pond&quot;, Monarch Field (&quot;The Pit&quot;), and E.A. Fricke Field.
[[File:Shadow Lake Towne Center.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Shadow Lake Towne Center]]
There are also nine other baseball diamonds within the park for youth.  The baseball diamonds are spread across three fields: Halleck, Blonde, and Papio Bay.  Village Park, Papio Bay Aquatic Center (including two water slides and a zero depth pool) and Walnut Creek recreational park round out just a few of the many parks and recreational interest points of the city. Papillion Junior High School is in the downtown area south of Papio Creek; the building was the high school until August 1971 while the old junior high was directly west, across the street. Also downtown is the Old A.W. Clarke banking house, Sump Memorial Library, City Hall, Portal One-Room School House, Papillion Municipal Building (Sarpy County Courthouse until 1970), and the John Sutter House.

Other areas of interest in Papillion include Sarpy County Court House and Jail, Shadow Lake Towne Center, and Midlands Hospital all along [[Nebraska Highway 370]] in the southern portion of the city.

Papillion is now Nebraska's home of [[Triple-A (baseball)|Triple-A]] [[minor league baseball]]. [[Werner Park]], located less than three miles (5&amp;nbsp;km) west of the city on Highway 370 in unincorporated Sarpy County, opened in 2011 as the new home of the [[Omaha Storm Chasers]] of the [[Pacific Coast League]]. The Storm Chasers were formerly the Omaha Royals; after 42 years at [[Johnny Rosenblatt Stadium|Rosenblatt Stadium]] in south Omaha, the team moved out following the 2010 season and changed their nickname. They have been the only AAA-affiliate of the [[Kansas City Royals]], an [[Expansion team|expansion]] club that entered the [[American League]] in [[1969 Kansas City Royals season|1969]].

==Politics==
[[File:Papillion, Nebraska Municipal Building.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Papillion City Hall]]
Papillion is divided into four wards with two [[councilmember]]s representing each.  One seat for each ward is up for election every two years with each term lasting four years.  The [[mayor]] is the head of the [[city council]] and is elected to four-year terms.  The council meets every two weeks.  Following former Mayor James Blinn's resignation on July 7, 2009, city council president [[David Black]] became mayor of Papillion.  Black was elected for his first full term in 2010.

'''Scottsbluff''' is a city in [[Scotts Bluff County, Nebraska|Scotts Bluff County]], [[Nebraska]], [[United States]]. The population was 15,039 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. Scottsbluff is the largest city in the [[Nebraska Panhandle]], and the [[List of cities in Nebraska|13th largest city]] in [[Nebraska]].

Scottsbluff was founded in 1900 across the [[North Platte River]] from its namesake, a bluff that is now a [[United States National Park|U.S. National Park]] called [[Scotts Bluff National Monument]]. The smaller town of [[Gering, Nebraska|Gering]] had been founded south of the river in 1887. The two cities have since grown together to form the 7th largest urban area ([[Scottsbluff Micropolitan Statistical Area]]) in Nebraska.

The nearby [[Western Nebraska Regional Airport]] (BFF) is the third-busiest airport in Nebraska in terms of passenger boardings.

The '''City of Lincoln''' is the capital and the [[List of cities in Nebraska|second-most populous city]] of the [[U.S. state|State]] of [[Nebraska]], after [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]]. Lincoln is also the [[county seat]] of [[Lancaster County, Nebraska|Lancaster County]] and the home of the [[University of Nebraska–Lincoln|University of Nebraska]]. Lincoln's 2010 Census population was 258,379.

Lincoln was founded in 1856 as the village of '''Lancaster''', and became the county seat of the newly created [[Lancaster County, Nebraska|Lancaster County]] in 1859. The capital of [[Nebraska Territory]] had been Omaha since the creation of the territory in 1854; however, most of the territory's population lived south of the [[Platte River]]. After much of the territory south of the Platte considered annexation to [[Kansas]], the legislature voted to move the capital south of the river and as far west as possible. The village of Lancaster was chosen, in part due to the [[salt flats]] and [[marsh]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nebraska-lincoln.com/history.html |title=Lincoln ne History
 |publisher=Nebraska-lincoln.com |accessdate=July 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Omaha interests attempted to derail the move by having Lancaster renamed after the recently assassinated President [[Abraham Lincoln]]. Many of the people south of the river had been sympathetic to the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] cause in the recently concluded Civil War, and it was assumed that the legislature would not pass the measure if the future capital were named after Abraham Lincoln. The choice to name the capital city &quot;Lincoln&quot; caused quite a stir among the constituents, whose sentiments were mixed regarding who should have won the Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lincoln.org/visiting/whyvisit/history |title=Lincoln Convention and Visitors Bureau &amp;#124; Why Visit Lincoln? &amp;#124; History |publisher=Lincoln.org |accessdate=August 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln topped the [[Center for Disease Control|CDC]] list of healthiest U.S. cities in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/news/20081117/healthiest-us-city-lincoln-neb |title=Healthiest, Unhealthiest U.S. Cities |publisher=Webmd.com |date=2008-11-17 |accessdate=2012-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
[[File:2007 ISS Lincoln, Nebraska 1.jpg|thumb|Photograph of Lincoln taken from the International Space Station (ISS)]]
Lincoln is located at {{Coord|40|48|35|N|96|40|31|W|type:city}} (40.809868, −96.675345).{{GR|1|dateform=mdy}} According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|90.36|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which, {{convert|89.11|sqmi|sqkm|2}} of it is land and {{convert|1.25|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.&lt;ref name =&quot;Gazetteer files&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln is one of the few large cities of Nebraska not located along either the [[Platte River]] or the [[Missouri River]]. The city was originally laid out near [[Salt Creek (Nebraska)|Salt Creek]] and among the nearly flat [[salinity|saline]] [[wetland]]s of northern Lancaster County. The city's growth over the years has led to development of the surrounding land, much of which is composed of gently rolling hills. In recent years, Lincoln's northward growth has encroached on the habitat of the endangered [[Salt Creek tiger beetle]].

===Metropolitan area===
The [[Lincoln, Nebraska metropolitan area|Lincoln metropolitan area]] consists of Lancaster County and [[Seward County, Nebraska|Seward County]], which was added to the metropolitan area in 2003. Lincoln has very little development outside its city limits and has no contiguous suburbs (the largest town that can be considered a suburb of Lincoln is [[Waverly, Nebraska|Waverly]]). This is due primarily to the fact that most land that would otherwise be developed as a suburban town has already been annexed by the city of Lincoln itself.

===Parks===
{{Main|Parks in Lincoln, Nebraska}}

The largest parks in Lincoln's park system are [[Wilderness Park]], [[Pioneers Park (Lincoln, Nebraska)|Pioneers Park]] and [[Pioneers Park Nature Center]], [[Holmes Park]], [[Oak Lake Park]], [[Roper (Max E.) Park|Max E. Roper Park]], [[Tierra/Briarhurst Park|Tierra Park]], [[Antelope Park (Lincoln, Nebraska)|Antelope Park]] (which contains the [[Lincoln Children's Zoo]], the [[Sunken Gardens (Nebraska)|Sunken Gardens]], and the [[Bicentennial Cascade Fountain]]), and [[Mahoney Park]].  The parks are connected by a {{convert|131|mi|km|abbr=on}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lincoln.ne.gov/city/parks/about/index.htm |publisher=Lincoln Parks &amp; Recreation |title= About Lincoln Parks &amp; Recreation |work=Lincoln.ne.gov |date= |accessdate=November 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; system of recreational trails. The [[MoPac Trail]] extends through Lincoln.

===Climate===
Located on the [[Great Plains]] far from the moderating influence of mountains or large bodies of water, Lincoln possesses a highly variable four-season [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Dfa''): winters are cold but relatively dry, summers are hot and occasionally humid. With little precipitation falling during winter, precipitation is concentrated in the warmer months, when thunderstorms frequently roll in, often producing tornadoes. Snow tends to fall in light amounts, though blizzards are possible. Snow cover is not very reliable due to both the low precipitation and the frequent thaws during winter.

The monthly daily average temperature ranges from {{convert|24.6|°F|1}} in January to {{convert|77.6|°F|1}} in July. However, the city is subject both to episodes of bitter cold in winter and heat waves during summer, with 11.4 nights of sub-{{convert|0|°F|0}} lows, 41 days of {{convert|90|°F|0}}+ highs, and 4.6 days of {{convert|100|°F|0}}+ highs.&lt;ref name= NCDC &gt;

==Law and government==
[[File:40 days Lincoln, Nebraska.jpg|thumb|A park in Lincoln, 1942]]
Lincoln has a [[mayor-council]] government. The mayor and a seven-member [[city council]] are selected in [[nonpartisan]] elections. Four members are elected from city council districts; the remaining three members are elected at-large. Lincoln's health, personnel, and planning departments are joint city/county agencies; most city and Lancaster County offices are located in the County/City Building.

Since Lincoln is the state capital, many Nebraska state agencies and offices are located in Lincoln, as are several [[United States Government]] agencies and offices. The Nebraska Air and Army National Guard's Joint Force Headquarters are located in Lincoln.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ne.ng.mil/ArmyGuard/Pages/AboutUs.aspx |title=Nebraska National Guard - About Us |publisher=Nebraska Military Department |accessdate=November 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city lies within the [[Lincoln Public Schools]] school district; the primary law enforcement agency for the city is the [[Lincoln Police Department]]. The [[Lincoln Fire &amp; Rescue Department|Lincoln Fire and Rescue Department]] shoulders the city's fire fighting and ambulatory services while outlying areas of the city are supported by volunteer fire fighting units.

The city's [[public library]] system is [[Lincoln City Libraries]], which has eight branches. Lincoln City Libraries circulates more than three million items per year to the residents of Lincoln and Lancaster County. Lincoln City Libraries is also home to Polley Music Library and the Jane Pope Geske Heritage Room of Nebraska authors.

==Economy==
[[Image:Amigo's Restaurant.JPG|thumb|230px|Amigos Restaurant on N 48th &amp; Leighton in Lincoln, NE]]

Lincoln's economy is fairly typical of a mid-sized American city; most economic activity is derived from service industries. The state government and the [[University of Nebraska-Lincoln]] are both large contributors to the local economy. Other prominent industries in Lincoln include medical, banking, information technology, education, call centers, insurance, and rail and truck transport.

One of the largest employers is the [[Bryan Health System]], which consists of two major hospitals and several large outpatient facilities located across the city.  Healthcare and medical jobs account for a substantial portion of Lincoln's employment: as of 2009, full-time healthcare employees in the city included 9,010 healthcare practitioners in technical occupations, 4,610 workers in healthcare support positions, 780 licensed and vocational nurses, and 150 medical and clinical laboratory technicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegedegreereport.com/cities/lincoln|title=Lincoln Career, Salary &amp; Employment Info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several national business were originally established in Lincoln; these include student lender [[Nelnet]], [[Fort Western Stores]] and [[HobbyTown USA]].  Several regional restaurant chains began in Lincoln, including [[Amigos/Kings Classic]], [[Runza Restaurants]] and [[Valentino's]].

===Top employers===
According to the City's 2012 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lincoln.ne.gov/city/finance/account/pdf/cafr2012.pdf |title=Comprehensive Annual Financial Report Fiscal Year Ended August 31, 2012 |publisher=City of Lincoln, Nebraska |accessdate=November 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the top employers in the city are:

*[[Nebraska State Capitol]]: designed by [[Bertram Goodhue|Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue]] and constructed between 1922 and 1932. The capitol building is a skyscraper topped by a golden dome. The tower is crowned by a 6-meter (20&amp;nbsp;ft) statue of a farmer sowing grain on a pedestal of wheat and corn (sculptor: [[Lee Lawrie]]), to represent the state's agricultural heritage. City zoning rules prevent any other building from rivaling it in height, making it a landmark not only within the city but for the surrounding area. Inside, there are many paintings and iridescent murals depicting the Native American heritage and the history and culture of the early pioneers who settled Nebraska. It is the second tallest U.S. State Capitol building behind the [[Louisiana State Capitol]] building in [[Baton Rouge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=126253 |title=Nebraska State Capitol, Lincoln, U.S.A. |publisher=Emporis.com |accessdate=August 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Beatrice''' ({{IPAc-en|b|iː|ˈ|æ|t|r|ɨ|s}} {{respell|bee|AT|rəss}})&lt;ref name=pronunciation/&gt; is a city in and the [[county seat]] of [[Gage County, Nebraska|Gage County]], [[Nebraska]].

Beatrice is located {{Convert|40|mi}} south of [[Lincoln, Nebraska|Lincoln]] on the [[Big Blue River (Kansas)|Big Blue River]].  It is surrounded by agricultural country.  The population was 12,459 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].

==History==
Gage County was one of the 19 counties originally established by the [[Nebraska Territorial Legislature]] in 1854. At the time of its establishment, there were no settlers living within it.&lt;ref name=survey/&gt;

In 1857, the steamboat ''Hannibal'', carrying 300 passengers up the [[Missouri River]] from [[St. Louis, Missouri]] to [[Nebraska City, Nebraska]], ran aground near [[Kansas City, Missouri]].  While it was stranded, 35 of the passengers agreed to form the &quot;Nebraska Association&quot;, under which name they would unite in seeking a townsite and establishing a settlement in the territory.&lt;ref name=andreas/&gt;&lt;ref name=casde/&gt;

After reaching Nebraska City, the Association divided itself into two exploratory parties, one of which went directly westward and the other southwest. The latter party located the site of Beatrice, at the point where the [[DeRoin Trail]] crossed the [[Big Blue River (Kansas)|Big Blue River]]; and the whole Association decided to settle there. The settlement was named after Julia Beatrice Kinney, the 17-year-old daughter of Judge John F. Kinney, a member of the Association.&lt;ref name=andreas/&gt;&lt;ref name=casde/&gt;&lt;ref name=histofgage/&gt;{{rp|120}}&lt;ref&gt;At least one reference (Jerrold M. Packard, ''Victoria's Daughters'', New York: St. Martins, 1998, p. 62) suggests that it was named for [[Princess Beatrice of the United Kingdom|Beatrice]], last-born child of Queen Victoria (1857-1944).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Territorial Legislature selected Beatrice as the county seat of Gage County in 1857.  The decision was challenged by [[Blue Springs, Nebraska|Blue Springs]], but was confirmed by the Legislature in 1859. In 1864, the Legislature dissolved the original Clay County (not the current [[Clay County, Nebraska]]), dividing its land between Gage and [[Lancaster County, Nebraska|Lancaster]] Counties. The addition of this ground in the north placed Beatrice near the center of the enlarged county, strengthening its claim to the county seat.&lt;ref name=survey/&gt;  It continues to hold that position today.&lt;ref name=aboutgage/&gt;

===Homestead Act===
In 1862, the U.S. Congress passed the [[Homestead Act]], which allowed settlers to claim {{Convert|160|acre}} of government land for a nominal fee. The law went into effect on January 1, 1863.  Just after midnight on that day, [[Daniel Freeman]] persuaded a clerk to open the local Land Office so that he could file a claim for a homestead located {{Convert|4|mi|sigfig=1}} west of Beatrice. His is regarded as the first of the 417 applications filed that day.&lt;ref name=nythomestead/&gt;&lt;ref name=archives/&gt;

In 1936, Congress created [[Homestead National Monument of America]] on the site of Freeman's claim.&lt;ref name=npshomestead/&gt;

===Early development===
The Big Blue River was both a help and a hindrance to the development of Beatrice.  It provided the town with a water source, and produced ample power to operate the mills that were among the town's first industries.&lt;ref name=andreas/&gt;&lt;ref name=casde/&gt;  However, it represented a major obstacle to travelers on the Oregon Trail route;&lt;ref name=survey/&gt; and floods frequently destroyed the dams and bridges in the area. Not until 1890 was a Big Blue bridge built in Beatrice that could survive for decades.&lt;ref name=survey/&gt;&lt;ref name=andreas/&gt;

In 1871, the [[Burlington and Missouri River Railroad]] constructed a line from [[Lincoln, Nebraska]] to Beatrice. In 1879, the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] built a line joining Beatrice to [[Marysville, Kansas]]. By 1890, the [[Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad]] had also run tracks through Beatrice.&lt;ref name=survey/&gt;

===Beatrice State Developmental Center===
In 1885, the Nebraska legislature enacted legislation to establish the Institution for Feeble Minded Youth near Beatrice, subject to the city's donating a suitable parcel of land.&lt;ref name=histofgage/&gt;{{rp|303}}  Beatrice donated 40 acres, located {{convert|2|mi|sigfig=1}} east of the city limits; and the first residents were admitted in 1887.&lt;ref name=feeblenomform/&gt;

Over the following decades, the institution expanded greatly. By 1935, there were 1171 residents living on {{convert|519|acre}}.  The institution was largely self-supporting, operating a farm on which the residents did much of the work; in 1935, {{convert|346|acre}} were under cultivation.&lt;ref name=feeblenomform/&gt;

In 1945, the institution was renamed the Beatrice State Home.&lt;ref name=rename1/&gt; Its resident population peaked at about 2300 in the late 1960s.&lt;ref name=ljshist/&gt;  From there it declined: new restrictions had been imposed on the use of unpaid labor by residents of institutions, and there was a national trend toward [[deinstitutionalization]].&lt;ref name=feeblenomform/&gt;  In 1975, the ''Horacek v. [[J. James Exon|Exon]]'' lawsuit was settled with a consent decree whereunder many of the residents of the Beatrice State Home were transferred to [[Community mental health service|community-based mental health facilities]].&lt;ref name=horacek/&gt;  In that year, the institution's name was changed to the current Beatrice State Developmental Center.&lt;ref name=indictment/&gt;

A 2006 investigation by the federal [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] revealed a number of severe deficiencies at the Center;&lt;ref name=fedmed/&gt; after two years of appeals, the Center lost its [[Medicaid]] certification in 2009.&lt;ref name=medicaid/&gt;

As of 2011, the Center served about 175 clients.&lt;ref name=bsdc/&gt;  The majority have been diagnosed with &quot;severe&quot; or &quot;profound&quot; retardation; nearly all suffer from two or more other disabling conditions.&lt;ref name=bsdc-demo1/&gt;&lt;ref name=bsdc-demo2/&gt;
