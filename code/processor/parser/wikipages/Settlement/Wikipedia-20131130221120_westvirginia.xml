'''Madison''' is a city and former [[coal town]] in [[Boone County, West Virginia|Boone County]], [[West Virginia]], [[United States]]. The population was 3,076 at the 2010 census. It is the [[county seat]] of [[Boone County, West Virginia|Boone County]]{{GR|6}}.

==History==
Madison was first established as '''Boone Court House'''.  The town was renamed about 1865, presumably for [[James Madison]], the fourth president of the United States. Other theories hold that it was named for lawyer James Madison Laidley or for Madison Peyton, a pioneer [[coal]] operator, who was a leader in the movement which resulted in the formation of Boone County and for whom [[Peytona, West Virginia|Peytona]] on [[Big Coal River]] was named. Madison was [[incorporation (municipal government)|incorporated]] in 1906.&lt;ref name=&quot;e-WV&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wvencyclopedia.org/articles/1470|title=The West Virginia Encyclopedia: Madison|date=October 8, 2010|accessdate=2011-07-23 |author= unknown|publisher=West Virginia Humanities Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first courthouse at Madison, a log structure, was burned by Union troops early in the [[American Civil War]]. The second courthouse, made of local brick, served until 1913, and a frame building was used by county officials for the next several years. The present [[Boone County Courthouse (West Virginia)|Boone County Courthouse]], occupied in 1921, is on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nris&quot;&gt;{{NRISref|version=2009a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Madison is the &quot;Gateway to the Coalfields,&quot; as it is located on a principal route through the southern coalfields.  It occupied a strategic place during the [[Battle of Blair Mountain|Mine Wars]]. Miners twice rallied at the town ballpark in August 1921, to consider whether to continue their march to neighboring Logan and Mingo counties. Thousands of armed marchers passed through the town and surrounding region on their way to and from the fighting at Blair Mountain, which is located up Spruce Fork from Madison.&lt;ref name=&quot;e-WV&quot;/&gt;

In addition to the Boone County Courthouse, the [[Madison National Bank]] building is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nris&quot;/&gt;

'''Nitro''' is a city in [[Kanawha County, West Virginia|Kanawha]] and [[Putnam County, West Virginia|Putnam]] counties in the [[U.S. state]] of [[West Virginia]], along the [[Kanawha River]]. The population was 7,178 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. Nitro is a part of the [[Huntington-Ashland, WV-KY-OH, Metropolitan Statistical Area]] (MSA). As of the 2010 census, the MSA had a population of 287,702. New definitions from February 28, 2013 placed the population at 363,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/bulletins/2013/b13-01.pdf|title=Population statistics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nitro was [[incorporation (municipal government)|incorporated]] in 1932 by [[Circuit Court]].

==City name origin==
The name Nitro derives from [[nitrocellulose]].&lt;ref&gt;Wintz, William. Nitro, The World War II Boom Town. South Charleston, WV: Jalamap Publications, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; The Nitro area was to be the American ammunition production facility during [[World War I]]. Its name was selected by the [[United States]] government because of the establishment there, during World War I, of a large federal plant for the manufacture of explosives. The chemical plants in the area were able to fulfill this function during [[World War II]], on a lesser scale. The city is known as the &quot;Magic City,&quot; or a &quot;Living Memorial to World War I.&quot;

==Famous residents==
Famous people with ties to the town:
* [[Major League Baseball]] player [[Lew Burdette]] was born in Nitro in 1926.
* Country singer [[Kathy Mattea]], who grew up in nearby [[Cross Lanes, West Virginia|Cross Lanes]], is a graduate of Nitro High School.
* [[J. R. House]], who played for several MLB teams in the early 2000s, was a record-setting quarterback at Nitro High from 1996 through 1998.
* Actor [[Clark Gable]] lived briefly in Nitro around 1920.

==Education==
The city's public school students do not all attend the same schools, because West Virginia school districts are divided strictly along county lines, without regard to city boundaries.

Kanawha County residents are served by the following schools in the city:
* Nitro Elementary School (public)
* Nitro High School (public)

There is no public middle school in Nitro on either side of the county line, nor is there any public school within the Putnam County portion of the city. Middle school students in Kanawha County must bus to Andrew Jackson Middle School in Cross Lanes. Putnam County students must bus to Rock Branch Elementary, Poca Middle, and Poca High.

==Environment==
The reach of the Kanawha River Valley between Belle and Nitro is known locally as the “Chemical Valley,” which, at its peak in the late 1950s and early 1960s, was the leading producer of chemicals in the world (Henry, 1974).  During World War I the government built an $80 million complex in Nitro to manufacture explosives and chemicals for the war effort.

The site was located on an {{convert|1800|acre|km2|sing=on}} cow pasture on the Kanawha River on the flat river valley floodplain.  The facility had just been placed in operation when the war ended in November 1918.  The first shipment of powder was also the last.  Local authorities then sought various chemical companies to occupy the facility which had excellent infrastructure in utilities, transportation and new housing for workers.  It was hoped that the former gunpowder complex would become a major chemical manufacturing center, especially for the emerging dye industry in the U.S. that relied on coal and coke by-products as feedstock.

The Kanawha River and water in the adjacent alluvium have been adversely affected by industrial activities (Messinger, 1997).&lt;ref&gt;http://pubs.usgs.gov/wri/wri004020/pdf/wri00-4020.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The chemical manufacturing history of Nitro resulted in environmental impairment, including the Fike/Artel Chemical Site (EPA ID: WVD047989207), which is on the National Priorities List [[Superfund (environmental law)|Superfund]].  The {{convert|12|acre|m2|adj=on}} site was placed on the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] National Priorities List in 1983.  The site is a former World War I chemical munitions plant at which subsequent chemical manufacturing, reclamation and disposal was allegedly conducted.

The Solutia Inc. Nitro Plant, located on the east bank of the Kanawha River approximately one-half mile north of the City of Nitro in Putnam County, is being investigated through the [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act|RCRA]] program.  From 1918 to 1921, the facility manufactured explosives including “nitro-powder” to support World War I. When explosives manufacturing processes ceased, the facility was purchased and used for a variety of industries. RCRA Corrective Action activities at this facility are being conducted under the direction of EPA Region 3 and the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection.&lt;ref&gt;Region 3 GPRA Baseline RCRA Corrective Action Facility, http://www.epa.gov/reg3wcmd/ca/wv/pdf/wvd039990965.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Other RCRA Corrective Action facilities include Great Lakes Chemicals Company (formerly FMC Corporation) &lt;ref&gt;Region 3 GRPA Baseline RCRA Corrective Action Facility, http://www.epa.gov/reg3wcmd/ca/wv/pdf/wvd005005087.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and Union Carbide Corp. - PTO (a subsidiary of The Dow Chemical Company).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/reg3wcmd/ca/wv/pdf/wvd000739722.pdf Microsoft Word - wvd000739722.doc&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to manufacturing activities, Nitro becoming known was for a distinctive chemical smell—especially in the area of the I-64 bridge.  However, the recent shift away from manufacturing in the region has significantly reduced air pollution issues.

==Scientific Research Activities==

In 2001 [[Clonaid]] operated a lab in Nitro that was tied to the [[Raelians]]. It was located inside a rented room within a former high school.  The FDA said that the equipment in lab was state-of-the-art and had been bought by a former West Virginia state legislator Mark Hunt.

==Recreation==
Nitro is home to Ridenour Lake, a {{convert|27|acre|m2|adj=on}} impoundment located in the City of Nitro’s Ridenour Park ({{convert|43|acre|m2}}). The area near the lake was the scene of an alleged February 18, 1967 [[Mothman]] sighting, although this remains unconfirmed. Nitro is home to several antique and primitive shops. The antique shops throughout the city are a great attraction for visitors of collectibles from all over the country.

Robert C. Byrd Boat Launch - The Robert C. Byrd Boat Launch, a $400,000 facility, opened in September 2012, after a decade-long effort to transform the landfill into a public use space. The West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) recognized the city and FMC Corp. with an award for environmental excellence on May 25, 2012 in Charleston.

[http://www.legis.state.wv.us/Educational/publications/pub.cfm Published annually] by the Clerk's Office of the [[West Virginia Senate]].&lt;/ref&gt; Dunbar was a farming community until industries began to evolve in the City with the opening of glass and bottling plants in 1912. The Gravely Plow was invented in Dunbar in 1916.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;www.cityofdunbarwv.com&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mullens''' is a city in [[Wyoming County, West Virginia|Wyoming County]], [[West Virginia]]. The population was 1,559 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].  

Located in a valley along the [[Guyandotte River]] within a mountainous region of southern West Virginia, the town was nearly destroyed by flash flooding in July 2001. While the town has attempted to redevelop with the aid of state and federal recovery money, many local businesses and residents have left the area permanently. Organizations like the Mullens-based [[Rural Appalachian Improvement League]] are working to improve conditions across the region. Mullens is also the hometown of current [[Los Angeles Lakers]] head coach [[Mike D'Antoni]].

== History ==
Mullens was [[incorporation (municipal government)|incorporated]] as a town on September 17, 1912 and operated under a charter issued by the [[Circuit Court]] of Wyoming County. It was named for A. J. Mullins, who owned the land upon which the town is built. The towns original name was spelled with an &quot;i&quot; but when A.J. didn't dot his &quot;i&quot; on a paper it looked as though he signed an &quot;e&quot;. An Act of the [[West Virginia Legislature]] granting a charter to the City of Mullens was passed February 22, 1929.

The early growth of the Mullens community came with development of the lumber and coal mining industries. In the early 20th century, coal-mining manager and developer [[William Nelson Page]] of [[Ansted, West Virginia|Ansted]] helped open the [[Winding Gulf Coalfield]] with plans for the [[Deepwater Railway]], a new [[short-line railroad]]. When Page ran into competitive collusion by the bigger railroads which would have wrecked his project, backed by his silent partner, wealthy industrialist [[Henry H. Rogers|Henry Huttleston Rogers]], the plan was expanded in a secretive and massive way to build a line all the way east to the port of [[Hampton Roads]]. 

Completed in 1909, the [[Virginian Railway]] (VGN) established engine terminal and yard facilities near Mullens which employed hundreds of workers during the first half of the 20th century. The VGN was merged with the [[Norfolk and Western Railway]] (N&amp;W) in 1959, and both later became part of the [[Norfolk Southern Railway]] (NS). A caboose museum in Mullens celebrates the history of the railroad in the region.

The [[Mullens Historic District]] was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1993.&lt;ref name=&quot;nris&quot;&gt;{{NRISref|version=2009a}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The nearby [[Wyco Church]] was listed in 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;nps&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/nr/listings/20100409.htm|title=National Register of Historic Places Listings|date=2010-04-09|work=Weekly List of Actions Taken on Properties: 3/29/10 through 4/02/10|publisher=National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Tucker County Courthouse.JPG|thumb|320px|right|[[Tucker County Courthouse and Jail|Tucker County Courthouse]], '''Parsons, West Virginia''']]
The town of '''Parsons''' is the [[county seat]]{{GR|6}} of [[Tucker County, West Virginia|Tucker County]], [[West Virginia]], in the United States. The population was 1,485 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. The mayor of Parsons is Dorothy Judy and the city administrator is Jason Myers. The town is also governed by a city council.

==History==
Parsons was created in the heart of Tucker County. The town was named for Ward Parsons, described by one source as having once owned the land on which the town was built, and by another as having been an aged wilderness pioneer in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Kenny, Hamill |title= West Virginia Place Names: Their Origin and Meaning, Including the Nomenclature of the Streams and Mountains |year=1945 |publisher=The Place Name Press |location=Piedmont, West Virginia |pages= 475}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[West Virginia Central and Pittsburg Railway]] was built into Parsons in 1888. The railway caused the town to boom by the 1890s. The railway was later merged into the [[Western Maryland Railway]] and provided passenger train service until the 1950s.

===County seat dispute===
In 1889, 1890 and 1892, Ward Parsons and other residents petitioned to have the county seat moved from nearby [[St. George, West Virginia|St. George]] to Parsons. All attempts failed to gather the necessary 60 percent majority rule. In 1893, the 60 percent was achieved and Parsons collected its title as the new county seat. It was also incorporated in that year.&lt;ref name=wvencyc&gt;[http://www.wvencyclopedia.org/articles/1814 West Virginia Encyclopedia: &quot;Parsons.&quot;] West Virginia Humanities Council, Charleston, WV. Accessed 2013-07-28.&lt;/ref&gt; However, prominent citizens of St. George protested the vote, claiming irregularities in the voting. When the court overruled the claim, Adam C. Minear and William M. Cayton took their case to the state government.

Ward and citizens of Parsons eventually became frustrated with the government and took it upon themselves to march into the St. George courthouse and steal the courthouse records for their own. Their attempt was successful; they even stole the bell from their clock tower. Parsons citizens marched back to the town and kept the city records and the bell in a small store until a permanent courthouse was constructed in 1900.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;&gt;[http://www.polsci.wvu.edu/wv/Tucker/tuchistory.html Early History of Tucker County]&lt;/ref&gt;

===1985 flood===
The [[Cheat River#1985 flood|1985 Cheat River flood]] caused extensive damage in Parsons. Over 90 percent of the businesses and hundreds of homes were damaged or destroyed.&lt;ref name=wvencyc/&gt;

'''Keystone''' is a town in [[McDowell County, West Virginia|McDowell County]], [[West Virginia]], [[United States]]. The population was 282 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].  Keystone is one of several incorporated towns in West Virginia with an African-American majority, with 72 percent of the residents being black.

Larry Scott Deaner wrote about the historical geography of the African-American population of Keystone in his 2004 Master's thesis.  Deaner calls Keystone the cultural capital of the &quot;Free State of McDowell&quot; - a term coined by Matthew Thomas Whittico, a local newspaper editor and community leader from Keystone in the early 20th century.  Keystone possessed a unique combination of political, social, and economic characteristics that made it an attractive place for African-Americans to migrate to in the late 1800s and early 1900s.&lt;ref&gt;Deaner, Larry Scott (2004). ''Home in the McDowell County Coalfields: The African-American Population of Keystone, West Virginia'' (M.A., Geography thesis). Ohio University.&lt;/ref&gt;

Keystone was founded in 1892 by the Keystone Coal &amp; Coke Company. Keystone was then [[incorporation (municipal government)|incorporated]] in 1909 by the [[Circuit Court]] of McDowell County. Its name is derived from the name of a [[coal]] and [[coke (fuel)|coke]] company operating at that point. The town was formerly known as '''Cassville'''.

[[Denise Giardina]] modeled the fictional town of Annadel in her novel ''Storming Heaven'' after Keystone.&lt;ref&gt;C. Stuart McGehee (2010). &quot;Keystone&quot;. e-WV: The West Virginia Encyclpedia. http://www.wvencyclopedia.org/articles/1200&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The town was laid out in 1790, and its post office was opened on September 1, 1870.

In 1772, the Cox brothers, Friend, Israel, and Jonathan, made [[tomahawk rights]] claims totaling {{convert|1,200|acre|km2}} in the area now including Wellsburg. In March 1788, Charles Prather purchased {{convert|481|acre|km2}} from the Cox heirs for $3,000. In 1791, Prather petitioned Ohio County to incorporate the town of Charlestown, Virginia, naming it after himself. The original name continued until 1816, when it was changed to Wellsburg, to avoid confusion with [[Charles Town, West Virginia|Charles Town, Jefferson County]]. The new name was in honor of Charles Wells (1745-1815), Charles Prather’s son-in-law, builder of the first large flour warehouse in the east. Late in 1890, nearby Midway and Lazearville were annexed to Wellsburg.&lt;ref name=&quot;e-WV&quot;/&gt;

Wellsburg was the home of [[Patrick Gass]], the last surviving member of the Lewis and Clark expedition and author of a memoir of the famous journey. Here also was the home of Joseph Doddridge, author of ''Notes on the Settlement and Indian Wars''. In 1832, the original [[Grimes Golden]] apple tree was found just east of Wellsburg. The first glass factory in Western Virginia was built at Wellsburg in 1813.&lt;ref name=&quot;e-WV&quot;/&gt;

Wellsburg has a [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Brooke County, West Virginia|number of entries]] on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].  The most notable are [[Miller's Tavern]] and [[Wellsburg Wharf]].  The [[Wellsburg Historic District]] was listed in 1982.&lt;ref name=&quot;nris&quot;&gt;{{NRISref|version=2010a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{unreferenced|section|date=October 2013}}
Samuel Cockayne (1768–1854) migrated from the east and settled on the land that now comprises Glen Dale in 1798. The Cockayne family operated a large farm, which was inherited by Samuel's sons, Benjamin Bennett Cockayne (1805–1875) and Vincent Lowe Cockayne (1807–1886), on his death in 1854. Benjamin Bennett Cockayne, known by Bennett, built the farmhouse in 1850.

Ownership of the farmhouse and the surrounding farmland passed down through the direct bloodline of Bennett Cockayne, who married Sarah Price (1809–1884) in 1826. Samuel Andrew Jackson Cockayne (1841–1904), son of Bennett and Sarah (Price) Cockayne, was the next member of the family to inherit the farm. Samuel Andrew Jackson Cockayne married Hannah Jane Alexander (1840–1917) in 1863. Samuel A. J. Cockayne raised American Merino sheep on the farm during his tenure as owner and made it internationally known for its production of Merino wool. Hannah Jane (Alexander) Cockayne gave the name &quot;Glen Dale Farm&quot; to the Cockayne Farmstead, and it is from the name of the farm that the city of Glen Dale derived its name.

Samuel Alexander Cockayne (1874–1953), son of Samuel A. J. Cockayne and Hannah Jane (Alexander) Cockayne, inherited the farm on his mother's death in 1917. He married Beulah Smith (1881–1945) in 1919, and they had two sons - Samuel Andrew Jackson Cockayne (1921–2001) and John Bennett Cockayne (1923–1996). Ownership of the farmstead passed to Samuel A. J. Cockayne on his father's death in 1953. Samuel A. J. Cockayne, who served in the South Pacific with the US Army during World War II, continued to farm the land until 1967 when most of the farmland was sold for the construction of nearby John Marshall High School. Samuel A. J. Cockayne lived the rest of his life unmarried in the farmhouse until his death in 2001. In his will, he bequeathed the farmhouse and its contents to the City of Glen Dale. The city leased the property to the Marshall County Historical Society, who undertook a major restoration project in an effort to preserve the farmhouse, its contents and the remaining land that comprises the farmstead.

The toy company [[Louis Marx and Company|Marx]], was in Glen Dale from 1934 until 1979.

'''Ronceverte''' is a city in [[Greenbrier County, West Virginia|Greenbrier County]], [[West Virginia]], on the [[Greenbrier River]]. The population was 1,765 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].

== Culture and History ==
Ronceverte might have been named Edgar, for the high number of Edgars who lived in the town, but the name was settled by a leading [[entrepreneur]] of the area, Cecil Clay, president of the [[St. Lawrence Boom and Manufacturing Company]].  According to Clay, he saw the name on an old [[Jesuit]] map from [[Fort Duquesne]].  His argument was the name &quot;looked well in print and was [[euphonious]] in sound.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Ronceverte--Name Chosen For Our Town&quot;--Riders of the Flood Historic Newsletter, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;
As the owner of the town's site, Clay argued he had the right to decide on the name, but the residents could change the name to whatever they wanted once Ronceverte was fully established.  That day has never happened.  Since April 1, 1882, the town has been Ronceverte.

Ronceverte is [[French language|French]] for &quot;Bramble Green&quot; which is the [[Gauls|Gallic]] equivalent for &quot;[[Greenbrier]]&quot;.  The Greenbriers are a common [[vine]] ([[Smilax rotundifolia]]) and a humorous myth has it the [[Surveying|surveyors]] were trapped in a thicket of the painful vines when they discovered the [[Greenbrier River]].  French surveyors were likely the first [[cartographers]] for the area, although many of the details have been lost to history.

The river is still inseparable from the culture of the town itself, considered one of the earliest significant [[river port]]s in the [[Greenbrier River]] [[Drainage basin|watershed]].[http://www.greenbrierriver.org]

The [[Hokes Mill Covered Bridge]] was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1981.  The [[Ronceverte Historic District]] was listed in 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;nris&quot;&gt;{{NRISref|version=2010a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Railroad ==
Ronceverte is a proud railroad town, a part of the [[Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad|C&amp;O]] tracklines that connected [[Pocahontas County, West Virginia|Pocahontas County]] to [[Hinton (Amtrak station)|Hinton]], and to [[Clifton Forge]], [[Virginia]].  Ronceverte was part of the &quot;Gravel Girtie&quot; line where Hinton-based train cars were sent to the [[limestone]] [[quarry]] at [[Fort Spring]] and loaded with crushed lime.  This cargo was sent to Clifton Forge where it fluxed in the large furnaces.

During [[World War II]] the tracklines carried [[Germans|German]] [[Prisoners of War]] to areas like local farms and projects.  One of the [[Train station|depots]] for the area, the Rockland Depot, has been lost to history and only the name of Rockland Road in Ronceverte remains.

== Geography ==
Ronceverte is located at {{coord|37|44|54|N|80|28|12|W|type:city}} (37.748460, -80.469910).{{GR|1}}

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|1.73|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which, {{convert|1.70|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.03|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.&lt;ref name =&quot;Gazetteer files&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2013-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Demographics ==
Ronceverte's economic area is in the downtown section, crossed with railroad tracks for the [[Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad|Chesapeake &amp; Ohio]] and a large floodplain that causes occasional adjustment for its citizens.  Grants from [[Tony Hawk]] and the [[Izaak Walton League]] have allowed this public area to grow for the health and recreational opportunities for its citizens.  A ball field, swimming pool, playground, interpretive walk and walking track appeal to all ages adjacent to a public access point of the [[Greenbrier River]], where picnickers are welcome.  The county's recycling depot is close by, encouraging further business from a large area.  The public access includes a boat launch for swimmers and fishers, and an outdoor [[amphitheater]].  Every June this area is inundated with the Ronceverte River Festival, where a unique raffle is held by floating hundreds of small, numbered yellow ducks into the river.  The winning duck can be a cash prize or a new truck; runners-up are gifts from local businesses to support county interests.

==Theater and Drama==
In the late 1880s, a man was traveling through on the rail and saw a very pretty young woman at the Ronceverte Depot.  The incident inspired a song, &quot;The Pretty Girl of Ronceverte&quot; written by Thomas Thackston and set to music by Charles Pratt.  The music is on display at the Ronceverte Public Library.[http://ronceverte.lib.wv.us/]

In September 10–19 the Outdoor Amphitheater holds Riders of the Flood, a popular [[historical drama]] play based on the book by [[Pocahontas County, West Virginia|Pocahontas County]] author [[W. E. Blackhurst]] for the Riders of the Flood Outdoor Drama.&lt;ref&gt;http://ridersoftheflood.com/&lt;/ref&gt; The play's theme is a demonstration of Ronceverte's importance in the turn of the 20th century, when its [[St. Lawrence Boom and Lumber Company]] was the largest [[softwood]] mill in the country,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lewisburg.org/history/stlawrence.htm St. Lawrence Boom and Lumber Co.]&lt;/ref&gt; and traces of its industry have sculpted Ronceverte's portion of the [[Greenbrier River]] to the shape it is today. All proceeds from the play are recycled back into the town of Ronceverte with the intention of improving the community, uplifting its economy, and fostering civic pride. Riders of the Flood is a member of West Virginia's Institute for Outdoor Drama.&lt;ref&gt;http://outdoordrama.unc.edu/directory/by-state/West%20Virginia&lt;/ref&gt; At this point, it is a purely volunteer program as is its sequel, &quot;Big Dreams, Restless Spirit.&quot;

'''Bridgeport''' is a city in [[Harrison County, West Virginia|Harrison County]], [[West Virginia]], [[United States]]. The population was 8,149 at the 2010 census.

The town of Bridgeport had its beginning in pre-[[American Revolutionary War]] times. In 1764, John Simpson entered the area and gave his name to Simpson Creek. Bridgeport was chartered in 1816. When the town was incorporated in 1887, it established the office of mayor and town council. The city currently employs a [[City manager|City Manager]]. Bridgeport is home to Meadowbrook Mall, a 100-store regional shopping complex serving [[North-Central West Virginia]].

==History==
When John Simpson entered the Bridgeport area in 1764, he was attracted by the plentiful supply of fur-bearing animals. The men to follow him were also trappers and the fur trade was the first business in what is now Bridgeport. As the settlers came and cleared land, timber was sold, and the lumber trade became another area business.

The first mill of which there is official record is the Bridgeport or Johnson Mill, which Harvey W. Harmer describes as the first mill in Bridgeport in his Old Grist Mills of Harrison County. This [[gristmill]] was constructed by James Anderson sometime between 1771 and 1787 on Simpson Creek.

In the 19th century, farming was the main livelihood, and the stores in town were mostly general stores designed to serve the area farmers. The town also had a blacksmith and a barber (a man born in slavery), several mills, and two hotels. The [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] ran through Bridgeport beginning in 1856, eliminating the need for area cattleman to drive their livestock all the way to Baltimore. They instead drove their herds into Bridgeport to the stock pens at the railroad depot. The stockyards remained until the early 1980s when it was raised and replaced by Rite Aid. Cattle, sheep, hogs, and even turkeys were driven into Bridgeport from area farms to be sold here or driven on to market. 

The Bridgeport Lamp Chimney Company was succeeded by the Master Glass Company. The Master Glass Company, a marble factory, moved to Bridgeport in 1941 and in 1950 took over the assets of the Akro-Agate Marble Company of [[Clarksburg, WV|Clarksburg]]. The company manufactured &quot;glass balls for industrial use, colored signal lenses, toy marbles, glass ball reflectors used in highway signs and guard rail posts, and other products for various industrial uses.&quot; The company ceased operations in 1973, and the City of Bridgeport bought the property. The building has been torn down, and the former site of the tannery, lamp chimney factory, and marble factory is now a parking lot for the Benedum Civic Center.

On June 29, 2006, the city became noted as the site of a showdown over the issue of [[separation of church and state in the United States]].  A portrait of [[Jesus]] originally hung on a wall at [[Bridgeport High School (West Virginia)|Bridgeport High School]].  Two parents filed suit in [[United States federal courts|federal court]] to have the portrait removed, after the Harrison County Board of Education deadlocked over whether to remove the portrait.[http://www.wdtv.com/viewstory.html?name=2196027]  The portrait of Jesus was stolen from Bridgeport High School early in the morning on August 17, 2006 and a mirror was put in its place.

==History==
[[File:Salemfire2006.jpg|thumb|right|Salem Fire 2006.]]
Salem was settled by [[Seventh Day Baptists]] (the Davis and Randolph families among them).

Salem has a history of large fires. The same full city block has burned down twice in the city's history. The north side of Main Street downtown burned once in 1901 and again on March 2, 2006.  The more recent fire burned the old city bank building, several store fronts, and several residences; five structures in all were damaged. The fire was determined to have been started by a hot water tank in an apartment. The fire departments' ability to put out the blaze was hampered by a limited city water supply; they were forced to draw water from the nearby creek.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wowktv.com/slideshow.cfm?func=viewshow&amp;start=19&amp;maxrows=1&amp;showid=49]  WOWK-TV&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Welch''' is a city located in [[McDowell County, West Virginia|McDowell County]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[West Virginia]]. The population was 2,406 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. Incorporated as a city in 1893, it is the [[county seat]] of McDowell County.{{GR|6}}

==History==

Welch was incorporated in 1893 and named after [[Isaiah A. Welch]], a former captain in the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate Army]] who came to the region as a surveyor, and helped establish the plan for the beginning of a new town at the confluence of the Tug and Elkhorn rivers.

Welch was made the county seat of McDowell County in an election by county citizens in 1892 [http://www.polsci.wvu.edu/wv/McDowell/mcdhistory.html] even before Welch was incorporated as a city. The previous county seat was in Perryville (now [[English, West Virginia|English]]) near present day Coalwood. Results of the election were contested so to avoid violence county records were secretly moved from Perryville to Welch at night in two wagons by James A. Strother and Trigg Tabor.

On March 2, 1921, the Welch City Council met to discuss impeachment of then Mayor J. H. Whitt. Whitt showed up at the meeting and disrupted the proceedings. The Welch City Council then asked the McDowell Co. Sheriff's Dept. to investigate Whitt. Later that same day, Mayor Whitt shot and killed McDowell County Deputy Sheriff William Johnson Tabor who was investigating the matter. Mayor Whitt was arrested and charged with murder but won acquittal at his trial (allegedly based on perjured testimony). Whitt left the area for parts unknown on September 27, 1921.
[[File:Saturday afternoon street scene. Welch, McDowell County, West Virginia. - NARA - 541004.jpg|thumb|left|Saturday afternoon in Welch (1946)]]
On August 1, 1921, detectives from the [[Baldwin-Felts]] agency assassinated Matewan Police Chief [[Sid Hatfield]] as well as Ed Chambers at the McDowell County Courthouse located in Welch. [http://www.matewan.com/History/battle2.htm]

In the first half of the 20th century during the opening of railroads and coal mines throughout the region, Welch became a prosperous city: the hub of retail business for a county approaching 100,000 in population, and the location for three hospitals. After the production boom of World War II, oil began to supplant coal in many areas of domestic fuel supply. Mechanization of coal mining reduced the number of laborers needed in coal production. McDowell County's population peaked in 1950, and began a decline over decades to follow. In 1960, however, McDowell County still ranked number one in the United States in total coal production. The City of Welch proudly proclaimed itself &quot;The Heart of the Nation's Coal Bin.&quot;

When presidential candidate [[John F. Kennedy]] visited Welch by automobile caravan in 1960, he saw a city whose businesses were struggling due to a growing poverty rate throughout the county. What Kennedy learned here during his campaign for the 1960 West Virginia primary was believed to be the basis of the aid brought to the [[Appalachia]]n region by the Kennedy and [[Lyndon Johnson]] administrations. During a speech in Canton, Ohio on September 27, 1960, he stated &quot;McDowell County mines more coal than it ever has in its history, probably more coal than any county in the United States and yet there are more people getting surplus food packages in McDowell County than any county in the United States. The reason is that machines are doing the jobs of men, and we have not been able to find jobs for those men.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;The American Presidency Project http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=74231&lt;/ref&gt;

The first recipients of modern era [[food stamps]] were the Chloe and Alderson Muncy family of Paynesville, McDowell County. Their household included fifteen persons. On May 29, 1961, in the City of Welch, as a crowd of reporters witnessed the proceedings, [[Secretary of Agriculture]] [[Orville Freeman]] delivered $95 of federal food stamps to Mr. and Mrs. Muncy. This was the first issuance of federal food stamps under the Kennedy Administration, and it was the beginning of a rapidly expanding program of federal assistance that would be legislated in the &quot;War on Poverty.&quot;

In the 1960s and 1970s, McDowell County coal continued to be a major source of fuel for the steel and electric power generation industries. As United States steel production declined, however, McDowell County suffered further losses. In 1986, the closure of the US Steel mines in nearby Gary, led to an immediate loss of more than 1,200 jobs. In the following year alone, personal income in McDowell County decreased dramatically by two-thirds. Real estate values also plummeted. Miners were forced to abandon their homes in search for new beginnings in other regions of the country.

In recent years, Welch has attracted the construction of new state and federal prisons which are creating some sources of economic renewal. The city has begun restoration of its historic downtown area.

Welch has been the celebrated location of an annual Veteran's Day Parade which over the decades has attracted a distinguished list of speakers, including Harry Truman and Lyndon Johnson.

The [[McDowell County Courthouse (Welch, West Virginia)|McDowell County Courthouse]] and [[Welch Commercial Historic District]] are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nris&quot;&gt;{{NRISref|version=2010a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Firsts==

Welch was the location of the first memorial building in the [[United States]] dedicated to the memory of Americans who gave their lives for their country in [[World War I]], and to honor the veterans of that war. It was dedicated on May 30, 1923.  The building was destroyed by fire.  The historic site is now an empty lot near the county courthouse.

In 1928, Welch resident Minnie Buckingham Harper became the first black woman legislator in the United States. Harper was appointed by the Governor to the [[West Virginia House of Delegates]] to fill the vacancy caused by the death of her husband.

Welch also built the first municipally owned [[Multi-storey car park|parking building]] in the United States, which was opened September 1, 1941. It accommodated 232 cars and showed a profit its first year in operation.

==Geography==
Welch is located at {{coord|37|26|14|N|81|34|44|W|type:city}} (37.437323, −81.579002){{GR|1}}.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|6.04|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which, {{convert|6.01|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.03|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.&lt;ref name =&quot;Gazetteer files&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2013-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Periodic [[flood]]ing of the [[Elkhorn River (West Virginia)|Elkhorn]] and [[Tug Fork River|Tug Fork]] rivers have plagued the future prosperity of the city. Most notably, the record flooding in 2001 and 2002 nearly destroyed Welch altogether. Flood reduction projects to prevent further destruction in the future are presently in progress.

==History==
[[Freewill Baptist]] founded Ceredo to demonstrate the superiority of an economic system not based on [[slavery|slave]] labor. [[Eli Thayer]], an abolitionist congressman from [[Massachusetts]], believed that bringing abolitionists like himself into southern states could ultimately bring about the end of slavery. While some welcomed the newcomers, several area newspapers published opinions against this &quot;invasion.&quot; The newspaper of nearby [[Ashland, Kentucky]], however, supported this move. By 1857, the city was fully established with a newspaper of its own and several industries.

With [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown's]] raid at [[Guyandotte, West Virginia|Guyandotte]] in 1859 and the outbreak of the [[Civil War (United States)|Civil War]] in 1861, the situation for this abolitionist colony appeared bleak. Its purpose to bring about the peaceful end of slavery over, several residents volunteered for pro-Union regiments.

The [[Z. D. Ramsdell House]] was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1983.&lt;ref name=&quot;nris&quot;&gt;{{NRISref|version=2009a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city is protected by a [[floodwall]], completed by the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] in 1991&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor= Ken Sullivan (ed.) | title= The West Virginia Encyclopedia |year= 2006 |publisher= West Virginia Humanities Council |location=Charleston, W.Va. |isbn= 0-9778498-0-5 |pages= 798 |chapter=Williamson}}&lt;/ref&gt; in response to a devastating [[flood]] along the Tug Fork River in 1977. The wall incorporates [[floodgate]]s along major  access points which, when locked, form a solid barrier against floodwaters. There have only been two uses of the gates thus far: the first occurring in 2002 during a major flood in the region, and the second occurring in 2003, when only two lower lying gates were closed in anticipation of rising water levels.

The local economy is largely fueled by coal mining, transportation, health care and retail.

==History==
[[Image:Coalhouse-williamsonwv2.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The [[Coal House (Williamson, West Virginia)|Coal House]] in Williamson, West Virginia]]
Williamson was incorporated in 1892. Most historians believe that Williamson was named in honor of [[Wallace J. Williamson]]. He owned the land where Williamson now stands, earned a fortune in real estate investments in the area, and founded the city's first bank and its first hotel. Others claim that the city was named for Wallace's father, [[Benjamin F. Williamson]]. He owned most of the land in the region before dividing it among his sons.

Williamson grew rapidly once the railroad connected into the town. Its population, just 688 in 1900, jumped to 6,819 in 1920 and 9,410 in 1930.

'''Benwood''' is a city in [[Marshall County, West Virginia|Marshall County]], [[West Virginia]], along the [[Ohio River]]. It is part of the [[Wheeling, West Virginia]] [[Wheeling metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]]. The population was 1,420 at the 2010 census.

Benwood was chartered in 1853 and incorporated in 1895.  The name of the city is derived from &quot;Ben's Woods&quot;, as Benjamin McMechen (1777 - 1855) inherited that portion of land from the estate of his father, William McMechen (1724 - 1797), and built his homestead upon it.  The neighboring city of [[McMechen, West Virginia|McMechen]] is named after William McMechen and his family, who were among the earliest settlers of this area.

==Neighborhoods==
Benwood is partitioned into 4 sections ('''North Benwood''', '''Center Benwood''', '''South Benwood''' and '''Boggs Run''') each connected by either Marshall Street or [[West Virginia Route 2]].

'''North Benwood'''

North Benwood is the primary commercial area of the small city and contains a small shopping plaza, a grocery store, a gas station and several other small businesses and fast food restaurants. While all of Benwood lies in a flood zone, North Benwood tends to be hit hardest by the floods of the Ohio River.

'''Center Benwood'''

Slightly to the south lies Center Benwood, which is the primary residential section of the city and contains Saint John Roman Catholic Church (established in 1875), Saint James and Saint John School, Benwood City Park (established in 1973), the Fourth Street Playground, the city building, the fire, water and police departments, the post office, the Blake Brothers Post No. 46 American Legion and the original Undo's Family Restaurant.  Center Benwood is laid out in a rectangular grid, approximately 1 mile around divided 4 blocks long and 3 streets wide.  Center Benwood used to be hit very hard by the devastating floods of the Ohio River, but a flood wall was constructed along Water Street (the street that runs along the banks of the Ohio River) in 1982, thus protecting that section of Benwood from the river floods seen in the last three decades (1990, 1991, 1996, 2004, 2005 and 2011).

'''South Benwood'''

South Benwood lies below Center Benwood and contains the majority of the city's industrial developments.

'''Boggs Run'''

The Boggs Run area of Benwood contains the land extending from Marshall Street at the mouth of Boggs Run to Browns Run.  That portion of land was annexed to the city of Benwood on November 7, 1944.  Boggs Run (the creek that runs through the land) is named after John Boggs (1738 - 1826), who staked his claim to the land surrounding the creek in 1774 and settled there with his family along the creek.  In 1798, he sold the land at Boggs Run and moved with most of his family to Pickaway County, Ohio where he lived the remainder of his life.  He is buried in the Boggs Family Cemetery (Elmwood Farm) in Logan Elm Village, Pickaway County, Ohio.

Boggs Run has seen many devastating flash floods through the years, but one of the worst in recent history occurred August 31 - September 1, 1975.  Two other significant flash floods in the 20th Century occurred June 14, 1990 and September 17, 2004.  In the event of an Ohio River Flood, the mouth of Boggs Run is flooded both by the river and the creek, as the river flood backs up the flow of the creek.

'''Outlying Areas'''

While the areas of Benwood Hill and a portion of Boggs Run beyond where Browns Run flows into Boggs Run are provided with some services from Benwood's public works, they fall outside the city limits and are not directly parts of the city.

'''Former Neighborhoods'''

Harmony Hill was a residential area of Benwood that was located on the hillside between the mouth of Boggs Run and Schad's Crossing (former entrance to the north end of Center Benwood at Fourth Street) along West Virginia Route 2.  Kentucky Heights was another residential area located on the hillside along Route 2 between Schad's Crossing at Center Benwood and The [[Bellaire Bridge]].  The homes and businesses of both areas were all razed to make way for the relocation of West Virginia Route 2 through the construction of the present four-lane highway in 1966.

==Religion==
Benwood was once home to three churches of different religious denominations.  Of the three churches, two remain in operation.

'''Saint John Roman Catholic Church'''

Saint John Roman Catholic Church, located on Main Street in Center Benwood, was officially established as a parish on August 1, 1875 when the first resident pastor, Rev. Patrick F. McKernan, was appointed to serve the people of Benwood.  In 1868, a church had been constructed by Roman Catholics in Benwood dedicated to [[John the Apostle|Saint John the Apostle and Evangelist]] and had been served by visiting priests from parishes in the surrounding area prior to 1875.  The original church was destroyed in the Ohio River Flood of 1884.  The present church was built on the site of the original church in 1891.

The majority of the parish consists of the descendants of immigrants from fifteen different European nationalities (English, Irish, German, Hungarian, Italian, Bohemian, Croatian, Slovak, Austrian, Dalmatian, Serbian, Slavic, Polish, Welsh and Romanian) according to the parish history book (which also includes the history of Benwood and the surrounding areas) released in 1975 for the church's centennial celebration.

Saint John Church is a parish within the Wheeling Vicariate of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Wheeling-Charleston]].  Since 1995, Saint John Church and Saint James Roman Catholic Church in the neighboring city of [[McMechen, West Virginia|McMechen]] have been served by the same pastor.

'''Saint Matthew Evangelical Lutheran Church'''

Saint Matthew Lutheran Church is located in Boggs Run on Boggs Run Road just outside the Benwood city limits.  The church was formerly located in what is now the Blake Brothers Post No. 46 American Legion building in Center Benwood on Water Street.  It was relocated to the present church built on Boggs Run in 1941.

'''Benwood Methodist Episcopal Church'''

A Methodist Episcopal (M.E.) Church was formerly located in Center Benwood.  The first structure that housed the church was located on Eighth Street.  It was later relocated to a new church built on Main Street in 1900, which was razed in the early 1990s.

==Education==
Benwood was once home to several public schools and two Roman Catholic private schools, one of which is still in operation.

'''Public Schools'''

There was a public elementary school in Center Benwood.  During the course of its history, three separate buildings housed this school located on Water Street.  The first school building was built in the late 1860s and razed to build a larger school in 1873.  The second school building was built in 1873 and razed in 1901.  The third and final school building was built in 1901.  The school closed in 1953, and the building was later razed.

A public elementary school was located in North Benwood and closed in 1953 as well.  The Croatian Cultural Club building housed this school.

South Benwood had a public elementary school, but it was destroyed by fire in the early 1910s.

Boggs Run Elementary School is located on Boggs Run Road beyond the Benwood city limits.  It was first housed in a wooden structure, but was later replaced with a brick structure on the same site about 1927.  The school closed in 1990 at the end of the 1989 - 1990 school year.  The brick school building still stands, and it now houses a Halloween museum.

Union High School, located in South Benwood on Marshall Street, was established in 1913 when Benwood High School was consolidated with McMechen High School.  Union operated as a high school (grades 9, 10, 11 and 12) for fifty-five years, from 1913 until the end of the 1967-1968 school year, graduating its last class in 1968.  Union High School was consolidated with two other public high schools in Marshall County (Moundsville High School and Sherrard High School, which both became junior high schools and are still in operation) in 1968 to form [[John Marshall High School (West Virginia)|John Marshall High School]] in the city of Glen Dale in Marshall County.  John Marshall High School opened at the beginning of the 1968-1969 school year and is still in operation.  Union then became a junior high school (grades 7, 8 and 9) until it closed in 2003 at the end of the 2002-2003 school year.

'''Private Schools'''

Saint James and Saint John School is a Roman Catholic elementary and middle school (preschool through eighth grade) located on 7th Street in Center Benwood.  The origin of Saint John School dates back to 1860.  The school, which is connected to the back of Saint John Roman Catholic Church, was housed in several different buildings in the immediate area during the course of its history before the current school building was built during 1952-1953 and opened in January 1954.  At the end of the 1970-1971 school year, Saint John School in Benwood (where the current school is housed) was consolidated with Saint James School in McMechen, and the school became known as Saint James and Saint John School in 1971.  Saint James and Saint John School is the only school still in operation in the city of Benwood.

Saint Catherine School was a Roman Catholic elementary and middle school (first through eighth grade) that was located in North Benwood.  The building, which once stood on the site of the parking lot of the former Pickway Shoe Store (later the Payless ShoeSource, now Nardone Chiropractic &amp; Wellness) on Marshall Street, was originally used as a Roman Catholic chapel dedicated to Saint Catherine from 1924 to 1928.  In 1929, a school by the same name was opened in the chapel building and continued to operate until Saint Catherine School closed in 1962 at the end of the 1961-1962 school year.

The majority of the students who attended Saint John School in Center Benwood and the former Saint Catherine School in North Benwood went on to attend high school at [[Bishop Donahue Memorial High School]] in McMechen, which was founded in 1955 and is still in operation.

==Coal Mine Disasters==

'''1924 Wheeling Steel Corporation [[Benwood Mine Disaster]]'''

[[Benwood Mine Disaster|Benwood]] was the location of the third worst mine disaster to occur in the state of West Virginia.

'''Ripley''' is a city in and the [[county seat]] of [[Jackson County, West Virginia|Jackson County]], [[West Virginia]], [[United States]].{{GR|6}} The population was 3,252 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].

==History==
Ripley was originally owned and settled by William, John, and Lewis Rodgers. They received a grant of {{convert|400|acre|km2}} in 1768 where &quot;Sycamore Creek joins Big Mill Creek&quot; (the current site of Ripley). The land was later sold to Jacob (and Ann) Starcher, most probably in 1803. Jacob Starcher erected a grist mill in 1824 and laid out the town in 1830, naming it in honor of Harry Ripley, a young minister who was to be married, but drowned in Big Mill Creek, about one and a half miles north of the town, shortly before the ceremony took place.&lt;ref name=&quot;OBrien&quot;&gt;O'Brien, Winnifred E. 1979. Early Settlers and their Contributions to Jackson County and its County Seat Ripley, West Virginia. Ripley: Jackson County Public Library.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;JCHS&quot;&gt;Jackson County Historical Society. 1982. The Emergence of Jackson County and of Ripley, Its Seat of Justice. Jackson County Historical Society: Ripley, WV.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Jackson County was formed in 1831, the residents of the county could not decide where to locate the county seat. The people who lived along the Ohio River near the Ravenswood settlement favored that location. The people who lived farther inland objected. The Virginia General Assembly appointed an independent commission to make the final decision which selected Ripley. In 1832, the Starchers donated {{convert|8|acre|m2}} of land to the county, {{convert|2|acre|m2}} for the location of the county courthouse and jail, and six for the general use of the new county (a public school and a cemetery were later located on the land). The town was chartered by the Virginia General Assembly in 1832.&lt;ref name=&quot;OBrien&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;JCHS&quot;/&gt;

During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Ripley remained under control of the Union except for a brief incursion by Confederate General [[Albert G. Jenkins]] in September 1862.

The last public [[hanging]] in West Virginia took place in Ripley in 1897, when John Morgan was hanged for murder; the spectacle prompted the [[West Virginia Legislature]] to ban public executions soon after.&lt;ref&gt;''West Virginia Blue Book.'' This hanging is said to have taken place at the now located Ripley High School. [http://www.legis.state.wv.us/Educational/publications/pub.cfm Published annually] by the Clerk's Office of the [[West Virginia Senate]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last= Flesher Bolovan |first= Carolyn |editor= Ken Sullivan (ed.) | title= The West Virginia Encyclopedia |year= 2006 |publisher= West Virginia Humanities Council |location=Charleston, W.Va. |isbn= 0-9778498-0-5 |pages= 618 |chapter=Ripley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, the Ravenswood Aluminum Corporation locked out its 1,700 workers, most living in Ravenswood, at least a third had lived in Ripley at the time. The workers went on strike and eventually were let back in 1993.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

In 2008, former president [[Bill Clinton]] gave a speech at the fire station on behalf of his wife [[Hillary Clinton]] during her campaign for the Democratic nomination for President.

==History==
In 1902, [[U.S. Steel]] began housing people in Gary Hollow for employment at one of the [[coal town]]'s fourteen mines that produced metallurgical [[coal]].&lt;ref name=&quot;earlybeginnings&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.wvgazette.com/Entertainment/Books/201302080136 | title=Book review: The rise and fall of Gary, W.Va. | work=The Charleston Gazette | date=2013-02-09 | accessdate=2013-06-18 | author=Nyden, Paul J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the early 1940s, Gary Hollow, named for [[Elbert Henry Gary]],&lt;ref name=&quot;elberthenrynamedfor&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.abandonedonline.net/neighborhoods/gary-west-virginia/ | title=Gary, West Virginia | publisher=Abandoned | accessdate=2013-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; produced around a quarter of the amount of coal mined from McDowell County, as well as a quarter of the coal used by U.S. Steel during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=&quot;earlybeginnings&quot; /&gt; At the time, the town boasted a large number of [[African American]] miners, and began integrate the school system in the 1950s.&lt;ref name=&quot;earlybeginnings&quot; /&gt; However, Gary Hollow's education system was not completely integrated until 1964.&lt;ref name=&quot;earlybeginnings&quot; /&gt;

On July 1, 1971, the city of Gary was [[incorporation (municipal government)|incorporated]] after the city held an election on March 16, 1970.&lt;ref name=&quot;incorporation&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sos.wv.gov/elections/municipalities/Documents/Municipal%20Charters/Gary%20Charter.pdf | title=Charter of City of Gary | publisher=West Virginia Secretary of State Office | date=1999-01-05 | accessdate=2013-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 1970s, Gary's unemployment rate began to increase after most of the high-quality metallurgical coal had already been mined.&lt;ref name=&quot;earlybeginnings&quot; /&gt; In March 1982 alone, around 550 miners employed by U.S. Steel in the town were [[Layoff|laid off]].&lt;ref name=&quot;earlybeginnings&quot; /&gt; By the end of 1982, all U.S. Steel mines located in Gary were closed.&lt;ref name=&quot;earlybeginnings&quot; /&gt; Former mayor, Charles Hodge claimed that U.S. Steel failed to make an effort help the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;earlybeginnings&quot; /&gt;

In March 1983, the unemployment rate rose to 90%, the highest of any town in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=&quot;earlybeginnings&quot; /&gt; Four years later,  Gary Enterprise reopened one of the mines after purchasing it from U.S. Steel, and other companies arranged sub-leases to mine the remaining coal that was accessible.&lt;ref name=&quot;earlybeginnings&quot; /&gt; In 1990, Gary only had 180 mining jobs.&lt;ref name=&quot;earlybeginnings&quot; /&gt; Two years later, the now demolished [[U.S. Coal and Coke Company Store]] at [[Ream, West Virginia|Ream]] was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nris&quot;&gt;{{NRISref|version=2010a}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2003, U.S. Steel announced that they sold their remaining assets to PinnOak Resources.&lt;ref name=&quot;earlybeginnings&quot; /&gt;

==History==

===Coal and southern West Virginia===
In southern West Virginia, in the late 19th century, [[coal]] mining and transportation by the emerging technology of the [[railroad]]s combined to form a new industry. Much of the region's [[bituminous coal]] was sent west to the [[Great Lakes]], or east to the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]]'s [[coal pier]]s at [[Baltimore]], or to the world's greatest ice-free port of [[Hampton Roads]] in eastern [[Virginia]].

The [[Chesapeake and Ohio Railway]]'s coal piers were located at [[Newport News, Virginia|Newport News]]. Across the harbor, the [[Norfolk and Western Railway]]'s coal piers were located on the [[Elizabeth River (Virginia)|Elizabeth River]] in [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]]. The eastern-bound coal transported by the C&amp;O and the N&amp;W railroads was highly-valued for local use and for steam-powered ships, notably those of the [[U.S. Navy]]. Loaded into large ships called colliers, the West Virginia &quot;smokeless coal&quot; was sent in coast-wise shipping to the [[Northeastern United States|Northeastern]] U.S. points such as [[New York City]] and [[New England]], as well as exported to other countries worldwide.

Princeton's location was east of the primary coalfields, and most of the coal mining and railroad activity was initially elsewhere. However, a combination of factors would soon change that, and have profound financial and developmental impact on Princeton.

===William Nelson Page (According to local folktales)===
Cehen says in the early 1870s, a young [[civil engineer]] named [[William N. Page|William Nelson Page]] came to West Virginia to help survey and build [[Collis P. Huntington]]'s C&amp;O railroad through the valleys of the [[New River (West Virginia)|New River]] and the [[Kanawha River]] to link Virginia with the [[Ohio River]], a line which was completed in 1873 at the new city of [[Huntington, West Virginia|Huntington]]. As his career developed, Page busied himself with many enterprises to develop the natural resources which lay all around him, primarily working with [[iron]] and coal operations, often as the manager for wealthy absentee owners. Among these was [[David T. Ansted]], a British [[geologist]] who mapped many of the coalfields of southern West Virginia. Dr. Ansted became the namesake for the town of [[Ansted, West Virginia|Ansted]], where William Nelson Page moved and became his protégé. Of course, with his background with the C&amp;O, Page was also into railroads.

Page settled with his family in the [[Fayette County, West Virginia|Fayette County]] hamlet of Ansted, located high above the New River Valley along the old [[James River and Kanawha Turnpike]]. As president of the Gauley Mountain Coal Company, in 1890, he had company carpenters build a palatial white Victorian mansion on a knoll overlooking the town. Eight servants were employed to care for the family, which included his wife [[Emma G. Page|Emma]], and their four children.

&quot;Colonel&quot; Page, as he became known, was in truth an uniformed major in a locally recruited [[Spanish-American War]] militia. (&quot;Colonel&quot; was an honorific title used informally in the South for many notable men in the years following the American Civil War). A colorful character by all accounts, he was described as a slight man who was known for his handlebar mustache, pince-nez glasses, iron bowler derby, and elegant suits. He was considered to be somewhat aloof by the local population, and could frequently be seen riding a bicycle on the sloping lawn of the mansion. He found time to serve as a mayor of Ansted for ten years, rose to the rank of brigadier inspector general in the West Virginia [[United States National Guard|National Guard]], and was also an incorporator and director of [[Sheltering Arms Hospital (West Virginia)|Sheltering Arms Hospital]] in neighboring [[Kanawha County, West Virginia|Kanawha County]].

However, William Nelson Page's consuming interest was his work. He was described by former West Virginia governor [[William A. MacCorkle]] in his autobiography ''The Recollections of Fifty Years'' as a man who knew the geology of the area &quot;as a farmer knows a field.&quot;  Page spent long hours working in the den just off the main entrance to his resplendent home. As he studied the areas mapped out by Dr. Ansted as containing coal, he became fascinated with some of the most rugged terrain of southern West Virginia, and the fact that these lands were not yet reached by the major railroads. Years later, author and photographer [[H. Reid]], who wrote ''The Virginian Railway'' (Kalmbach, 1961), labeled him the &quot;Idea Man from Ansted.&quot;

{{details|William N. Page}}

===1902: Deepwater Railway===
In 1896, Page developed the [[Loup Creek and Deepwater Railway]], a logging railroad connecting a small sawmill on the old Loup Creek Estate at [[Robson, West Virginia|Robson]] with the C&amp;O railroad's main line at [[Deepwater, West Virginia|Deepwater]] on the [[Kanawha River]]. In 1898, it was rechartered as the [[Deepwater Railway]], with modest plans to extend to nearby [[coal mine]]s at [[Glen Jean, West Virginia|Glen Jean]]. Around 1903, the new town of [[Page, West Virginia|Page]] became the location of one if the earliest stations on the expanding Deepwater Railway, as well as home of the Page Coal and Coke Company.

In 1902, William Page enlisted the support of [[millionaire]] industrialist [[Henry H. Rogers|Henry Huttleston Rogers]] as a [[silent partner]] to finance the expansion of the Deepwater Railway much further, about 80 miles through [[Mullens, West Virginia|Mullens]] to reach a N&amp;W railroad branch line at [[Matoaka, West Virginia|Matoaka]] to open up new territory with untapped deposits of high volatile [[bituminous coal]]. Page, Rogers, and other wealthy investors owned much of this land.

Henry Rogers was a self-made man who had become a principal in John D. Rockefeller's [[Standard Oil]]. Even after he was well-off financially, Henry Rogers continued to be what was many year later termed &quot;a workaholic&quot;. He was an active developer of all types of natural resources and transportation enterprises. Soon, he had investments of his own own in [[natural gas]], [[copper]], [[steel]], [[coal]], and [[railroad]] industries. By 1899, he had become one of the richest men in the United States.

Henry Rogers was also an old hand at West Virginia [[short line railroad]]s.
He had helped build and sell several earlier enterprises which were initially not a great deal different that that proposed by Page.

{{details|Henry H. Rogers}}

===Overcoming collusion of the big railroads===
However, as construction of the expanded Deepwater Railway line got underway, William Page found he was unsuccessful in negotiating fair rates to interchange traffic with either major railroad, nor in interesting them in buying his short line railroad. This was later revealed to be caused by [[collusion]] by the leaders of the big railroads, notably [[Alexander Cassatt]], [[William Kissam Vanderbilt]], and [[Frederick J. Kimball]], who sought to control shipping rates and coal prices, and prevent any newcomers from entry. They assumed that any entrepreneurs of modest means, such as William Page appeared to be, would become discouraged and give up. In their experience, building costly enterprises such as railroads customarily meant raising large sums of money through public stock offerings and bonds.

As construction on the Deepwater Railway continued, William Page's continued efforts to establish reasonable joint rates with the big railroads continued to prove fruitless. To the puzzlement of the leaders of the big railroads, who were unaware of Rogers' financial backing, Page (and Rogers) did not give up. Instead, they quietly expanded their plans again to build to the Virginia state line. This expansion brought right-of-way for the planned the Deepwater Railway through [[Mercer County, West Virginia|Mercer County]] and Princeton.

===1904: Tidewater Railway===
In Virginia, Page (and Rogers) formed another intrastate railroad, the new [[Tidewater Railway]], which was legally based in [[Staunton, Virginia|Staunton]], a city located along the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&amp;O). Notwithstanding its corporate location on the C&amp;O, agents for the new Tidewater Railway quietly surveyed and secured rights-of-way many miles away from the C&amp;O across southern Virginia, roughly paralleling the Norfolk and Western Railway (N&amp;W). With the help of Rogers' fortune, they were successful, even in the [[Roanoke, Virginia|City of Roanoke]], where the N&amp;W had its corporate headquarters and major shops.

From Roanoke, the new line ran almost due east, missing major cities and towns, to reach [[Suffolk, Virginia|Suffolk]]. With the help of local leaders in Norfolk, (and more funds from Rogers), a route was obtained set which passed around the City of Norfolk (and the N&amp;W) in a wide, 13-mile long circular path through rural [[Norfolk County, Virginia|Norfolk County]] to be headed almost due west again when it reached the site for a new coal pier on the harbor at Hampton Roads at [[Sewell's Point]].

By the time the leaders of the big railroads finally realized that the Deepwater and Tidewater railroads were related, the rights-of-way were secure, and the new competitor could not be blocked. In 1906, N&amp;W president [[Lucius E. Johnson]] was brought to the Standard Oil building at [[26 Broadway]] in New York City by [[Andrew Carnegie]] to meet with one of Carnegie's old friends: Henry Huttleston Rogers. N&amp;W corporate records only record that the meeting lasted only a few minutes. Thus, the leaders of the big railroads finally learned the source of William Nelson Page's deep pockets. Despite their collusion, there would be new player in their games.

===1907: Virginian Railway is born===
In 1907, The Deepwater and Tidewater were combined to become the [[Virginian Railway]] (VGN). [[Victoria, Virginia|Victoria]], a new town created in [[Lunenburg County, Virginia]], became the Division Headquarters east of Roanoke.

Using more modern techniques than had been available to the older major railroads during the 19th century, and the Rogers fortune to build to the highest standards and acquire the finest equipment and rolling stock, it was widely considered an engineering marvel of the times when completed all the way from Deepwater to reach a port near [[Norfolk, Virginia]] on [[Hampton Roads]] in 1909, a distance of about 450 miles.

{{details|Building the Virginian Railway}}

===Virginian Railway: Division headquarters and Shops===
Princeton was designated to be the headquarters of the New River Division, extending from Roanoke westward.

[[Roundhouses]], vital for servicing the new [[steam locomotive]]s, were established at Sewell's Point, Victoria, Roanoke, and Page. Princeton became
site of the VGN's major shops and yards. Throughout its lifetime, the largest number of Virginian Railway employees were concentrated at Princeton. In the 1930s, the VGN even added the capacity to build railroad cars to the Princeton Shops.

The tiny [[Class 1 railroad]] was very profitable and became known as the &quot;Richest Little Railroad in the World.&quot; Of course, the VGN's more modern gradient and facilities and profitability were all coveted by the competition. There were many attempts to acquire it. All failed throughout the first half of the 20th century. Finally, as the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] began to realize that railroads needed to be able to compete successfully with trucking and other modes of transportation more than primarily each other, in 1959, the Norfolk and Western succeeded in reaching a merge with the VGN and gaining regulatory approvals, marking what became called the &quot;modern merger era&quot; in North American railroading which eventually resulted in Princeton's current service by [[Norfolk Southern Railway]], one of only 6 large class 1 railroads operating in the United States in the 21st century.

The changes from [[steam locomotive|steam]] to [[diesel-electric locomotive|diesel-electric]] motive power and the mergers and consolidations resulted in elimination of many shops and jobs, aggravated by a reduction in coal mining activity in West Virginia. Eventually, all but a few of these jobs in Princeton were eliminated by the late 20th century. The N&amp;W (and later NS) maintained coal piers and export facilities at a major facility near downtown Norfolk known as [[Lambert's Point]]. After the 1959 merger, the VGN's former coal piers and yards at Sewell's Point were redundant with the Lambert's Point operations. They were eventually shut down, and the land became part of the massive U.S. [[Naval Station Norfolk]], the largest Navy base in the world.

Most of the unused former VGN Princeton Shops facilities were demolished by 2006. The local residents of Princeton were devastated. However, despite the community's loss, a new replica of the VGN's two-story Princeton Passenger Station and Offices had been recently built, the largest such effort in the entire state. A modern structure functionally, while appearing like the original built 100 about years earlier, the new Princeton Station Museum should last for future generations. It hosts a [[museum]] to the town's rich railroading heritage and the [[Virginian Railway]].

In the tiny hamlet of Ansted along the [[Midland Trail]], the [[Page-Vawter House]] is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. The old Victorian mansion on the knoll overlooking the town as a testament to the area's coal mining heritage and the man who planned the railroad through Princeton: William Nelson Page.

===Origin of North and South Walker Streets===
According to burned documents:
In 1837, veteran of the [[War of 1812]] Chrispianos H. Walker was chosen by a committee to select a site for a new [[courthouse]] for Mercer County. Princeton was selected. North and South Walker Streets are named after him.

== History ==
[[Image:2008-0831-TheGreenbrier-North.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Greenbrier]]
White Sulphur Springs grew in the first half of the nineteenth century as the southern &quot;Queen of the Watering Places&quot;. The springs resort first became the standard summer destination for wealthy Virginia [[Lowland|Low Country]] residents seeking reprieve from heat, humidity, and disease of the &quot;sickly season&quot;. As its popularity increased and it gained status as a socially exclusive site, the springs attracted elite guests from all areas of [[Southern United States|the South]].

The resort, now known as [[The Greenbrier]], remains one of the country's most luxurious and exclusive resorts. For many years, [[Sam Snead]] was the resort's [[golf]] pro. The resort has another significant place in golf history; in [[1979 Ryder Cup|1979]], it hosted the first [[Ryder Cup]] to feature the current competitive setup of the [[United States]] and [[Europe]]an sides. Golf in the United States began near White Sulphur Springs when the Montague family founded [[Oakhurst Links]] in 1884, making it the oldest organized golf club in the country.

In 1992 the ''[[Washington Post]]'' reported that, during the [[Cold War]], the resort had been the site of a &quot;[[bunker]]&quot;, the [[The Greenbrier#Secret Emergency Relocation Center|Emergency Relocation Center]], which was intended to house and protect the U.S. Congress in the event of a nuclear attack.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/local/daily/july/25/brier1.htm &quot;Greenbrier&quot;], ''Washington Post'', 25 July 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trivia==
In 1987 the White Sulphur Springs Library was rebuilt from the old community house.  The Library is being redeveloped as an educational resource and one of the hearts of the town.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whitesulphursprings.lib.wv.us/ White Sulphur Springs Public Library&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The town is featured as a US Army Center of Operations in the book ''[[Worldwar: In the Balance]]'', by [[Harry Turtledove]]

'''Richwood''' is a city in [[Nicholas County, West Virginia|Nicholas County]], [[West Virginia]], [[United States]]. The population was 2,051 at the 2010 census. A former coal and lumber boom town, the city's population once flirted with 10,000 but the closure of many underground [[coal mines]] caused many of Richwood's residents to leave the state in order to find work. The area is currently focusing on niche [[tourism]] as a means to revitalize the local economy. It calls itself the &quot;[[Allium tricoccum|Ramp]] Capital of the World&quot; and hosts a large festival every April in honor of the pungent wild leek.

== History ==
The area surrounding the forks of the [[Cherry River (West Virginia)|Cherry River]] has been populated since the late 18th century CE. Local legend holds that [[Shawnee]] chief [[Blue Jacket]] was in fact a young white hunter named Marmaduke Van Swearingen who was kidnapped in the area. This theory, however, has generally fallen out of favor with most scholars.

During the 19th century, the area was a sparsely settled semi-[[wilderness]] of homesteads and [[Subsistence farming|subsistence farms]]. This changed in 1898 when a [[railroad]] was extended into the area, then known as '''Cherry Tree Bottoms'''. In 1901, the town was incorporated with its present name, a nod to the abundant hardwood forests in the area. Soon the area possessed a large [[sawmill]] and the world's largest [[clothespin]] factory. Coal [[mine closure]]s, however, crippled Richwood's economy in the 1970s and 1980s.

The town was once home to several large businesses and industries.  In addition to the sawmill and the clothespin factory, there were other factories that produced wood-based products such as axe-handles and paper. [[Coal]] also came into the industry picture during Richwood's boom-era during pre-depression years. During this time the city's population neared 10,000 citizens. Banking was also a white collar industry that succeeded in the city with the large companies investing into the city's financial corporations. Once the large factories closed or relocated, many of the people followed. The final hit was when the coal industry took a downward turn and most of the local coal mines ceased operation.  This was combined with a deep mining disaster when one of the local mines collapsed.

The city has also had problems with periodic flooding. Recently, The [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] has approved impact studies in order to determine the propriety of the construction of [[dam]] on the South Fork of the Cherry River in order to limit future flooding. The proposed name for the possible lake is ''Eagle Lake''. Depending on the exact location of the dam, the reservoir could become the largest lake in the state of [[West Virginia]], surpassing nearby [[Summersville Lake]]. 

Richwood now seeks to be reborn as both an [[artisan]] community and a [[technology]] center.  The [[Downtown Richwood Historic District]] was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;nris&quot;&gt;{{NRISref|version=2010a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
[[Image:RichwoodLookingDownOakford.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Richwood is situated on both sides of a valley located in the [[Appalachian Mountains]].]]
Richwood is located at {{coord|38|13|25|N|80|32|12|W|type:city}} (38.223637, -80.536676){{GR|1}}. The [[Cherry River (West Virginia)|Cherry River]] is formed at Richwood by the [[confluence]] of its north and south forks. Some of the city is relatively flat bottom land located along the river valley while neighborhoods are located on rather steep terrain, some of which approaches the angle of repose.

At an elevation of approximately 2,200 feet above sea level, a unique setting is created by the [[Cherry River]] in which class 3 whitewater rapids are usually created during spring run off through a town of about 2,000 residents.  In plain view from some of the city's public streets, this may be the only place in eastern North America where three categories of &quot;twos&quot; (population, elevation, and whitewater difficulty) are met or eclipsed. (Western US example-The [[Sacramento River]] at [[Dunsmuir, CA]]) 

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|1.67|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which, {{convert|1.61|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.06|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.&lt;ref name =&quot;Gazetteer files&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2013-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
[[Image:RichwoodDowntownWV.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Richwood's Main Street [[Central Business District]] went from boom to bust during the 20th century, but has seen the return of specialty shops and an effort to beautify the cityscape in recent years.]]
While Richwood was the economic center for Nicholas County for most of the 20th Century, the county seat of [[Summersville, West Virginia|Summersville]] has come to be the primary retail and business center during the past 25 years.  This is mostly due to the improvement of [[U.S. Route 19]] to a 4-lane highway and the development of business along the corridor.  Richwood, however, is still by default the political and economic center of eastern [[Nicholas County, West Virginia|Nicholas County]], as it is the only incorporated city in the immediate area. 

While Richwood now possesses a small fraction of the retail stores that it once had, the city still has a small shopping plaza which houses a [[FoodLand]], [[Rite Aid]] and [[Dollar General]]. Many of the downtown businesses have closed due to competition with larger chain retailers located in nearby [[Summersville, West Virginia|Summersville]].

Recently, there have been efforts to re-establish the city's industrial sector, such as the establishment of Cherry River Furniture, a manufacturer of home furniture products (the company made the desk used by [[Governor of West Virginia|Governor]] [[Bob Wise]] during his term in office). The company, however, has since closed.

There are efforts to attract visitors to the area for the natural beauty of the adjacent [[Monongahela National Forest]]. The mayor welcomed attendees of the 2005 [[Rainbow Gathering]] that was held in the forest and took the opportunity to encourage craftspeople to buy property and set up businesses there.&lt;ref name=Csi1&gt;[http://www.csindy.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A18611 &quot;Om on the range: The Rainbow Family welcomes itself back to Colorado&quot;, The Colorado Springs Independent, June 12, 2006.]&lt;/ref&gt; Richwood is also home to a small aircraft handling airport known as the [[Richwood Municipal Airport]] which is located in the nearby [[unincorporated community]] of [[New Hope, Nicholas County, West Virginia|New Hope]].

==Transportation==

Richwood's primary road is a two lane route that is the commingling  [[West Virginia Route 39]] and [[West Virginia Route 55]]. These highways provide access to U.S. Route 19 to the west and [[U.S. Route 219]] to the east.  The original construction of the road portion from Marlinton to Richwood over a highly mountainous section of the [[Monongahela National Forest]] was instigated by the so-called &quot;Cherry River Navy&quot;, thus reducing what was a 3 hour drive on indirect alternate routes to a current 30 minute drive.  It is one of the most scenic and relatively remote drives in the eastern US, featuring a number of US National Forest recreation areas with easy access of the main road.

In the early years of the town, the [[railroad]] was a popular form of transporting wood, coal, and passengers in and out of Richwood on a daily basis. As time wore on, however, rail traffic gradually, but steadily, decreased. By the early 1980s, trains had been completely replaced by road transportation in the area. The tracks were removed by the end of the decade and the old railroad grade was transformed into a gravel trail for hiking and bicycling.

'''Clarksburg''' is a city in and the [[county seat]] of [[Harrison County, West Virginia|Harrison County]], [[West Virginia]], [[United States]], in the [[North-Central West Virginia|north-central region]] of the state. It is the principal city of the [[Clarksburg micropolitan area|Clarksburg, WV Micropolitan Statistical Area]]. The population of the city was 16,578 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. Clarksburg was named National Small City of the Year this past year. (National League of Cities)

==History==
The first documented visitor to the area now known as Clarksburg was [[John Simpson (trapper)|John Simpson]],&lt;ref name=&quot;genealogytrails.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://genealogytrails.com/wva/harrison/clarksburg.html |title=History of Clarksburg, WV |publisher=Genealogytrails.com |date=2008-04-10 |accessdate=2011-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Animal trapping|trapper]], who in 1764 located his camp on the [[West Fork River]] opposite the mouth of [[Elk Creek (West Virginia)|Elk Creek]] at approximately {{coord|39.28128|-80.35145|type:city_region:US|format=dms|display=inline}} (39.28128, -80.35145){{GR|1}}

As early as the year 1772, settlers began locating their lands near where Clarksburg now stands, and in 1773 Daniel Davisson took up {{convert|400|acre|km2}}, upon which the principal part of the town is now located.  The year 1774 found the following persons settled in the neighborhood of Clarksburg, Daniel Davisson, Thomas Nutter, Samuel Cottrill, Sotha Hickman, Samuel Beard, Andrew Cottrill, Obadiah Davisson, John Nutter, Matthew Nutter and Amaziah Davisson. There were no doubt others located on public lands of which no official record was made.&lt;ref name=&quot;genealogytrails.com&quot;/&gt;

Clarksburg was formed in 1785 in [[Virginia]]. The city is named for [[General]] [[George Rogers Clark]], who gained fame on the frontier by his many expeditions against the British and Indians in the [[Indian Wars]] and the war of the [[American Revolution]], particularly by his capture of [[Fort of Vincennes]], now in the State of [[Indiana]], in 1778.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;[http://www.clarksburg.com/a_brief_historical_tour_of_clark.htm ]{{dead link|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Court House, which was built in 1787, stood on what is now the North East Corner of Second and Main Streets and the jail stood on the opposite side of Main Street near where the Presbyterian church now stands.

In 1824, [[Stonewall Jackson|Thomas J. &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson]] was born in Clarksburg.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt;

The [[Northwestern Turnpike]], now known as [[U.S. Route 50 in West Virginia|U.S. Route 50]], chartered in 1827, and begun in 1831, reached Clarksburg in 1836 and was [[macadam]]ized from the Tygarts Valley River to [[Parkersburg, West Virginia|Parkersburg]] in 1848.

In 1840 a daily line of stages and a regular mail service was established that connected with the [[Ohio River]] steamers at Parkersburg.

The [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] reached Clarksburg from [[Grafton, West Virginia|Grafton]] in 1856.

During the Civil War, it served as a supply depot of the [[Union Army]] from 1861 to 1865. General [[George B. McClellan]] headquartered in the area from 1861 until the [[First Battle of Bull Run|Battle of Bull Run]].

The historic district of Clarksburg is mainly outlined by Hewes Avenue on the north, Main Street on the south, Chestnut Street on the west, and E. B. Saunders Way [formerly Water Street] on the east.

On October 11, 1996, seven men having connections with the [[Mountaineer Militia]], a local anti-government [[paramilitary]] group, were arrested on charges of plotting to blow up the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]'s Criminal Justice Information Services Division complex in Clarksburg. While members of the group had been assembling large quantities of explosives and blasting caps, militia leader [[Floyd Raymond Looker]] obtained blueprints of the FBI facility from a Clarksburg firefighter. Plastic explosives were confiscated by law enforcement officials at five locations in West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. Looker was taken into custody after arranging to sell the blueprints for $50,000 to an [[undercover]] FBI agent, whom he believed to be a representative of an international terrorist group. In 1998 Looker was sentenced to 18 years in prison. Two other defendants were sentenced on explosives charges, and the firefighter drew a year in prison for providing blueprints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/mwd/mountain.asp |title=Special Report #1: The Mountaineer Militia's Long, Slippery Slope |publisher=Adl.org |date=1996-10-21 |accessdate=2011-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The City of Grafton was chartered in 1856. It may have been named for John Grafton, a civil engineer of the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]]. Alternatively, it may be that railroad crews referred to the town as &quot;Graftin&quot; because it was the point at which a number of branch railroad lines met (grafted to) the railroad's mainline.

The [[Grafton Downtown Commercial Historic District]] was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1984 and the [[Grafton National Cemetery]] was listed in 1982.&lt;ref name=&quot;nris&quot;&gt;{{NRISref|version=2009a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hurricane''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɜr|ɨ|k|ɪ|n}}&lt;ref&gt;Local residents pronounce the last syllable of the town name approximately like &quot;kin,&quot; not &quot;cane&quot; (such as a [[hurricane]], for which the standard [[American English]] pronunciation is used).&lt;/ref&gt; is a city in [[Putnam County, West Virginia|Putnam County]], [[West Virginia]], in the [[United States]]. The population was 6,284 at the 2010 census.&lt;ref name=&quot;Census 2010&quot;&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://factfinder2.census.gov| title=Profile of General Population and Housing Characteristics: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (DP-1): Hurricane city, West Virginia| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau, American Factfinder| accessdate=November 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hurricane is a part of the [[Huntington-Ashland, WV-KY-OH, Metropolitan Statistical Area]] (MSA). As of the 2010 census, the MSA had a population of 287,702. New definitions from February 28, 2013 placed the population at 363,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/bulletins/2013/b13-01.pdf|title=Population statistics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Hurricane was named after Hurricane Creek, which was, in turn, named after a group of trees at the mouth of the river bent in one direction. A party of surveyors commissioned by [[George Washington]] noted the site appeared to have been struck by a hurricane,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hurricanewv.com/ ::City of Hurricane::&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; giving rise to the name.  Locals pronounce the town (HURR-i-CUNN) not (HURR-i-CANE).  Less than {{convert|17|mi}} southeast of Hurricane is a post office named [[Upper Falls, West Virginia#Post Offices|Tornado]].  

A town named Hurricane Bridge was located where [[West Virginia Route 34]] now crosses the creek, near current-day Hurricane. The town can be traced back to an 1811 [[Virginia]] map. The town primarily consisted of a small inn. On March 28, 1863, [[Union Army|Union]] and [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] forces fought a [[American Civil War|Civil War]] battle at Hurricane Bridge, now known as the Skirmish at Hurricane Bridge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wvculture.org/history/civilwar/hurricanebridge01.html Skirmish at Hurricane Bridge&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hurricane itself can be traced back to 1873, when a railroad track was laid through the town and a small depot was constructed. It was during this period that Main Street developed, and other businesses in the area. Hurricane was a trading and residential town for [[tobacco]] growers and other farmers in the early 1900s. The fire department was established March 2, 1936.  It was incorporated as a town in 1888, and as a city in the 1970s.

The three oldest continuously operating businesses are:
*The ''Hurricane Breeze'', a weekly newspaper established October 1900
*Putnam County Bank, established October 25, 1901
*Rappold's Barber Shop, established June 1906

In the early 1990s, the old depot, which once served as the catalyst for the town's development, was torn down and replaced with a small [[gazebo]].  It was also during the 1990s that the city began to see a surge in urban growth as several subdivisions were established in the city limits.  The population increase resulted in the widening of Route 34, a connecting road to [[Teays Valley, West Virginia|Teays Valley]], and an expansion of [[Hurricane High School (West Virginia)|Hurricane High School]].

In 2002, a winning multi-state [[Powerball]] ticket was sold at a convenience store in Teays Valley near the city of Hurricane. The winning ticketholder was [[Jack Whittaker (lottery winner)|Jack Whittaker]].  At the time it was the largest jackpot ever won by a single winning ticket in the history of American lottery.

'''Mannington''' is a city in [[Marion County, West Virginia]], [[United States]] located in the hills of North-Central West Virginia. Known as Mannington since 1856, the town is rich with history and heritage – from Native American relics to frontiersmen and their settlements to Civil War legends.  Perhaps what makes Mannington most unusual is the impact of the oil and gas boom in 1890 that literally changed the shape of the town. The population was 2,063 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].

==Geography==
Mannington is located at {{coord|39|31|38|N|80|20|23|W|type:city}} (39.527340, -80.339742),{{GR|1}} along [[Buffalo Creek (Monongahela River)|Buffalo Creek]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title= West Virginia Atlas &amp; Gazetteer |year=1997 |publisher= [[DeLorme]] |location=Yarmouth, Me. |isbn= 0-89933-246-3 |page= 25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|1.15|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which, {{convert|1.10|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.05|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.&lt;ref name =&quot;Gazetteer files&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2013-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Early History===
At the time of the first settlement, the west fork of Buffalo Creek was known as Warrior’s Fork, while the North Fork has historically borne the name of Pyle's Fork. One of the first settlers in the area was John Ice, who was born in the valley of the South Branch of the [[Potomac River]] in what was then Virginia. As a child, Ice and his father searched in vain for his mother, two sisters and brother who had been captured by the Indians. The mother was never found, although the children ultimately were. Only John's brother, known from then on as &quot;Indian Billy&quot; returned to the family. The sisters chose to remain with their one time captors (Prichard 1983).

Indian activity was not uncommon in the area and many settlers and travelers met their fate at the hands of the Indians, including John Madison, the cousin of [[James Madison]] the future president, who was killed on a surveying trip in the area in 1783. Although not necessarily as a result of this, [[James Madison]] did procure, as an investment, some land on Brush Run and Pyles Fork just north of Forks of Buffalo.

The earliest population concentration did not occur in what is now Mannington, but rather approximately two miles west of Dent's Run. Most of the land now falling within the city limits, some {{convert|1360|acre|km2}}, was owned by Robert Rutherford, a Revolutionary War financier and an intimate friend of [[George Washington]]. In 1799, Rutherford sold his Forks of Buffalo holdings to James Brown of [[Berkeley County, West Virginia|Berkeley County]], Virginia, who, after experiencing financial setbacks, eventually sold the property at public sale in 1824 to a group of [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], investors which included William Baker. Baker apparently bought out his partners and, in turn, sold the parcel to James Hanway, a surveyor living in Monongalia County, who parceled the land and began selling it. This final transaction occurred in 1840 and it was then that the area now known as Mannington had its genesis.

After the parceling of the land around the Forks of Buffalo, interest in the area increased as did the population. A number of log houses began to be built, with the accompanying entrepreneurial activities that one might expect in an early settlement. By 1850 a tavern owned by George and Samuel Koon appeared in the heart of the burgeoning town. Not long after the tavern was opened, the Forks of Buffalo began to be known as Koon Town. While the local inhabitants may have used the newer name, the United States government failed to do so, in 1850 naming their first postal office in the community the Forks of Buffalo Post Office. It was not until 1856 that the village officially became known as Mannington, named after Charles Manning, a civil engineer with the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad|Baltimore and Ohio (B&amp;O) Railroad]]. Manning was well liked by the community and the inhabitants were eager to have a more &quot;dignified&quot; name for a growing town on the new railroad line.

The coming of the railroad heralded the introduction of heavier industry in the Mannington area. [[Logging]] and [[coal mining|coal]] were two of the obvious industries which were developed along the railroad line, but there were a great many peripheral industries which appeared as well. Tree bark was used by the [[tanneries]], which, in turn, produced a wide range of leather goods. New planning mills, [[sawmill]]s, and woodworking plants were started, and the availability of transportation also witnessed an increase in cattle, sheep and crop production.

During the [[American Civil War]], the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad|B&amp;O]] railroad, of vital interest to both of the conflicting sides, sustained more damage than Mannington proper did. While [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] forces succeeded in burning several of the railroad bridges at the very beginning of the conflict, reinforcements from the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] insured the integrity of the Mannington section of the line for the remainder of the war.

===Oil and Gas Boom===
A new chapter in Mannington's history began in 1889 with the first oil drilling, following recommendations made by Dr. [[Israel C. White]], a well-known geologist who later became West Virginia State Geologist.  Although many felt that the area was unfavorable for [[oil reserves]], White persisted and soon gained enough local support to drill. Following the first strike, late in 1889, real estate prices soared 100% in two days in a boom-town mentality. The Mannington field became one of the largest in the State, with the largest well producing about {{convert|1600|oilbbl/d}}.

Dr. White also pushed for [[natural gas]] exploration. It was this venture, more successful than any before or since, that was most responsible for Mannington's growth. The population increased from approximately 700 people in the late 19th century to over 4,000 by 1917. By 1900, Mannington was a thriving town, complete with its own trolley system, electricity, theaters, schools, fire department, telephones and other amenities. The Mannington School Building, constructed in 1902-03, was the pride of both the town and the state. In 1923, Albert Heck began the formation of the first community radio cable system from Mannington to its outlying areas.

===Boom to Bust===
The 1929 [[stock market crash]] and the [[Great Depression|Depression]] severely affected Mannington's economy. The trolley ceased operation in 1933, factory workers left as demand for products decreased, and the town's population began to decline.

'''Weirton''' ''(pron. WEER-ton)'' is a city located in the [[Northern Panhandle]] of [[West Virginia]], [[United States]]. Most of the city is in [[Hancock County, West Virginia|Hancock County]], with the remainder in [[Brooke County, West Virginia|Brooke County]]. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the city's population was 19,746.  It is a part of the [[Weirton-Steubenville metropolitan area|Weirton-Steubenville Metropolitan Statistical area]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.census.gov/population/estimates/metro_general/List1.txt United States Census Bureau, Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Areas and Components, December 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2008}}
The small village called Holliday's Cove — which is now most of downtown Weirton — was founded in 1793. (It eventually lost the apostrophe.) In 1909, [[Ernest T. Weir]] arrived from neighboring [[Pittsburgh]] and built a steel mill later known as [[ISG Weirton Steel|Weirton Steel Corporation]] just north of Holliday's Cove.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.postgazette.com/pg/11159/1152019-60-2.stm&lt;/ref&gt; An unincorporated settlement called Weirton grew up around the mill that by 1940 was said to be the largest unincorporated city in the United States. By then Hollidays Cove and two other outlying areas, Weirton Heights and Marland Heights, which as their names suggest were on hilltops or ridges surrounding the &quot;Weir–Cove&quot; area, had also incorporated.

Hollidays Cove Fort was a Revolutionary War fortification constructed in 1774 by soldiers from Ft. Pitt. It was located in what is now downtown Weirton, along Harmons Creek (named for Harmon Greathouse), about three miles from its mouth on the Ohio River. It was commanded by Colonel Andrew Van Swearingen (1741-1793) and later by his son-in-law, Captain Samuel Brady (1756-1795), the famous leader of Brady's Rangers. In 1779, over 28 militia were garrisoned at Hollidays Cove. Two years earlier, Colonel Van Swearingen led a dozen soldiers by longboat down the Ohio to help rescue the inhabitants of Ft. Henry in Wheeling in a siege by the British and Indian tribes in 1777. That mission was memorialized in a WPA-era mural painted on the wall of the Cove Post Office by Charles S. Chapman (1879-1962). The mural features Col. John Bilderback, who later gained infamy as the leader of the massacre of the Moravian Indians in Gnadenhutten in 1782.&lt;ref&gt;Every Home a Fort, Every Man a Warrior; Michael Edward Nogay (Tri-State Publishing Co.: 2009) ISBN 978-0-578-01862-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 1, 1947, all of these areas — Hollidays Cove, Marland Heights, Weirton Heights, and unincorporated Weirton — merged and formed the city of Weirton as it currently exists. Thomas E. Millsop, the head of the Weirton Steel division of the other Ernest T. Weir company, [[National Steel Corporation]], was elected as the city's first mayor. The city charter was approved by voters in 1950.

Also home to Weirton is the Weirton Steel Corporation which was once a fully integrated [[steel mill]] employing over 12,000 people. It was the largest private employer and the largest taxpayer in West Virginia. This is no longer true. Due to reorganization of the steel industry, not only within the United States but worldwide, the Weirton plant, now part of the international giant [[Arcelor Mittal]], currently operates only the [[tin-plating]] section of the mill (though still one of the country's largest tin-plate makers), with only 1,200 workers. During the early 1980s the employees of Weirton Steel endeavored to purchase the mill from [[National Steel Corporation]] as the largest [[Employee Stock Ownership Program|ESOP]] (Employee Stock Ownership Program) in the nation, saving the mill from bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Some civic leaders are attempting to attract businesses and homeowners from the neighboring [[Pittsburgh metropolitan area]], marketing Weirton as a [[bedroom community]], taking advantage of the close proximity to the [[Pittsburgh International Airport]] and major interstates.

Weirton is home to a number of sites on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] including: [[Johnston-Truax House]], [[Marland Heights Park and Margaret Manson Weir Memorial Pool]], [[People's Bank (Weirton, West Virginia)|People's Bank]], [[Dr. George Rigas House]], and the [[Peter Tarr Furnace Site]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nris&quot;&gt;{{NRISref|version=2009a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
The city of Weirton is located at {{coord|40|25|N|80|35|W|type:city}} (40.41, &amp;minus;80.58).{{GR|1}} It extends from the [[Ohio]] border on the west to the [[Pennsylvania]] border on the east at a point where the northern extension of West Virginia is five miles across. Therefore, it is the only city in the [[United States]] that borders two other states on two sides, and its own state on the other two sides.

Weirton is across the [[Ohio River]] from [[Steubenville, Ohio|Steubenville]], Ohio, and about 35 miles west of [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]], along U.S. Route 22. [[Pittsburgh International Airport]] is less than 30 miles away. With the opening of the Findlay Connector (PA Turnpike 576, future I-576) in October, 2006, the highway distance to the airport has decreased to about 20 miles.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|19.26|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which, {{convert|18.05|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|1.21|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.&lt;ref name =&quot;Gazetteer files&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2013-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2011, the city and its two counties had attracted the attention of the ''New York Times'' which noted the town was dwindling in population. The article reported that Brooke County had just 71 live births for every 100 deaths and that Hancock County was in similar straits. This has led, the article claimed, to a reduction in civic institutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/07/us/07aging.html?hp=&amp;pagewanted=all, &quot;With Death Outpacing Birth, a County Slows to a Shuffle&quot;, by Sabrina Tavernise and Robert Gebeloff, New York Times], 7 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===18th century===
[[Charles Washington]], the founder of Charles Town, was born in [[Hunting Creek]], now [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]], [[Virginia]] on May 2, 1738. He was the youngest full brother of [[George Washington]]. He came to present Jefferson County between April and October 1780. 
[[Image:HappyRetreat CharlesTownWV.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Happy Retreat]]
The estate of Charles Washington, [[Happy Retreat]], was erected in 1780. In 1786, on 80 acres (320,000 m²) of his adjoining land, Charles laid out the streets of Charles Town,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ambler|first=Charles Henry|title=George Washington and the West|url=http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=pitttext;cc=pitttext;xc=1;idno=00agb5351m;g=pitttextall;type=simple;q1=ohio%20company;submit=Search;didno=00agb5351m;rgn=full%20text;view=image;seq=0048|work=Historic Pittsburgh Text Collection|publisher=University of Pittsburgh|accessdate=20 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; naming many of them after his brothers and one after his wife, Mildred. He donated the four corner lots at the intersection of George and Washington Streets for public buildings of the town and county, provided the town become the seat of the county separated from [[Berkeley County, West Virginia|Berkeley County]]. Charles Town was officially chartered by the Virginia General Assembly in January 1787.		

In 1794, James Madison married &quot;Dolly&quot; Todd at Harewood, the home of George Steptoe Washington, son of Colonel Samuel Washington, just outside of Charles Town.

===19th century===
Jefferson County was formed in 1801 as Charles Washington had anticipated. The county court house stands on one of the lots he donated, as did the jail until 1919 when it was demolished to be replaced by the post office.

Charles Washington died sometime between July and September, 1799, only a short while before the death of his brother George. Charles' and his wife Mildred's grave sites near Evitts Run have recently been located and surrounded by a stone wall.

In 1844, the first issue of the Spirit of Jefferson newspaper was published in Charles Town by James W. Beller. It is still published as the Spirit of Jefferson-Advocate, making it one of the oldest newspapers in the state.

On October 16, 1859, [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] and his followers raided the Federal arsenal at nearby Harpers Ferry. The insurrection was ultimately put down and John Brown was tried for treason. On December 2, 1859, he was hanged in Charles Town at the [[Gibson-Todd House]], which is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

In 1883, the Valley Telephone Company was incorporated in West Virginia and began installing telephone lines throughout Jefferson County. The company's main office was in Charles Town.

===20th century===
In 1922, William Blizzard, a leader of striking coal miners, was charged with treason and murder for engaging in warfare against state and federal troops in Mingo and Logan counties. He was tried in the Jefferson county courthouse in Charles Town and was found not guilty.

The [[Hollywood Casino at Charles Town Races|Charles Town Race Track]] first opened in 1933. It was built on land purchased from the Charles Town Horse Show Association.

In 1975, the new Jefferson Memorial Hospital opened, replacing the old Charles Town General Hospital. It is now part of the West Virginia University Hospitals (WVUH-East) chain of health care facilities, and was renamed Jefferson Medical Center in 2013.

In 1999, the Charles Town Race Track underwent major renovation which included a large addition to house video slot machines. It was renamed Charles Town Races &amp; Slots and now attracts many visitors each week from the nearby Baltimore and Washington D.C. metropolitan areas.

===21st century===
In 2006, a non-profit corporation, called the Friends of Happy Retreat, Inc. (FOHR), purchased an option to buy the former home of Charles Washington outright.  The goal of this group is to see Happy Retreat preserved as a national historic treasure while at the same time contributing to the public’s appreciation of the arts, local culture, and the rich history of the Washington family and the Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia.  FOHR hosts a special tour of Happy Retreat along with other Washington Family Homes during the annual Charles Town Heritage Festival which occurs the third Saturday of September. The Gavin family, the current owners of Happy Retreat, have placed the mansion on the market to sell.

In 2011, Discover Downtown Charles Town (DDCT) was founded with a mission to preserve, promote and enhance the physical, social, cultural and economic vitality of Charles Town’s historic downtown center with an unwavering commitment to its growth and sustainability.  The organization is part on the West Virginia ONTRAC program which is a precursor to joining the West Virginia Main Street Program.  Currently DDCT is applying for  nonprofit 501(c)3 status and is an all volunteer run organization.  DDCT volunteers work closely with local governments and merchants to put on events, create programs to support business owners and improve the design of Historic Downtown Charles Town.

==Place name lore==
Two differing stories tell of the naming of Ravenswood.  One story tells that the town was originally named Ravensworth, after the English relatives of a founding family.  But somewhere between the Ohio River wilderness and the mapmaker in Richmond, the name was changed to Ravenswood.  The second story says that Henrietta Fitzhugh, wife of one of the town founders, Henry Fitzhugh, named the town after the hero in [[Walter Scott]]'s novel ''[[The Bride of Lammermoor]]'' (1819).&lt;ref name=house/&gt;

'''Kenova''' is a city in [[Wayne County, West Virginia|Wayne County]], [[West Virginia]], at the [[confluence]] of the [[Ohio River|Ohio]] and [[Big Sandy River (Kentucky-West Virginia)|Big Sandy]] Rivers.  The name of the town comes from its unique position where the borders of Kentucky, Ohio, and West Virginia meet.  Founded in 1859 but not incorporated until 1894, the town's early history and development was centered around the railroad industry.  It is home to a major [[Norfolk Southern Bridge (Kenova, West Virginia)|Norfolk Southern Ohio River Bridge]].  [[CSX Transportation]]'s former [[Chesapeake and Ohio Railway|Chesapeake and Ohio]] Kanawha Subdivision travels through the town as well.

The population was 3,216 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. Kenova is a part of the [[Huntington-Ashland, WV-KY-OH, Metropolitan Statistical Area]] (MSA). As of the 2010 census, the MSA had a population of 287,702. New definitions from February 28, 2013 placed the population at 363,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/bulletins/2013/b13-01.pdf|title=Population statistics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city is also near the site of the [[Southern Airways Flight 932]] aviation disaster.  In 1970, a plane carrying the [[Marshall University]] football team crashed on a hillside on approach to the [[Tri-State Airport]], killing all on board.  A movie about the tragedy, [[We Are Marshall]], was released in 2006.

==Education==
Since the closing of Ceredo-Kenova and Buffalo-Wayne High Schools in 1998, Kenova Elementary is the lone public education facility within Kenova city limits. The school has been awarded multiple national blue ribbons in academic achievement. Buffalo Elementary and Buffalo Middle schools are also located near Kenova, but just outside city limits. The former Ceredo-Kenova High School, locally known as &quot;C-K,&quot; boasted a great number of athletic state championships, including 12 in football, one in cheerleading and in 1995 won their only WV State Class A Region 4 Baseball championship. Buffalo can credit championships in boys' and girls' basketball and in football to their accomplishments.  In 1998, Ceredo-Kenova and Buffalo-Wayne High Schools were closed and consolidated with Huntington, West Virginia based Vinson High School to form Spring Valley High School.

==Geography==
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|1.60|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which, {{convert|1.26|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.34|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.&lt;ref name =&quot;Gazetteer files&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2013-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dreamland Pool==
[[Dreamland Pool]], first opened in 1926, was once the largest swimming pool in the United States east of the [[Mississippi River]], measuring 250 feet by 125 feet.  The original construction included a three story pavilion that ran the length of the pool.  The top floor of the pavilion included a dance floor, where many notable Big Bands played though the 1930s and 1940s and attracted big names such as [[Benny Goodman]], [[Louis Armstrong]], and [[Frank Sinatra]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WSAZ&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsaz.com/newswestvirginia/headlines/19406174.html|accessdate=2008-07-03|author=WSAZ news|title=Dreamland Pool Opens Saturday|quote=One local pool in our region is now on the road to a comeback after nearly closing.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A fire in the 1972 destroyed the pavilion, but the rest of the facility survived.  The pool was conveyed to the City of Kenova in 1973.  Presently, the Kenova Parks &amp; Recreation Board oversees the operation and management of the facility.  About the size of a football field, Dreamland sports two cement floats equidistant from each other in the middle of the pool to allow swimmers a place to rest.  Dreamland Pool was recently renovated in 2008.

==The Pumpkin House==
The 1891 Victorian home located at 748 Beech Street is listed on the National Registry of Historic Places and was once visited by President Grover Cleveland. In recent years it has become known as The Pumpkin House, because of the more than 3000 hand-carved Jack-o-Lanterns which owner Ric Griffith, the town's mayor and pharmacist, adorn it with each Halloween season.  The Pumpkin House has received national media attention and has been featured on segments of NBC's The Today Show, The Ellen DeGeneres Show, and many other media outlets. Pumpkin house owner Ric Griffith is also longtime owner of the Griffith and Feil Drug Store, an old time drug store with an authentic early 20th century soda fountain which he has totally restored. His father, longtime Kenova businessman and resident Dick Griffith, worked in the pharmacy on a semi-retirement basis for many years until he was in his early 90s. He also sponsored a tennis tournament which bears his name in nearby Huntington.

==Name==
There is some disagreement concerning the origin of the city's name.  A family with the Scottish surname Buckhannon was found in the town until recently, and with most of the residents being of Scottish heritage this seems to be a logical explanation. Some still suggest, however, that the city's name is an Anglicized version of the [[Lenape]] chief Buck-on-ge-ha-non, whom was known to be in the area of Fort Pitt (modern day Pittsburgh). His son was said to have been killed nearby in a historical fiction{{clarify|date=November 2013}}, and a memorial to them is in a downtown park.

Historians think it more likely that the community and river were both named for John Buchannon, a missionary to the area in the 1780s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.polsci.wvu.edu/wv/Upshur/upshistory.html &quot;Upshur County History&quot;], West Virginia University&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The European-American history of Upshur County begins with the settling of the Buckhannon River Valley. The brothers [[Samuel and John Pringle]] were English soldiers serving in the [[French and Indian War]] ([[Seven Years' War]]) who in 1761 deserted their post at [[Fort Pitt (Pennsylvania)|Fort Pitt]] (present-day Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania). They traveled southward and upstream along the [[Monongahela River|Monongahela]] and [[Tygart Valley River|Tygart Valley]] rivers, continuing up what is now called the Buckhannon River. They were said to arrive in present-day [[Upshur County, West Virginia|Upshur County]] in 1764 and took up living in a huge hollow of an [[American sycamore]]. They lived there for 3 years, living off game and fish. Finally one went out for more ammunition and found the war was over. After his return, they moved to the South Branch settlements.  John later went to Kentucky, but Samuel returned to the river valley with his new wife Charity Pringle (née Cutright), her brother John Jr., friends Thomas Hughes, and John and Elizabeth Jackson with their sons George and Edward.

The City of Buckhannon was established on January 15, 1816, named after the river.  Some accounts say both are named for ; others that they are named after an early missionary John Buckhannon.  The city was chartered by the [[Virginia General Assembly]] in 1852. Buckhannon was part of the Commonwealth of [[Virginia]] until the secession of West Virginia on June 20, 1863 during the [[American Civil War]]. Because of its near-central geographic location, Buckhannon was long considered as a prospective site for the capital. In 1866, the legislature approved a bill including Buckhannon among the choices for capital, but officials decided the river was not wide enough to accommodate desired commerce. 

The first courthouse was built in 1854. It also served as an opera house and town hall. Electricity was installed in 1891 to replace oil lamps. The building suffered fire damage in the first six months of electrical service.  It was razed in 1898. In its place, a Classical Revival style courthouse, designed by Charleston architect [[Harrison Albright]], was begun in 1899 and completed in 1901. It is still in use today. An annex of the same style was added in 1995. In the cornerstone of the main building is a time capsule filled with turn of the 19th century artifacts.

The [[Sago Mine Disaster]], January 2, 2006, killed 12 and left one survivor.  Officials said that a [[lightning strike]] in the [[coal]] caused the explosion. It was the worst [[mining disaster]] in the US since a 2001 disaster in [[Alabama]] killed 13 people, and the worst disaster in West Virginia since a 1968 incident that killed 78 people. National and international news crews were in the area for about three to four days to cover rescue and recovery efforts.

'''Philippi''' (pronounced 'FILL-uh-pea') is a city in — and the [[county seat]] of — [[Barbour County, West Virginia|Barbour County]], [[West Virginia]], USA.{{GR|6}} The population was 2,966 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. In 1861, the city was the site of the [[Battle of Philippi (West Virginia)|Battle of Philippi]], known as &quot;The Philippi Races&quot;. Although a minor skirmish, this is considered the earliest notable land action of the [[American Civil War]].

Philippi is the home of [[Alderson Broaddus University]], a four-year liberal-arts college affiliated (until recently) with the [[American Baptist Churches]]. 

The city has a weekly [[newspaper]], ''[[The Barbour Democrat]]''.

==Geography==
[[Image:PhilippiWV1.jpg|thumb|320px|left|Philippi, West Virginia, USA, from across the [[Tygart Valley River]]. The view includes the [[Philippi Historic District]] and the [[Barbour County Courthouse]] (just right of center).]]

Philippi is located along the [[Tygart Valley River]] at {{coord|39|9|6|N|80|2|36|W|type:city}} (39.151569, -80.043472){{GR|1}}. It is within [[Philippi District, Barbour County, West Virginia|Philippi District]] — one of eight [[magisterial district]]s of Barbour County. The town is sub-divided into Wards 1 through 4.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|2.95|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which, {{convert|2.86|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.09|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.&lt;ref name =&quot;Gazetteer files&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2013-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original settlement that became the town of Philippi was on a section of bottomland at a bend in the river at the mouth of Anglin's Run. (This area was later designated &quot;Dayton Park&quot;.) Opposite this bottomland, at the western landing of &quot;Booth's Ferry&quot;, is a sharp ridge which breaks abruptly down to the river and is still known as &quot;Nobusiness Hill&quot;. Most of the town is located in the bottomland, but a portion, including the college campus, is on another ridge — &quot;Battle Hill&quot; — overlooking the valley from the northwest.

A railroad line runs through Philippi, now used only by [[freight train]]s, passenger rail service having been discontinued in 1956. (The passenger station is now a museum.) The town is served by the small, private [[Philippi-Barbour County Regional Airport]].

==Demographics==
===2010 census===
As of the [[census]]&lt;ref name =&quot;FactFinder&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=American FactFinder|url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2013-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; of 2010, there were 2,966 people, 1,185 households, and 686 families residing in the city.

The median income for a household in the city was $21,528, and the median income for a family was $31,473. Males had a median income of $27,262 versus $20,579 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the city was $12,176. About 21.9% of families and 30.7% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 39.0% of those under age 18 and 24.5% of those age 65 or over.

==History==
===Settlement, founding and naming===
The first white settlement in present-day [[Barbour County, West Virginia|Barbour County]] was established about 3 miles downriver from the future site of Philippi in 1780, at which time the area was still part of western [[Virginia]] and included within [[Monongalia County, West Virginia|Monongalia County]]. The earliest settlers on the section of bottomland that would one day become Philippi were William Anglin (as early as 1783 or '84) and Daniel Booth (1787). A [[Ford (crossing)|ford]] existed here as early as 1789 which served the road that had recently been surveyed between [[Beverly, West Virginia|Beverly]] and Sandy Creek. Anglin was the original owner of the land upon which Philippi stands, hence the earliest known name for the locality — Anglin's Ford. Booth also owned and operated a commercial [[ferry]] here from about 1800, thus the area's second popular designation — Booth's Ferry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Maxwell, Hu| title = The History of Barbour County, From its Earliest Exploration and Settlement to the Present Time, The Acme Publishing Company, Morgantown, W.Va. (Reprinted, McClain Printing Company, Parsons, W.Va., 1968)|year = 1899| pages = 276}}&lt;/ref&gt; William Friend Wilson married Booth's daughter and built a wool and grain mill on the river in 1818.

In March 1843, the vast Monongalia County of western Virginia was carved up into several smaller political units, among them Barbour County, which included Booth's Ferry. In 1899, [[Hu Maxwell]] described the April 1843 founding and official naming of the new county seat:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;The county seat of Barbour was located at the place where Philippi now stands before there was a town and before the place was named. It was then a farm belonging to William F. Wilson, and the locality had long been known as Booth's Ferry. The land was first the property of William Anglin, and in succession was owned by John Wilson, Daniel Booth, Ely Butcher, Elmore Hart, Thomas H. Hite and William F. Wilson, who divided it into lots and disposed of the most of it within a few years of the establishing of the county seat. The county was named after [the Virginia lawyer and jurist] [[Philip Pendleton Barbour]], and it was the intention of the county court when it selected a name for the town to honor the given name of Mr. Barbour; giving it the feminine form, however, in conformity with the [[Latin language]]. The feminine of [[Philip (name)|Philip]] is [[Philippa]], and it was meant that such should be the name of the town. But because of misspellings and a misunderstanding of the origin of the name (confounding it with [[Philippi]], an ancient city) the name finally took the form which it now has. On April 5, 1843, the third day of the first county court, it is 'ordered that the county seat of this county be known and called PHILLIPPA'. Except that the name has too many 'l's' the form was proper, according to what was originally intended. Later the name became Philippi, but even then it was oftener misspelled than spelled correctly.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell, ''Op. cit.'', pg 279.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
As Maxwell implies, [[Paul of Tarsus|St Paul's]] ''[[Epistle to the Philippians]]'' and the ancient [[Battle of Philippi]] were no doubt influential in the final form of the name. Philippi was established by charter in 1844.

In 1852 [[Lemuel Chenoweth]], an Appalachian [[architect]] and [[carpenter]], built a [[covered bridge]] in Philippi to provide a link on the [[Toll roads in the United States#History, funding through toll|turnpike]] running between [[Beverly, West Virginia|Beverly]] and [[Fairmont, West Virginia|Fairmont]]. The [[Philippi Covered Bridge]] spelled the end of the commercial ferry operation and is still the town's prominent landmark.

===Civil War===
{{main|Battle of Philippi (West Virginia)}}
Philippi was the scene of the first land battle of the [[American Civil War]], on June 3, 1861. The battle was promptly lampooned as the &quot;Philippi Races&quot; because of the hurried retreat by the Confederate troops encamped in the town. The battle is [[American Civil War reenactment|reenacted]] every June during the town's 'Blue and Gray Reunion.'

At daylight on June 3, two columns of Union forces under the command of Col. [[Benjamin Franklin Kelley]] and Col. [[Ebenezer Dumont]], with perhaps 3,000 men, arrived from [[Grafton, West Virginia|Grafton]] and attacked about 800 poorly armed [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] recruits under the command of Col. [[George A. Porterfield]]. The Union troops had marched all night through a heavy rain storm to arrive just before daylight. The surprise attack — from the heights of &quot;Battle Hill&quot; to the northwest — awakened the sleeping Confederates. After firing a few shots at the advancing Union troops, the Southerners broke lines and began running frantically to the south, some still in their bed clothes.

The Union victory in a relatively bloodless battle propelled the young [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[George B. McClellan]] into the national spotlight, and he was soon be given command of all Union armies. The battle also inspired more vocal protests in the Western part of Virginia against secession. A few days later in [[Wheeling, West Virginia|Wheeling]], the [[Wheeling Convention]] nullified the Virginia ordinance of secession and named [[Francis H. Pierpont]] governor. These events eventually resulted in the separate statehood of West Virginia.

===Later history===
Philippi was [[incorporation (municipal government)|incorporated]] by act of the [[West Virginia Legislature]] on 1 February 1871. The first railroad — the Grafton and Greenbrier, a [[Narrow gauge railway|narrow gauge]] — arrived at Philippi on 25 January 1884. Three years later the line was extended to Belington and in 1891 it became a [[standard gauge]] when it was acquired by the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad|B&amp;O]]. Rail activity at Philippi peaked in the 1920s when as many as six passenger trains, along with mail and freight, transited the town daily. The automobile brought about a decline in the railroad, however, and the final passenger train made its last stop in town in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;Mattaliano, Jane K. and Lois G. Omonde (1994), ''Milestones: A Pictorial History of Philippi, West Virginia, 1844-1994'', [[Virginia Beach, Virginia]]: [[The Donning Company Publishers]], pg. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1901, Broaddus College (founded in 1871 in [[Clarksburg, West Virginia]]) relocated to &quot;Battle Hill&quot;, overlooking Philippi. In 1932, Broaddus merged with Alderson Academy (itself founded in 1901 in [[Alderson, West Virginia]]), whereupon these two Baptist institutions became Alderson–Broaddus College, which changed its name to the current &quot;Alderson Broaddus University&quot; in 2013.

In 1905 a new Barbour County courthouse was completed. It was designed by J. Charles Fulton in a monumental [[Romanesque Revival]] style. The building contractor was J.P. Conn.

Throughout its history, Philippi has suffered from [[floods]] because of its proximity to the river and the relatively low elevation of most of the town. The most damaging of these came in November 1985. The town has since adopted a [[flood plain]] management plan.

Four miners from Barbour County were killed in the [[Sago Mine disaster|2006 Sago mine disaster]], three of whom were from Philippi.

==Economy==
Philippi's [[economy]] was originally based on [[coal mining]] and the [[railroad]] industry, but both have declined severely since the mid-20th century. The town's major employers now include Alderson-Broaddus University and [[Broaddus Hospital]]. Many inhabitants work in the [[service industry]], education, and family farming.

The city government provides many services and jobs to stimulate the local economy, including water, electric, digital cable, internet, garbage collection, and waste water treatment facilities. In addition, a professional police and volunteer fire department are provided. The City of Philippi was voted as a 2004 &quot;All American City&quot;.

==Notable residents==
* [[Ann Jarvis|Ann Maria Reeves Jarvis]] (1832–1905), [[activism|social activist]] who — along with her daughter [[Anna Jarvis|Anna Marie Jarvis]] (1864–1948) — is credited with founding [[Mother's Day (United States)|Mother's Day]], lived in Philippi for several years, both before and after her 1850 marriage.
* Actor [[Ted Cassidy]] (1932–79), who played [[Lurch (The Addams Family)|Lurch]] and &quot;[[Thing (Addams Family)|Thing]]&quot; on the 1960s TV show ''[[The Addams Family (TV series)|The Addams Family]]'', was raised in Philippi, graduating from Philippi High School ''circa'' 1950{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}.
* Scott Mayle, ex-[[National Football League|NFL]] player. Born and raised in Philippi, he played football for Philip Barbour, Ohio University, and finally the NFL.{{what|date=April 2012}}

==Sites of interest==
* The [[Philippi Covered Bridge]] (1852) is located at the junction of [[U.S. Route 250|U.S. Routes 250]] and [[U.S. Route 119|119]] in downtown Philippi. The bridge is notable for its use during the first land battle of the Civil War. This is the only &quot;twin-barreled&quot; covered bridge located on a federal highway in the United States and it is also one of the longest covered bridges in the country.
* The [[Philippi B &amp; O Railroad Station|Barbour County Historical Museum]], located in the [[Philippi B &amp; O Railroad Station|former railway station]], displays artifacts from throughout the region's history, with a particular focus on the 19th century. By far the most famous of these are the [[Philippi mummies]], the bodies of two female asylum inmates that were artificially preserved in 1888 by local doctor Graham Hamrick, who was interested in [[mummy|mummification]] techniques.
* &quot;Campbell Schoolhouse&quot;, [[one-room school]] preserved on the Alderson-Broaddus campus.
* Unusually for a town of its size and location, Philippi is home to a [[Maronite]] [[hermit]]age, Our Lady of Solitude.

'''Ranson''' (formerly '''Corporation of Ranson''') is a city in [[Jefferson County, West Virginia|Jefferson County]], [[West Virginia]], [[United States]]. The population was 4,440 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].  Although the [[United States Census Bureau|Census Bureau]] listed it as a town in 2000, it is classified (along with all other municipalities with populations between two and ten thousand) as a city by state law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legis.state.wv.us/WVCODE/Code.cfm?chap=08&amp;art=1 §8-1-3] of the [[West Virginia Code]], accessed 2008-11-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Charles Town Mining, [[Manufacturing]], and Improvement Company played an instrumental role in creating this new town. In 1890, the company bought 850 acres (3.4&amp;nbsp;km²) adjoining the western and northern corporate limits of [[Charles Town, West Virginia|Charles Town]] and commissioned D.G. Howell, a civil engineer and architect, to lay out the town. The largest tract of land purchased was from the Ranson family. The Corporation of Ranson in Jefferson County, West Virginia, was officially incorporated in 1910 when residents decided to form their own town by a vote of 67-2.&lt;ref name=&quot;cityofransonwv.net&quot;&gt;http://cityofransonwv.net/visitorstourism/ranson-history.html&lt;/ref&gt; It was named in honor of Dr. James Ranson, a dentist and farmer living in the area.

The early growth and development of Ranson reflects the late 19th century boom of the [[Shenandoah Valley]] and surrounding areas associated with the rise of the railroads, mining, and manufacturing. Early photographs of Ranson show the offices of the Charles Town Mining, Manufacturing &amp; Improvement Company and the Hotel Powhatan, along with a few residential structures nearby. The community grew north from Lancaster Circle. Some of the companies that located in Ranson early on included the Hotel Powhatan, the Goetz Saddlery, the Shenandoah Brass and Iron Works, the Elemer E. Beachley Saw and Planing Mill, the John Farrin Boiler and Machine Shop, and the Vulcan Road Machine Company.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ranson 2010&quot;&gt;Ranson: A Centennial History by Bob O'Connor (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most significant structures to be constructed in Ranson was Hotel Powhatan. This four-story frame Queen Anne structure was located on {{convert|3.61|acre|m2}} on 3rd Avenue between Mildred and Preston. The building was designed by &quot;Baldwin and Pennington, Architects&quot; and was built by local contractor, Julius C. Holmes, for $46,500. The hotel opened in October 1891, but by 1900 it had become the Powhatan College for Young Women. In 1913, the college closed and in 1915 it re-opened as St. Hilda's Hall for Girls, a Christian school opened by the Episcopal Diocese under the direction of Maria Pendleton Duval. In 1921, a dormitory was added on property across the street from the original building. This new structure was known as Peterkin Hall and currently houses the offices of Amerigas. In 1931, with the stock market crash, the school closed and was converted into apartments. The original hotel structure burned to the ground on December 11, 1937.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ranson 2010&quot;/&gt;

In 1936, the town of Ranson purchased the former Charles Town Mining, Manufacturing &amp; Improvement Company office building from Mr. Getzendauner for $3,000 for the purposes of town hall. In 2003, the City began a multi-year renovation of the entire building, bringing it into the 21st Century. By 1941, Ranson's population was 1,171. Ranson continued to grow and by 1950, the population increased to 1,436. By 1970, the population again increased to 2,189. In 2000, Ranson had a population of 2,951. By 2010, the population was at 4,440, an increase of over 50% in just 10 years. In the 2000s the City Council saw a need to grow its tax and employment base after the unfortunate closings of AB&amp;C Corporation, Dixie Narco and Kidde Fire (Badger Powhatan) and take advantage of the commercial development opportunities along the West Virginia Route 9 four-lane bypass north of Ranson. Thus, the Council annexed several thousand acres, which now host commercial, residential and agricultural uses.&lt;ref name=&quot;cityofransonwv.net&quot;/&gt;

Today, as Ranson celebrates its centennial, the City is transitioning from a small industrial town, which boomed in the late 19th Century, to a community that blends major corporations with quiet residential neighborhoods and a developing commercial district. Many of the homes date from the turn of the century and reflect styles of that era. Most are unassuming, vernacular, frame or brick, single family, two-story dwellings or one-story cottages. Newer one-story homes, townhouses and apartment complexes have been built on vacant lots throughout Ranson with most new development being on the western and northern boundaries along the Route 9 four-lane bypass.

As in the beginning, Ranson continues to host and welcome business and industry to the community. With the construction and opening of the $425,000 Jefferson Memorial Hospital on October 3, 1948, Ranson began to develop a medical community with many doctors opening offices in and around the hospital.   On April 22, 1975, Jefferson Memorial opened its current facility on Preston Street between 3rd and 5th Avenues at a cost of $4.5 million. The current facility continues to serve the residents of Jefferson County. Just outside the limits of Ranson, but extremely important to the community's economy is Hollywood Casino at Charles Town Races. This facility provides employment to over 1200 individuals and generates millions of dollars of taxes to Jefferson County and its municipalities for capital improvements. Thanks, in part, to these proceeds, which began flowing in 2004, the City has been able to purchase police cars and equipment, complete the Mildred Street streetscape project in 2007 adding sidewalks, curb, gutter and benches; renovate and construct parks; and renovate City Hall.&lt;ref name=&quot;cityofransonwv.net&quot;/&gt;

In 2004, the Potomac Marketplace and surrounding the residential subdivisions of Lakeland Place and Shenandoah Springs broke ground and opened. The Marketplace, when completely built, is intended to be a {{convert|1500000|sqft|m2}} commercial development and includes national retailers and restaurants such as Home Depot, Kohl's, Weis Markets, McDonalds, Chick-Fil-A and Petco.

Ranson is governed by a Mayor, Recorder and five-member City Council, who each serve four-year staggered terms. The City employs a City Manager who is appointed by Council to serve as the administrative head of government. The City is a fully functioning government with the Ranson Police Department providing 24 hour per day, seven days a week protection to the City's citizens. City Hall is staffed with a Planning and Zoning department, Public Works department, Finance department and Legal department to carry out the functions of government and provide services to the residents of the City. Two volunteer fire departments, Independent Fire Company and Citizens Fire Company, serve the City and provide it with fire protection. Additionally, the City has its own municipal court system.

'''Keyser''' is a city in and the [[county seat]] of [[Mineral County, West Virginia|Mineral County]]{{GR|6}}, [[West Virginia]], [[United States]]. It is part of the [[Cumberland, MD-WV Metropolitan Statistical Area]]. The population was 5,439 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].

== History ==
{{unreferenced|section, except for a single footnote,|date=October 2013}}
Keyser was originally called Paddy Town after Patrick McCarty, son of one of the original settlers. With the coming of the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] in 1852, the destiny of the area changed from a quiet rural community to a thriving industrial center. The name was changed to New Creek Station and then to [[New Creek]]. In 1861 the Civil War came rumbling through the valley. Fort Fuller was built on the present site of [[Potomac State College of West Virginia University|Potomac State College]], and Fort Piano entrenchments were established on New Creek Mountain. Because of the importance of the railroad, the town changed hands 14 times.

When [[West Virginia]] became a state in 1863, there was some contention between [[Piedmont, West Virginia|Piedmont]] and New Creek over the location of the county seat. As an inducement to have the county seat located in New Creek, the Davis brothers donated land for the courthouse in 1867.

In 1874, the town was incorporated as Keyser after [[William Keyser]], vice president of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad.

The [[Thomas R. Carskadon House]] and [[Mineral County Courthouse (Keyser, West Virginia)|Mineral County Courthouse]] are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nris&quot;&gt;{{NRISref|version=2010a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The schools in Keyser include Fountain Primary School, which covers Pre-Kindergarten through Fourth Grade; Keyser Middle School, which covers sixth through Eighth Grade; Keyser High School, which covers Ninth through Twelfth Grades; Mineral County Alternative School; and the Mineral County Tech Center, a vocational school.

'''Martinsburg''' is a city in and the [[county seat]] of [[Berkeley County, West Virginia|Berkeley County]], [[West Virginia]], [[United States]],{{GR|6}} in the state's the [[Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia|Eastern Panhandle]] region. Its population was 17,227 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]] making it the largest city in the Eastern Panhandle and the ninth largest municipality in the state. Martinsburg is one of the core cities in the [[Hagerstown Metropolitan Area|Hagerstown-Martinsburg, MD-WV Metropolitan Statistical Area]].

==History==
Martinsburg was founded in 1778 by General [[Adam Stephen]] who named it in honor of Colonel [[Thomas Bryan Martin]], a nephew of [[Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron]].

[[Aspen Hall (Martinsburg, West Virginia)|Aspen Hall]] is a Georgian mansion, the oldest part of which was built in 1745 by Edward Beeson, Sr. making it the oldest house in the city. Aspen Hall and the people who lived there played important roles in the agricultural, religious, transportation, and political heritage of the region. Significant events related to the British, French, and Indian War; the Revolution, and the Civil War took place on the property. Three original buildings are still standing including the rare blockhouse of Colonel Boober's Fort.

The first post office in what is now West Virginia was established at Martinsburg in 1792.

The Baltimore and Ohio (B&amp;O) Railroad reached Martinsburg in 1842. The B&amp;O Roundhouse and Station Complex was first constructed in 1849.

According to William Still, &quot;The Father of the Underground Railroad,&quot; a freedom-seeking slave made an interesting escape from Martinsburg on the Underground Railroad, Christmas night, 1856. Robert Brown, alias Thomas Jones, fled by riding a horse while it swam across the freezing Potomac River. After riding forty miles, he walked in cold wet clothes for two days, to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. He received assistance there, and then went by train to Philadelphia, and the office of William Still with the Pennsylvania Anti-Slavery Society. Brown's wife and four children had been sold, and all he had was a likeness of his wife, and locks of hair from each of them.

In 1854, ten-year-old Isabelle &quot;Belle&quot; Boyd, later a famous spy for the Confederacy, moved to Martinsburg with her family, where her father Benjamin opened and operated a general merchandise store. After the Civil War began, Benjamin joined Second Virginia Infantry, which was part of the Stonewall Brigade. As a result, his wife Mary was in charge of the Boyd home when Union forces under General Robert Patterson took Martinsburg. When a group of Patterson's men tried to raise a Union flag over the Boyd home, Mary refused. One of the soldiers, Frederick Martin, threatened Mary, and Belle promptly shot him. Although acquitted of wrongdoing in the matter, she soon became involved in espionage, sending information to Confederate generals Thomas &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson and J.E.B. &quot;Jeb&quot; Stuart. Often she was helped by Eliza Corsey, a Boyd family slave whom Belle had taught to read and write. In 1863, Belle was arrested in Martinsburg by the Union Army and imprisoned. The Greek Revival home that Benjamin Boyd had built in 1853, and which he had sold in 1855, was purchased in 1992 by the Berkeley County Historical Society. The historical society renovated the building and now operates it as the Berkeley County Museum, also known as the Belle Boyd House.

The city of Martinsburg was incorporated by an act of the [[West Virginia Legislature]] on March 30, 1868.

The [[Great Railroad Strike of 1877]] began July 14, 1877 in Martinsburg and spread nationwide.

Telephone service first began in Martinsburg in 1883.

In 1889, electricity began to be furnished to Martinsburg as part of a franchise granted to the United Edison Manufacturing Company of New York.

The Interwoven mills began operations in Martinsburg in 1891 and grew to be the largest manufacturer of men's hosiery in the world.

Construction of the &quot;Apollo Civic Theatre&quot; was completed in 1913.

Over one thousand (1,039) men from Berkeley County participated in World War I. Of these, forty-one were killed and twenty-one were wounded in battle. A monument to those who fell in battle was erected in 1925.

During World War II, the Newton D. Baker Hospital in Martinsburg treated thousands of soldiers wounded in the war. In 1946 this military hospital became a part of the Veterans Administration (VA). The VA Medical Center in Martinsburg is still in service providing care to United States veterans.

Beginning in the late 1940s and through the 1950s, many of the mills and factories operating in Martinsburg shut down and went out of business, dealing a major blow to the local economy.

==History==
[[Image:CivilWarCemetery LewisburgWV.jpg|thumb|left|Civil War cemetery, Lewisburg]]

Lewisburg is named after [[Andrew Lewis (American general)|Andrew Lewis]]. In 1751 Lewis, as a young surveyor, established a camp near the spring behind the present courthouse. This spring has been known as the Lewis Spring since that time. During [[Pontiac's Rebellion]] in 1763, [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] completely destroyed two of the early [[Europe]]an [[Human settlement|settlement]]s in [[Greenbrier County, West Virginia|Greenbrier County]], killing the men and carrying off the women and children. This raid virtually eliminated all of the earliest [[settler]]s in the county. The Native Americans were primarily [[Shawnee]]s, and (according to undocumented tradition) were led by the famous leader [[Hokoleskwa]], or [[Cornstalk]].

By 1770 a fortified encampment called Fort Savannah was established at the Lewis Spring. In 1774, [[John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore|Governor Dunmore]] of [[Virginia]] instructed then-Colonel Andrew Lewis to gather &quot;willing and able men&quot; to go to the great [[Kanawha River]] and stand against the Native American forces that were attacking the Greenbrier Valley. In what became known as [[Lord Dunmore's War]], over 1,490 men were assembled, some at [[Fort Pitt (Pennsylvania)|Fort Pitt]] at present-day [[Pittsburgh]], and others at Fort Union, on the site of present-day Lewisburg.  These recruits included Lewis’s brother Charles, and others which history books refer to as one of the most remarkable assemblages of [[frontier]] [[leader]]s in American history. Thirteen were men of [[politics|political]] and [[military]] [[Distinction (social)|distinction]]. Lewis's [[army]] marched down the [[New River (Kanawha River)|New]] and [[Kanawha River]]s to the [[Ohio River]], where they intended to cross over and invade the [[Ohio Country]], which was the home of the [[Shawnee]]s.  The Native Americans, led by Cornstalk, attempted to cut them off at the mouth of the Kanawha, where they fought an inconclusive battle that came to be known as the [[Battle of Point Pleasant]].&lt;ref&gt;({{cite book |author=Allan W. Eckert |title=The frontiersmen: a narrative |publisher=Jesse Stuart Foundation |location=Ashland, Ky |year=2001 |isbn=0-945084-90-0 |oclc= |doi=}}Pages 78, 98-99)&lt;/ref&gt;

Lewisburg was formally established in 1782 by an act of the [[Virginia General Assembly]].

To accommodate Virginians west of the mountains, several [[Virginia]] courts sat in Lewisburg, where [[Patrick Henry]] once successfully defended a client accused of murder. The town and the surrounding farms prospered and a number of [[spa]]s and [[resort]] [[hotel]]s were established at some of the outlying [[Spring (hydrosphere)|mineral spring]]s.

During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] a number of engagements were fought in and around Lewisburg. Several of the present buildings in town were used as hospitals and barracks by both sides in this conflict, and [[bullet]] marks can still be seen in some today. The Virginia Supreme Court [[library]], which was located in Lewisburg and served as the Greenbrier County Library until 2008, was used as a [[hospital]] and has preserved a section of wall with soldiers' [[graffiti]].

In 1978, a {{convert|236|acre|km2|sing=on}} area in the heart of Lewisburg was designated a [[National Register]] Historic District.

Today, Lewisburg is home to the [[West Virginia School of Osteopathic Medicine]], one of 29 [[Osteopathic medicine in the United States|osteopathic medical schools in the United States]] and one of three medical schools in West Virginia.

'''Beckley''' is a city and [[county seat]] of [[Raleigh County, West Virginia|Raleigh County]] located in [[West Virginia]], [[United States]]. It was founded on April 4, 1838.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wood&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= Raleigh County West Virginia|last= Wood |first= Jim |authorlink= |year= 1994|publisher= BJW Printing and Office Supplies|location= Beckley, WV |ISBN= |page=76 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beckley was named in honor of [[John J. Beckley|John James Beckley]], who was the first Clerk of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and the first [[Librarian of Congress]]. It was founded by his son [[Alfred Beckley]] (US Army general and [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] militia commander, born in [[Washington, D.C.]]). The current mayor since 1988 is Emmett S. Pugh, III.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.beckley.org/mayor_emmett_pugh.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Beckley WV Centennial Medal.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Beckley, West Virginia, Centennial Medal]]
Although founded in 1838, Beckley existed only on paper at that time, &quot;[[Alfred Beckley]] said he &quot;was frequently jeered and laughed at for his Paper Town...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wood, p.77&lt;/ref&gt; Early in its history, the town was known as '''Beckleyville''' and '''Raleigh Court House'''.  In 1850, &quot;The act of creating the county (Raleigh) made the town of Beckleyville the [[county seat]].&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= History of West Virginia|last= Lewis |first= Virgil |authorlink= |year= 1889|publisher= Hubbard Brothers, Publishers |location= Philadelphia, PA |ISBN=  |page= 708 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The city is sometimes called the &quot;Smokeless Coal Capital&quot;, &quot;The City of Champions&quot; and the &quot;Gateway To Southern West Virginia.&quot; Beckley had the first &quot;community antenna&quot; television system in the United States, a forerunner of cable television.{{cn|date = June 2013}}

==Geography and climate==
Beckley is located at {{coord|37.779764|-81.183193|type:city_region:US-WV|format=dms|display=inline}} (37.779764, −81.183193).{{GR|1}}

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|9.50|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which, {{convert|9.49|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.01|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.&lt;ref name =&quot;Gazetteer files&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2013-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to its elevation, the climate of Beckley is either classified as [[oceanic climate|mountain temperate]] or [[humid continental]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfb'' or ''Dfb'', respectively), and the city straddles the border between [[Hardiness zone|USDA Plant Hardiness Zone]]s 6B and 7A.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arborday.org/treeinfo/ZoneInfo.cfm?ZipCode=25801&amp;submit=Look+it+up%21]&lt;/ref&gt; Summers are warm and humid, although significantly cooler than low-elevation places within the state, with only one day of {{convert|90|°F|0}}+ highs annually, and winters are generally cold and snowy with occasional intervening warm periods and 10 nights of sub-{{convert|10|°F|0}} lows. Monthly mean temperatures range from {{convert|31.1|°F|1}} in January to {{convert|70.6|°F|1}} in July. Snowfall averages {{convert|61.4|in|cm|0}} per season and chiefly occurs from December to March, with some accumulation in April and November and May or October falls much rarer.

==History==

=== The Céloron Expedition (1749) ===
In the second half of 1749 the [[France|French]] explorer [[Pierre Joseph Céloron de Blainville]] claimed French sovereignty over the [[Ohio Valley]], burying a lead plaque at the meeting point of the Rivers Ohio and Kanawha, naming the place Point Pleasant.
  
The text on the plaque is as follows: 
:''L'AN 1749 DV REGNE DE LOVIS XV ROY DE FRANCE, NOVS CELORON, COMMANDANT D'VN DETACHEMENT ENVOIE PAR MONSIEVR LE MIS. DE LA GALISSONIERE, COMMANDANT GENERAL DE LA NOUVELLE FRANCE POVR RETABLIR LA TRAN QUILLITE DANS QUELQUES VILLAGES SAUVAGES DE CES CANTONS, AVONS ENTERRE CETTE PLAQUE AU CONFLUENT DE L'OHIO ET DE TCHADAKOIN CE 29 JVILLET, PRES DE LA RIVIERE OYO AUTREMENT BELLE RIVIERE, POUR MONUMENT DU RENOUVELLEMENT DE POSSESSION QUE NOUS AVONS PRIS DE LA DITTE RIVIERE OYO, ET DE TOUTES CELLE~ QUI Y TOMBENT, ET DE TOUTES LES TERRES DES DEUX COTES JVSQVE AVX SOURCES DES DITTES RIVIERES AINSI QV'EN ONT JOVY OU DV JOVIR LES PRECEDENTS ROIS DE FRANCE, ET QU'ILS S'Y SONT MAINTENVS PAR LES ARMES ET PAR LES TRAIT TES, SPECIALEMENT PAR CEVX DE RISWICK D'VTRECHT ET D'AIX LA CHAPELLE.''&lt;ref&gt;The Céloron Plate, one of only two to be recovered among the six placed by Céloron along the Ohio River during the expedition, is in the collections of the [[Virginia Historical Society]]. It was recovered in 1849 after washing out from the river bank; a monument marks the spot today.&lt;/ref&gt;

:''(in the year 1749, in the reign of [[King Louis XV]], we, Celeron, commander of a detachment sent by [[Roland-Michel Barrin de La Galissonière|Commander de La Galissonière]], Commander General of [[New France]], for the restoration of peace in various untamed villages in the region, have buried ed this plaque at the confluence of the Ohio and Tchadakoin [Rivers] this 29th day of July near the fine river bank, to commemorate the retaking into possession of the afore-mentioned river bank and all the surrounding lands on both river shores back to the river sources, as secured by previous kings of France, and maintained by force of arms and by treaties, specifically the Treaties of [[Treaty of Ryswick|Rijswick]], of [[Treaty of Utrecht|Utrecht]] and of [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Aix la Chapelle]]) ''

Céloron's expedition was a diplomatic failure since the local [[Native American tribes in Virginia|tribes]] remained pro-English, and English representatives in the region refused to go away. This was, therefore, ae prelude to a series of incidents that would lead to the loss of [[New France]] and the domination of eastern [[North America]] by the [[British Empire]] following the defeat of France in the [[French and Indian War]] (1754-1763). 

The expedition can nevertheless be seen in more positive terms as a geographical project, since the Céloron expedition was the starting point for the first map of the [[Ohio Valley]].  The map was the work of the [[Jesuit]] [[:fr:Joseph Pierre de Bonnecamps|Joseph Pierre de Bonnecamps]].

=== The Battle of Point Pleasant (1774) ===
{{main|Battle of Point Pleasant}}
In the [[Battle of Point Pleasant]] (October 10, 1774), fought on the future site of the town, over one thousand Virginia militiamen, led by Colonel [[Andrew Lewis (soldier)|Andrew Lewis]] (1720–1781), defeated a roughly equal force of an Algonquin confederation of [[Shawnee]] and [[Mingo]] warriors led by Shawnee Chief [[Cornstalk]] (''ca.'' 1720-1777). The event is celebrated locally as the &quot;First Battle of the [[American Revolutionary War]]&quot; and in 1908 the [[U.S. Senate]] authorized erection of a local monument to commemorate it as such. Most historians, however, regard it not as a battle of the Revolution (1775–1783), but as a part of [[Lord Dunmore's War]] (1774).

===Settlement===
&quot;Camp Point Pleasant&quot; was established by Col. Lewis at the time of the Battle and the settlement that followed also took that name. Although not certain, Point Pleasant may have been permanently settled by whites as early as 1774. A permanent stockade known as Fort Blair was erected there at about that time. Prior to that, hostilities between whites and Indians all along the [[Ohio River Valley]] probably precluded the possibility of settlement in the absence of a substantial stockade.&lt;ref&gt;Atkinson, George W. (1876), [http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~wvkanawh/Early/early.html ''History of Kanawha County, From its Organization in 1789 until the Present Time''], Office of the West Virginia Journal, [[Charleston, West Virginia]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1776, a new fort was built on the site of the earlier fort and named for the recently deceased Virginia official [[Peyton Randolph]] (1721–1775). [[Fort Randolph (West Virginia)|Fort Randolph]] is best remembered as the place where Chief Cornstalk was murdered in 1777. It withstood attack by Indians the following year, but was abandoned in 1779. It was rebuilt nearby in 1785 after the renewal of hostilities between the United States government and the Indians, but saw little action and was eventually abandoned once again.&lt;ref&gt;Two centuries later, a replica of the fort was built nearby.&lt;/ref&gt; The settlement at Point Pleasant did not receive an official charter until 1794.

===19th century===
Point Pleasant was incorporated in 1833.
{{expand section|date=June 2012}}

===20th century===
{{expand section|date=June 2012}}
Point Pleasant was widely noted for the 1967 collapse of the [[Silver Bridge]], which killed 46 people.

On 10 October 1974, Point Pleasant celebrated the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Point Pleasant. A replica of Fort Randolph was built in 1973-74 and dedicated as part of the festivities. The town of Point Pleasant was situated over the site of the fort and so the replica is located at Krodel Park, about one mile away.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pointpleasantwv.org/Parks&amp;Campgrounds/Local/Fort_Randolph/fort_randolph_restoration.htm Fort Randolph restoration], from [http://www.pointpleasantwv.org/Parks&amp;Campgrounds/Local/Fort_Randolph/Fort_Randolph_Hello.htm Fort Randolph website]&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Register of Historic Places===
The [[Eastham House]], [[Lewis-Capehart-Roseberry House]], and [[Point Pleasant Battleground]] are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].  The central business district and surrounding residential areas are included in the [[Point Pleasant Historic District (Point Pleasant, West Virginia)|Point Pleasant Historic District]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nris&quot;&gt;{{NRISref|version=2010a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable natives and residents==
*Point Pleasant was the final home of [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] Brigadier-General [[John McCausland]], the next-to-last Confederate General to die. He died at his farm at Grimm's Landing on January 23, 1927, and is buried in nearby [[Henderson, West Virginia|Henderson]].

==Folklore==

===The Mothman===
Paranormal enthusiasts flock to Point Pleasant in search of [[Mothman]], a creature said to be a harbinger of imminent disaster that inhabits an [[McClintic Wildlife Management Area|abandoned TNT factory]] from World War II. [[John A. Keel]] published a book in 1975 entitled ''[[The Mothman Prophecies]]'', and a [[The Mothman Prophecies (film)|film]] inspired by the novel was released in January 2002. The town is host to a Mothman Museum, and every year it holds a Mothman Festival that features tours, pageants, balls, films, music, and other events to celebrate what they consider &quot;one of Point Pleasant’s largest tourist attractions.&quot;&lt;ref name=DailyRegister&gt;{{cite news|last=Sergent|first=Beth|title=Mothman Festival to land Sept. 21-22|url=http://www.mydailyregister.com/news/home_top/2493284/Mothman-Festival-to-land-Sept.-21-22|accessdate=11 September 2013|newspaper=Daily Register}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Climate==
The climate in this area is characterized by relatively high temperatures and evenly distributed precipitation throughout the year.  According to the [[Köppen Climate Classification]] system, Point Pleasant has a [[Humid subtropical climate]], abbreviated &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=501764&amp;cityname=Point-Pleasant-West-Virginia-United-States-of-America Climate Summary for Point Pleasant, West Virginia]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charleston''' is the [[Capital (political)|capital]] and largest city of the [[U.S. state|State]] of [[West Virginia]]. It is located at the [[confluence]] of the [[Elk River (West Virginia)|Elk]] and [[Kanawha River|Kanawha]] Rivers in [[Kanawha County, West Virginia|Kanawha County]]. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 Census]], it had a population of 51,400, while its [[Charleston, West Virginia metropolitan area|metropolitan area]] had 304,214. New definitions from February 28, 2013 placed the population at 240,000.&lt;ref&gt;http://m.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/bulletins/2013/b13-01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Charleston, West Virginia metropolitan area|metropolitan area]] is the second-largest in West Virginia behind the [[Huntington-Ashland-Ironton metropolitan area|Huntington Metro Area]]. Charleston is the [[county seat]] of Kanawha County. It is the least populated state capital that is also the most populated city within the state.

Early industries important to Charleston included [[salt]] and the first [[natural gas]] well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wvexp.com/index.php/First_Natural_Gas_Well |title=First Natural Gas Well - West Virginia (WV) Cyclopedia |publisher=Wvexp.com |date=2005-12-10 |accessdate=2013-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later, [[coal]] became central to economic prosperity in the city and the surrounding area. Today, [[trade]], [[utilities]], [[government]], [[medicine]], and [[education]] play central roles in the city's economy.

The first permanent settlement, Ft. Lee, was built in 1788. In 1791, [[Daniel Boone]] was a member of the Kanawha County Assembly.

Charleston is the home of the [[West Virginia Power]] (formerly the Charleston Alley Cats and the Charleston Wheelers) [[minor league baseball]] team, the [[West Virginia Wild]] minor league basketball team, and the annual {{convert|15|mi|km|0|sing=on}} [[Charleston Distance Run]].  [[Yeager Airport]] and the [[University of Charleston]] are also located in the city.

Charleston is also home to the [[130th Airlift Wing]] of the [[West Virginia Air National Guard]].

The city also contains public parks, such as Cato Park and Coonskin Park, and the [[Kanawha State Forest]], a large public state park that sustains a pool, camping sites, several biking/walking trails, picnic areas, as well as several shelters provided for recreational use.

===Beginnings===
After the [[American Revolutionary War]], pioneers began making their way out from the early settlements. Many slowly migrated into the western part of [[Virginia]]. Capitalizing on its many resources made Charleston an important part of Virginia and West Virginia history. Today, Charleston is the largest city in the state and the state capital.

Charleston's history goes back to the 18th century. [[Thomas Bullitt]] was deeded {{convert|1250|acre|km2|0}} of land near the mouth of the [[Elk River (West Virginia)|Elk River]] in 1773.  It was inherited by his brother, [[Cuthbert Bullitt]], upon his death in 1782, and sold to Col. George Clendenin in 1786.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.city-data.com/us-cities/The-South/Charleston-History.html |title=Charleston: History |work=City-Data.com |publisher=Advameg, Inc. |accessdate=2009-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first permanent settlement, Fort Lee, was built in 1787 by Col. Savannah  Clendenin and his company of Virginia Rangers. This structure occupied the area that is now the intersection of Brooks Street and Kanawha Boulevard. Historical conjecture indicates that Charleston is named after Col. Clendenin's father, Charles. Charles Town was later shortened to Charleston to avoid confusion with another [[Charles Town, West Virginia|Charles Town]] in eastern West Virginia, which was named after George Washington's brother Charles.

Six years later, the [[Virginia General Assembly]] officially established Charleston. On the {{convert|40|acre|m2}} that made up the town in 1794, 35&amp;nbsp;people inhabited seven houses.

Charleston is part of [[Kanawha County]]. The origin of the word Kanawha (pronounced &quot;KA-NAW&quot;), &quot;Ka(h)nawha&quot;, derives from the region's Iroquois dialects meaning &quot;water way&quot; or &quot;Canoe Way&quot; implying the metaphor, &quot;transport way&quot;, in the local language. It was and is the name of the river that flows past Charleston. The grammar of the &quot;hard H&quot; sound soon dropped out as new arrivals of various European languages developed West Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;Kanawha County was named in honor of the Great Kanawha River that runs through the county. The River was named for the Indian tribe that once lived in the area. The spelling of the Indian tribe varied at the time from Conoys to Conois to Kanawha. The latter spelling was used and has gained acceptance over time. http://www.polsci.wvu.edu/wv/Kanawha/kanhistory.html (12-29-08)&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase has been a matter of [[Register (sociolinguistics)]]. In fact, a two-story jail was the first county structure ever built, with the first floor literally dug into the bank of the [[Kanawha River]].

[[Daniel Boone]], who was commissioned a lieutenant colonel of the Kanawha County militia, was elected to serve in 1791 in the [[Virginia House of Delegates]]. As told in historical accounts, Boone walked all the way to [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]].

===Industrial growth===
By the early 19th century, salt brines were discovered along the Kanawha River and the first [[salt well]] was drilled in 1806. This created a prosperous time and great economic growth for the area. By 1808, 1,250&amp;nbsp;pounds of salt were being produced a day. An area adjacent to Charleston, Kanawha Salines, now Malden, would become the top salt producer in the world. In 1818, Kanawha Salt Company, first trust in United States, went into operation.

Captain James Wilson, while drilling for salt, struck the first natural gas well in 1815. It was drilled at the site that is now the junction of Brooks Street and Kanawha Boulevard (near the present-day state capitol complex.) In 1817, [[coal]] was first discovered and gradually became used as the fuel for the salt works. The Kanawha salt industry declined in importance after 1861, until the advent of [[World War I]] brought a demand for chemical products. The chemicals needed were [[chlorine]] and [[sodium hydroxide]], which could be made from salt [[brine]].

===Political growth===
The town continued to grow until the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] began in 1861. The state of Virginia seceded from the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]], and Charleston was divided between Union and [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] loyalty. On September 13, 1862, the Union and Confederate Armies met in the [[Battle of Charleston (1862)|Battle of Charleston]]. Although the [[Confederate States Army]] was victorious, occupation of the city was short-lived. Union troops returned just six weeks later and stayed through the end of the war.

The Northern hold on Charleston and most of the western part of [[Virginia]] created an even larger problem. Virginia already had seceded from the Union, but the western part was under Union control. The issue of statehood was raised. So amid the tumultuous Civil War, West Virginia officially became a state through Presidential Proclamation. [[Abraham Lincoln]] declared the northwestern portion of Virginia to be returned to the Union, and on June 20, 1863, West Virginia became the 35th state.

In addition to the issue of slavery, West Virginia was also driven to separate from Virginia for economic reasons. The heavy industries in the North, particularly the [[steel]] business of the upper [[Ohio River]] region, were dependent on the [[coal]] available from western Virginia mines. Federalized military units were dispatched from Ohio to western Virginia early in the war to secure access to the coal mines and transportation resources.

Although the state now existed, settling on a state capital location proved to be difficult. For several years, the capital of West Virginia intermittently traveled between [[Wheeling, West Virginia|Wheeling]] and Charleston. In 1877, however, state citizens voted on the final location of their capital. Charleston received 41, 243 votes, Clarksburg received 29,442 and Martinsburg received 8,046.  Wheeling was not an available option for voting.  Charleston was chosen and eight years later, the first capitol building was opened.

After a fire in 1921, a hastily built structure was opened but burned down in 1927. However, a Capitol Building Commission, created by the Legislature in 1921, authorized construction of the [[West Virginia State Capitol|present capitol]]. Architect [[Cass Gilbert]] designed the buff [[Indiana limestone]] structure, in the [[Neo-Renaissance|Italian Renaissance]] style, that was to have a final cost of just under $10 million. After the three stages of construction were completed, Governor [[William G. Conley]] dedicated the [[West Virginia State Capitol]] on June&amp;nbsp;20, 1932.

===Development in the 1900s===
Charleston was now the center for state government. Natural resources, such as [[coal]] and [[natural gas]], along with [[railroad]] expansion also contributed to growth. New industries, such as chemical, [[glass]], [[timber]] and [[steel]] migrated to the state, attracted by the area's natural resources. There was a huge amount of new construction in Charleston. A number of those buildings, including churches and office buildings, still stand in the heart of downtown along and bordering Capitol Street.

During [[World War II]], the first and largest [[styrene-butadiene]] plant in the U.S. opened in nearby [[Institute, West Virginia|Institute]], providing a [[Synthetic rubber|replacement]] for [[Natural rubber|rubber]] to the war effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/science/341651/institute_and_wwii__creation_of_synthetic_rubber_plant_was/index.html |first=Clarence M. |last=Nelson |title=Institute and WWII: Creation of Synthetic Rubber Plant Was Exciting |publisher=redOrbit |date=2005-12-28 |accessdate=2009-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the war ended, Charleston was on the brink of some significant construction. One of the first during this period was Kanawha Airport (now [[Yeager Airport]], named after General [[Chuck Yeager]]), which was perhaps one of the most phenomenal engineering accomplishments of its time. Built in 1947, the construction encompassed clearing {{convert|360|acre|km2|1}} on three mountaintops moving more than nine million cubic yards of earth.

In 1959, the [[Charleston Civic Center]] opened its doors. It stands today, totally renovated and providing the largest meeting and exhibit space available in West Virginia.

In 1956, President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] signed the [[Federal Aid Highway Act]]. Charleston became part of that system in the 1960s when three major interstate systems—[[I-64]], [[I-77]] and [[I-79]] were constructed, all converging in the heart of Charleston. These roads provide convenient access to Midwestern, Northeastern and Southern cities. Charleston is within a day's drive of 60&amp;nbsp;percent of the U.S. population.

===Modern development===
In 1983, the [[Charleston Town Center]] opened its doors downtown. It was the largest urban-based mall east of the [[Mississippi River]], featuring three stories of shops and eateries. Downtown revitalization began in earnest in the late 1980s as well. Funds were set aside for streetscaping as Capitol and Quarrier Streets saw new building facades, trees along the streets, and brick walkways installed. For a time, the opening of the Charleston Town Center Mall had a somewhat negative impact on the main streets of downtown Charleston, as many businesses closed and relocated into the mall.  For a while, the downtown business district (outside of the mall) had a &quot;ghost town&quot; feel to it which took several years to turn around.  Today, Capitol Street, Hale Street, and other bordering streets are an eclectic mixture of restaurants, shops, businesses and services that many call the centerpiece of downtown.

The new Robert C. Byrd Federal Building, Haddad Riverfront Park and Capitol Market are just a few new developments that have helped growth in the downtown area during the 1990s. Charleston also became known as one of the premiere healthcare spots in the state. Along with ambitious thinking, plans for even new entertainment and business venues kept Charleston moving along at a steady pace.

In 1983, WV Public Radio launched a live-performance radio program statewide called Mountain Stage.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.mountainstage.org Mountain Stage - Where Musicians Come to Play&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; What began as a live, monthly state-wide broadcast went on to national distribution in 1986. Now in its 26th season, [[Mountain Stage]] with Larry Groce records 26 two-hour programs each year, mostly at the Culture Center Theater in Charleston, and is heard on over 100 radio stations through [[National Public Radio]] and around the world on the [[Voice of America]] satellite service.

2003 marked the opening of the [[Clay Center, West Virginia|Clay Center for the Arts &amp; Sciences]]. The center includes The Maier Foundation Performance Hall, The Walker Theatre, The Avampato Discovery Museum and an art museum. Also on site is The ElectricSky Theater, which is a 175-seat combination [[planetarium]] and dome-screen cinema. Movies shown at the theatre include educational large format ([[70 mm film|70&amp;nbsp;mm]]) presentations, and are often seen in similar [[IMAX Dome|Omnimax]] theatres. Planetarium shows are staged as a combination of pre-recorded and live presentations.

Many festivals and events were also incorporated into the calendar, including Multifest, Vandalia Festival, a 4 July celebration with fireworks at Haddad Riverfront Park, and the already popular Sternwheel Regatta, which was founded in 1970, provided a festive atmosphere for residents to enjoy. In 2005 [http://www.festivallcharleston.com FestivALL Charleston] was established and has grown into a ten day festival offering a variety of performances, events and exhibits in music, dance, theatre, visual arts and other entertainments.

Charleston West Virginia has one central agency for its economic development efforts, the [[Charleston Area Alliance]]. The Alliance works with local public officials and the private sector to build the economy of the region and revitalize its downtown. Charleston contains a historic district referred to as the East End.  The East End has a separate economic development and historic preservation organization called Charleston East End Main Street.

===Climate===
Charleston has a four-season climate lying within the northern fringes of a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfa'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wchstv.com/newsroom/wx/climatesummary.shtml |title=Charleston-Huntington Climate Summary - Eyewitness News Storm Team Weather |publisher=Wchstv.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Especially in winter, Charleston's average temperatures are warmer than the rest of the state, due to the city being west of the higher elevations. '''Spring''' is the most unpredictable season, and spring-like weather usually arrives in late March or early April. From the beginning of March through early May, temperatures can vary considerably and it is not unusual at this time for day-to-day temperature fluctuations to exceed {{convert|20|°F-change|0}}. Temperatures warm up considerably in late May, with warm summer-like days. '''Summer''' is hot, with 23 days of highs at or above {{convert|90|°F|1}}, sometimes reaching {{convert|95|°F}}, often accompanied by high humidity. '''Autumn''' features crisp evenings that warm quickly to mild to warm afternoons. '''Winters''' are cool, with a January daily average of {{convert|34.4|°F|1}}, but with occasional stretches of {{convert|50|°F}}+ temperatures, and sub-{{convert|0|°F|1}} lows are rare. Snowfall generally occurs from late November to early April, with the heaviest period being January and February. However, major snowstorms of more than {{convert|10|in|cm|0}} are rare. The area receives, excepting October, more than {{convert|3|in|0}} of precipitation each month, with measurable amounts falling on more than 150 days per year. Thunderstorms are frequent during the late spring and throughout the summer, and occasionally they can be quite severe, producing the rare [[tornado]].

Extremes have ranged from {{convert|−17|°F|0}} in December 1917 to {{convert|108|°F|0}} in July 1931 and August 1918.&lt;ref name = WeatherChannel &gt;

==Government==
Charleston functions under the [[Mayor-Council]] form of city government.  The [[Mayor]] is the designated Chief Executive Officer of the city with the duty to see that all of the laws and ordinances of the city are enforced.  The Mayor gives general supervision over all executive departments, offices and agencies of the city government and is the presiding officer of the Council and a voting member thereof.  The current mayor is a Republican, Danny Jones, who was elected in 2003, and re-elected in 2007 and 2011.  Charleston also has a City Manager who is appointed by the Mayor and approved by the Council.  The City Manager has supervision and control of the executive work and management of the heads of all departments under his control as directed by the Mayor, makes all contracts for labor and supplies, and generally has the responsibility for all of the business and administrative work of the city.

With 27 members, the Charleston City Council is somewhat larger than usual for a city with a population of 50,000.  Twenty-one of the Council members are elected from a specific [[Wards of the United States|Ward]] within the city, and an additional six members are elected by the city at large.

General Elections for Mayor, City Council and other city officers take place in May every four years (Primary Elections are held in March).  The most recent election was in May, 2011. The next scheduled election will be in 2015.

==Culture==

===Annual events and fairs===
Charleston is home to numerous annual events and fairs that take place throughout the city, from the banks of the [[Kanawha River]] to the capitol grounds.

The '''West Virginia Dance Festival''', held between April&amp;nbsp;25 and 30, features [[dance]] students from across the state that attend classes and workshops in [[ballet]], [[jazz]] and modern dance. At the finale, the students perform in the West Virginia State Theatre; these are free to the public.

Beginning in 1982, '''Symphony Sunday''', held annually usually the first weekend in June, is a full day of music, food, and family fun, culminating in a free performance by the [[West Virginia Symphony Orchestra]] and a fireworks display following. Throughout the day, local performing community dance and music ensembles present a series of their own selected pieces with the final performance being by the West Virginia Symphony Orchestra. The local performing community dance and music ensembles that perform for Symphony Sunday include the Kanawha Valley Ringers, the West Virginia Kickers, the Charleston Metro Band, the West Virginia Youth Symphony, the Mountain State Brass Band, and the Kanawha Valley Community Band. The now defunct Charleston Neophonic Orchestra has also performed at the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wvsl.org/symphsunday.htm|title=Symphony Sunday|publisher=West Virginia Symphony League}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event is held on the front lawn of the University of Charleston. The WVSO annually closes the event with the [[1812 Overture]] followed by &quot;[[The Stars and Stripes Forever]]&quot; before the fireworks display.

The Internationally syndicated [[NPR]] program '''[[Mountain Stage]]''' was founded in Charleston in 1983. The live performance music program, produced by [[West Virginia Public Broadcasting]], and heard on the [[Voice of America]] and via [[NPR Music]], records episodes regularly at the Culture Center Theater on the [[West Virginia State Capitol]] grounds. The show celebrated its 30th anniversary in 2013.

Twice a year, in late April and again in early November, the [http://www.wviff.org '''West Virginia International Film Festival'''] occurs, where many domestic and international films are shown that range from &quot;full-length feature films, shorts, documentaries, animation and student films. It is the official state film festival.

At the end of September of each year, usually the last Tuesday of September, Charleston hosts the [[Daily Mail Kanawha County Majorette and Band Festival]] for the eight public high schools in Kanawha County. The festival began in 1947 and has continued on as an annual tradition. The festival is held at the [[University of Charleston Stadium at Laidley Field]] in downtown Charleston. It is West Virginia's longest running music festival.

On the Saturday of Valentine's Day Weekend every year, residents gather together for the not-quite-a-5k [http://waterpenny.net/second-annual-grumble-run/ '''Grumble Run 5k'''].  The Run attracts those who aren't runners and the 5k features frequent stops for candy, conversation, ice cream, smoke breaks and general Grumbling about having to walk or jog for more than three miles.  This is paired with an Anti / Pro Valentine's Day Party which is hosted annually in the evenings.

On May 6, the '''Kanawha Kordsmen Barbershop Chorus''' performs at the [[Clay Center, West Virginia|Clay Center for the Arts &amp; Sciences]]. The 40-man [[a cappella]] chorus performs music in a show titled &quot;Songs America Sings.&quot; On [[Memorial Day]] weekend, the '''[http://www.wvculture.org/vandalia/ Vandalia Gathering]''' is held on the grounds of the state capitol. Thousands of visitors each year enjoy traditional music, art, dance, stories, crafts and food that stems from the &quot;uniqueness of West Virginia's mountain culture.&quot; There is no fee for admission.

Since 2005 '''[http://festivallcharleston.com/ FestivALL]''' has provided the Charleston area with cultural and artistic events beginning on June 20 ([[West Virginia Day]]) and including dance, theater, and music. FestivALL provides local artists a valuable chance to display their works and help get others interested in, and involved with, the local artistic community. Highlights include an art fair on Capitol Street and local bands playing live music at stages set up throughout downtown, as well as a wine and jazz festival on the campus of the [[University of Charleston]] featuring local and nationally known jazz artists and showcasing the products of West Virginia vineyards.

The '''Charleston Sternwheel Regatta''', founded in 1970, is a former annual event that was held on Labor Day weekend of each year. The event had carnival style rides and attractions and live music from local and nationally known bands. It was held on the Kanawha Boulevard by Haddad Riverfront Park on the Kanawha River. The event started the Wednesday before Labor Day Weekend and ended the Sunday of Labor Day Weekend with a fireworks show on Sunday evening. Due to &quot;political differences&quot; between local sternwheel owners and factions of city government, sternwheel attendance declined in recent years. Once a promising regatta, rivaling Tall Stacks in Cincinnati, it was discontinued after the 2008 festival season. Charleston, home to the largest population of privately owned sternwheel vessels in the United States is the only city in the region not home to an annual river festival.

The 2008 World's Strongest Man Competition was hosted in Charleston, the hometown of [[Phil Pfister]], the champion of the 2006 games.

The Beach Sports Network, comprising The EVP Tour and Upstate Watercraft Promotions, produced the first annual &quot;EVP Rocks the River&quot; from July 31-August 2, 2009.  This consisted of a Volleyball tournament alongside world class Watercross.

[[File:Marion County Courthouse Fairmont.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Marion County Courthouse (West Virginia)|Marion County Courthouse]] in Fairmont.]]

'''Fairmont''' is a city in [[Marion County, West Virginia|Marion County]], [[West Virginia]], [[United States]]. The population was 18,704 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. It is the [[county seat]] of [[Marion County, West Virginia|Marion County]].{{GR|6}}

==History==
* Oral history indicates that in 1808, Boaz Fleming made his annual trek to Clarksburg to pay his brother's Harrison County taxes. While in Clarksburg, he attended a social gathering that included Dolly Madison, his cousin. He complained to her about having to travel over a hundred miles each year from his home to pay his Monongalia County taxes and his brother's Harrison County taxes. Dolly Madison supposedly suggested that he create his own county to save him all that travel. Six years later, Boaz Fleming circulated a petition to do precisely that, naming the proposed county Madison County, in her and her husband's, President James Madison, honor. The petition failed to gain sufficient support to be presented to the Virginia General Assembly. He then focused on creating a town near his farm. In 1819, a road was built from Clarksburg to Morgantown. His farm was about halfway between the two, making a good resting point. He laid out the town on the west side of the Monongahela River in 1819. It was incorporated on January 19, 1820 as Middletown. It is unknown if the town was called Middletown because of its location mid-way between Clarksburg and Morgantown or because Boaz Fleming's first wife, Elizabeth Hutchinson, was originally from Middletown, Delaware. Middletown was named newly formed Marion County's first county seat on February 18, 1842. At that time, William Haymond, Jr. suggested that the town's name be changed to Fairmont because the town had a beautiful overlook of the Monongahela River, giving it a &quot;fair mount.&quot; The Borough of Fairmont was incorporated in 1843 by the Virginia General Assembly.&quot;

* Established in 1820 as '''Middletown''', then in [[Monongalia County, West Virginia|Monongalia County]], it was chartered by the [[Virginia General Assembly]] in 1843 as '''Fairmont''', a contraction of &quot;Fair Mountain&quot;.

* [[Country Club Bakery]] in Fairmont is &quot;The Home of the Original [[Pepperoni Roll]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bobheffner.com/pepperoniroll/history.htm Pepperoni Roll History]&lt;/ref&gt;

* The former head of the art department at [[Fairmont State University]], [[Luella Mundel]], was the subject of a documentary called ''American Inquisition'' by [[Helen Whitney]].  Mundel was the victim of [[blacklist]]ing during the [[McCarthyism|McCarthy]] era, and the documentary showed how the negative effects of that era reached even smalltown West Virginia.  This documentary was the subject of a very [[Floyd Abrams and the McCarthy documentary case|famous case]] about the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;Floyd Abrams, ''Speaking Freely'', published by [[Viking Press]] (2005), Page 153-58&lt;/ref&gt;

*The site of the first [[Father's Day]] on July 5, 1908, originally celebrated in honor of the more than 200 fathers lost in the [[Monongah Mining disaster]] several months earlier.  However, neither Fairmont nor the state of [[West Virginia]] chartered the holiday to make it official, so several other locales have erroneously taken credit for its inception over the years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firstfathersday.us/index_02.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

*William S. Barnes born 1735, recognized patriot, militia man in the Revolutionary War, and progenitor of the Barnes family currently living in Fairmont and surrounding areas was the first person to live in what is currently Marion County and Fairmont, WV. He constructed a corn mill to process grain a short distance above where the Fairmont City Reservoir currently resides, and his pioneer house stood where the Fairmont Chemical Company is constructed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~jhwilcox/people/JohnWilcox/famf00032.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elkins''' is a city in [[Randolph County, West Virginia|Randolph County]], [[West Virginia]], [[United States]].  The community was incorporated in 1890 and named in honor of [[Stephen Benton Elkins]] (1841–1911), a [[U.S. Senator]] from West Virginia. The population was 7,094 at the [[United States Census, 2010|2010 census]]. It is the [[county seat]] of [[Randolph County, West Virginia|Randolph County]].{{GR|6}}  Elkins is home to [[Davis and Elkins College]] and to the Mountain State Forest Festival, held in early October every year.

==History==
The City of Elkins, situated on a bend in the [[Tygart Valley River]], was developed by Senators [[Henry Gassaway Davis]] and [[Stephen Benton Elkins]] and named for Senator Elkins, in 1890. Elkins became the county seat in 1899. The founders developed railroad lines, [[coal mine]]s, and [[logging|timbering]] businesses. Together, they built the [[West Virginia Central and Pittsburgh Railway]] into Elkins in 1889, opening a vast territory to industrial development in the late 1890s. In 1904 the Randolph County courthouse was completed in Elkins. It was built in the Richardsonian Romanesque style.

As the railroad (merged into the [[Western Maryland Railway]] in 1905) expanded, Elkins experienced the luxury of [[passenger train]] service. In 1930, 18 passenger trains were arriving and leaving Elkins daily. All passenger service was discontinued in 1958.

Davis and Elkins each built permanent places of residence known as [[Halliehurst]] and [[Graceland (Elkins, West Virginia)|Graceland]], where the view of the town was delightful and picturesque.

Today, Elkins has an active economic development authority, [[chamber of commerce]], downtown business organization and numerous social, fraternal and service organizations that sponsor annual events like the Mountain State Forest Festival, which brings thousands of people into the city every year.

'''Wheeling''' is a city in the [[U.S. state|State]] of [[West Virginia]] located in [[Ohio County, West Virginia|Ohio]] and [[Marshall County, West Virginia|Marshall]] counties. It is the [[county seat]] of Ohio County.{{GR|6}} Wheeling is the principal city of the [[Wheeling metropolitan area|Wheeling Metropolitan Statistical Area]]. As of the 2000 census, the Wheeling, WV MSA had a population of 153,172.
							
Wheeling was originally a settlement in the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Colony and Dominion of Virginia|Colony of Virginia]] and later an important city in the [[Commonwealth of Virginia]]. It was part of the land which the United States allowed to be annexed to Virginia when the Northwest Territory was being organized in 1787. In 1853 the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] (B&amp;O) reached Wheeling, connecting it to markets back to the port city of [[Baltimore, Maryland]] and stimulating development.

In 1861, with differences over [[slavery]] and loyalty to the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] upon the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]], the western counties of Virginia seceded from the state. Wheeling was the location of the [[Wheeling Convention]], which established the state of West Virginia, and was the first capital of West Virginia. The capital moved so often in its early years that it was nicknamed the &quot;floating capital&quot;. 

In 1870, the State Legislature designated [[Charleston, West Virginia|Charleston]] as the capital city. In 1875, the Legislature reversed its decision and voted to return the capital to Wheeling. This was appealed by the citizens of Charleston and finally settled by the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals in favor of Wheeling. In 1877 the Legislature ordered an election to be held for the citizens of West Virginia to select a permanent location for the capital, choosing between Charleston, Martinsburg and Clarksburg. By proclamation of the governor, the official move took place eight years later, and in 1885 the capital moved from Wheeling to Charleston, where it has remained.

==History==
===European discovery===
The origins of the name &quot;Wheeling&quot; are disputed. One of the more credible explanations is that the word comes from the [[Lenni-Lenape]] phrase ''wih link'', which meant &quot;place of the head.&quot; This supposedly referred to a white settler who was scalped and decapitated. His severed head was displayed at the confluence of [[Wheeling Creek (West Virginia)|Wheeling Creek]] and the [[Ohio River]].&lt;ref&gt;Jack M. Weatherford (1991), ''Native Roots: How the Indians Enriched America'', p. 263, ISBN 0-449-90713-9&lt;/ref&gt; the area had been inhabited by Native Americans for thousands of years. In the 17th century, the Iroquois from present-day New York state conquered the upper Ohio Valley, pushing out other tribes and maintaining the area as their hunting ground. 

Originally explored by the French, Wheeling still has a lead plate remnant buried by the explorer [[Pierre Joseph Céloron de Blainville|Céloron de Blainville]] in 1749 at the mouth of Wheeling Creek to mark their claim. Later, [[Christopher Gist]] and [[George Washington]] surveyed the land, in 1751 and 1770, respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;The West Virginia Encyclopedia&quot;&gt;{{cite book |editor=Sullivan, Ken| title=The West Virginia Encyclopedia |origyear=2006 |year= 2006|publisher= West Virginia Humanities Council |isbn= 0-9778498-0-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Establishment===
During the fall of 1769, [[Ebenezer Zane]] explored the Wheeling area and established claim to the land via &quot;[[tomahawk rights]].&quot; (This process meant to deaden a few trees near the head of a spring, and mark the bark with the initials of the name of the person who made the claim). He returned the following spring with his wife Elizabeth and his younger brothers, Jonathan and Silas; they established the first permanent European settlement in the Wheeling area, naming it Zanesburg. Other families joined the settlement, including the Shepherds (see [[Shepherd Hall (Monument Place)|Monument Place]]), the Wetzels, and the McCollochs (see [[McColloch's Leap]]). 

In 1787, the United States gave Virginia this portion of lands west of the Appalachians, and some to Pennsylvania at its western edge, to settle their claims. By the Northwest Ordinance that year, it established the [[Northwest Territory]] to cover other lands north of the Ohio River and west to the [[Mississippi River]]. Settlers began to move into new areas along the Ohio.

In 1793, Ebenezer Zane divided the town into lots, and Wheeling was officially established as a town in 1795 by legislative enactment. The town was incorporated January 16, 1805. On March 11, 1836, the town of Wheeling was incorporated into the city of Wheeling.

By an act of the [[Virginia General Assembly]] on December 27, 1797, Wheeling was named the county seat of [[Ohio County, West Virginia|Ohio County]].&lt;ref name=&quot;History of Wheeling City and Ohio County, West Virginia and Representative Citizens&quot;&gt;{{cite book |editor=Cranmer, Hon. Gibson Lamb.| title=History of Wheeling City and Ohio County, West Virginia and Representative Citizens|origyear=1902 |year= 1902|publisher= Biographical Publishing Company|location= Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fort Henry===
Originally dubbed ''Fort Fincastle'' in 1774, the fort was later renamed [[Fort Henry (West Virginia)|Fort Henry]] in honor of Virginia's American governor, [[Patrick Henry]]. In 1777, Native Americans of the [[Shawnee]], [[Wyandot people|Wyandot]] and [[Mingo]] tribes joined to attack pioneer settlements along the upper [[Ohio River]], which were illegal according to the Crown's [[Proclamation of 1763]]. They hoped an alliance with the British would drive the colonial settlers out of their territory. 

Local men, later joined by recruits from Fort Shepherd (in Elm Grove) and Fort Holliday, defended the fort. The native force burned the surrounding cabins and destroyed livestock.

[[File:McColloch's Leap.jpg|thumb|&quot;McColloch's Leap&quot;]]

During the first attack of the year, Major Samuel McColloch led a small force of men from Fort Vanmetre along [[Short Creek, West Virginia|Short Creek]] to assist the besieged Fort Henry. Separated from his men, McColloch was chased by attacking Indians. Upon his horse, McColloch charged up Wheeling Hill and made what is known as [[McColloch's Leap]] {{convert|300|ft|m}} down its eastern side.

In 1782, a native army along with British soldiers attempted to take Fort Henry. During this siege, Fort Henry's supply of ammunition was exhausted. The defenders decided to dispatch a man to secure more ammunition from the Zane homestead. [[Betty Zane]] volunteered for the dangerous task. During her departing run, she was heckled by both native and British soldiers. After reaching the Zane homestead, she gathered a tablecloth and filled it with gunpowder. During her return, she was fired upon but was uninjured. As a result of her heroism, Fort Henry remained in American control.&lt;ref name=&quot;History of Wheeling City and Ohio County, West Virginia and Representative Citizens&quot; /&gt;

===Industrialization and anti-secession sentiment===
In 1853 the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] reached Wheeling, connecting it to Pennsylvania, Maryland and the North in terms of trade. A bridge over the river connected it to [[Bellaire, Ohio]] and western areas. Much of this area had been settled by yeomen farmers, few of whom owned slaves. With the railroad, a larger industrial or mercantile middle-class developed that depended on free labor; it either felt disinterest or hostility to slavery. The ''Wheeling Intelligencer'' newspaper expressed the area's anti-secession sentiment as tensions rose over slavery and national issues. The city became part of the movement of western areas to secede from Virginia after the beginning of the Civil War. It was the location of the aforementioned [[Wheeling Convention]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=-0knsLn7krcC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP15&amp;dq=%22wheeling+west+virginia%22&amp;ots=k76nSBeOM_&amp;sig=61zI1N5HRLAAJ66GKxoCB9laGZk#v=onepage&amp;q=wheeling&amp;f=false Ronald L. Lewis, ''Transforming the Appalachian Countryside: Railroads, Deforestation, and ...''], p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;  It served as the provisional capital of the [[Restored Government of Virginia]] from 1861 to 1863, and became the first capital of West Virginia after it seceded from Virginia and was admitted to the Union in its own right in 1863.

The growing German population, which included immigrants after the [[1848 Revolutions]], was firmly anti-slavery. The Germans of Wheeling organized the &quot;First West Virginia Artillery&quot; to oppose the Confederacy and played a role in the initial movement to separate from Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=PVzNAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA120&amp;dq=%22wheeling%22+virginia+history+university&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=8DdoTv-nEYiCsgLL0oyuDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwADgU#v=onepage&amp;q=wheeling&amp;f=false Herrmann Schuricht, ''History of the German Element in Virginia,'' Volume 2], pp. 112-122&lt;/ref&gt; The Germans' culture influenced the city, such as their &quot;German Singing Societies,&quot; the first of which began in 1855.&lt;ref&gt;Edward C. Wolf, &quot;Wheeling's German Singing Societies&quot;, ''West Virginia History'', 1980-1981 42(1-2): 1-56&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-Civil War growth===
Although Wheeling lost its position as capital in 1865, it continued to grow. In the late nineteenth century, it served as a prime industrial center for the state. Noted businesses of the era included the [[Bloch Brothers Tobacco Company]] and steel concerns.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=Ts4gcxT0YeAC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=wheeling+west+virginia+history&amp;ots=7FIwkUO0K_&amp;sig=zSc_hh_VpJOXpBjOvH0CMsdtFsA#v=onepage&amp;q=wheeling%20&amp;f=false Otis K. Rice, Stephen W. Brown, ''West Virginia: A History,'' pp. 199-201]&lt;/ref&gt; As it grew, prosperous residents built an area of fine housing around [[Wheeling Island]], but slums also grew.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=lp5Li57vz3oC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=wheeling+west+virginia+history&amp;ots=_zqYpRdE0v&amp;sig=RxvZa02P2ur7jOzAqzbUtWLh4wE#v=onepage&amp;q=wheeling%20suburb&amp;f=false John Alexander Williams, ''West Virginia, A History''], American Association for State and Local History, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt;

With industry, Wheeling reached its peak of population in 1930. The [[Great Depression]], and later changes and restructuring in heavy industry following World War II, led to a loss of working-class jobs and population. Capitalizing on its rich architectural heritage, Wheeling has worked to revive its main street and heritage tourism activities near the Ohio River. In addition, West Virginia has constructed fiber optics networks for advanced communication. Wheeling is becoming a center in health services and education as well.

==Geography==

The city of Wheeling has a rich and varied history. [[West Virginia Independence Hall]] was the site of the [[Wheeling Convention]], two meetings held in 1861 that ultimately reversed Virginia's [[Ordinance of Secession]].  Twenty-six counties in Virginia's north and west voted against secession from the Union and created the new state of West Virginia, which the United States quickly admitted. Later in 1861 and continuing to 1863, the building was the site of many heated debates during the [[First Constitutional Convention of West Virginia]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wvculture.org/history/statehood/cctoc.html First Constitutional Convention of West Virginia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; including the name of the new state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wvculture.org/history/statehood/statename.html The Naming of West Virginia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The monument was erected in front of the flagpole near the main shelter of Bethlehem Community Park in the village of Bethlehem, just southeast of Wheeling.
The roughly 6 foot tall granite memorial consists of a large, bronze dedication plaque with the names of KIAs from the Wheeling/Ohio County region. Below the dedication plaque is a bronze map of South Vietnam, complete with names of 28 major cities.

The park consists of 60% bowls and 40% street elements; it is located within the Chambers Ballfield Complex in the Elm Grove section of the City.  An addition to the street section of the park was completed by Grindline in November 2009. A covered shelter, restrooms, and webcam are scheduled to be installed in early 2010.

Moreover, in August 2007, the Capitol was closed due to several fire and building code violations. On February 5, 2009, the Wheeling Convention and Visitors Bureau (CVB) announced that it would purchase the then-Capitol Music Hall from Live Nation at a cost of $615,000. The purchase was finalized on April 3, 2009. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.theintelligencer.net/page/content.detail/id/520347.html?nav=515&lt;/ref&gt;

==Local events and culture==
Since 1976, the Ohio River Sternwheel Festival [http://www.ohioriversternwheelfestival.org/] has been a major event on both sides of the Ohio River, in the towns of Williamstown and Marietta, Ohio. The celebration was created around the races of the sternwheelers (also known as the [[paddle steamer]]) that the Mid-Ohio Valley is known for, and today there are pageants, live music, food and a grand fireworks display. The event brings many local community members back to the area around the Labor Day weekend in the month of September.

The start of the Williamstown Fireman's Ice Cream Social was in 1944. This is also a form of homecoming for many local citizens. Many come home to gather for the hot dogs, donated cakes and other desserts from community members, ice cream and popcorn. It is also a time where many Williamstown High School alumni will hold and center their reunion events around the Friday night in July. The firemen put the event on to bring the community together and over a hundred gallons of ice cream each year [http://www.newsandsentinel.com/page/content.detail/id/550028/Ice-cream-social-fills-park.html?nav=5061]. The Fire Company of Williamstown hold the social in Tomlinson Park as a fundraiser for the volunteer organization. The money brought in is needed for updates on equipment and training. They annually raise between $7,000-$8,000. However, most of the general sum of money comes purely from donations given and not the sale of food.

==Climate==
The climate in this area is characterized by relatively high temperatures and evenly distributed precipitation throughout the year.  According to the [[Köppen Climate Classification]] system, Williamstown has a [[Humid subtropical climate]], abbreviated &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=948664&amp;cityname=Williamstown%2C+West+Virginia%2C+United+States+of+America&amp;units= Climate Summary for Williamstown, West Virginia]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fenton Glass==
{{Main|Fenton Art Glass Company}}

Founded in 1905 by brothers Frank L. and John W. Fenton, the [[Fenton Art Glass Company]] is the largest manufacturer of hand made glass in the United States. The firm is now led by third- and fourth-generation Fenton family members.

After officials of Fenton Art Glass announced the fifth generation family company would shut down the 100-year-old factory at the end of 2007, thousands of loyal Fenton customers reacted with an outpouring of orders, selling out the QVC show that was to be its last in just minutes instead of the scheduled 2-hour show. Fenton is now open and working to stay open; tours are run daily through the gift shop and orders are placed online, on QVC and via its decades-old catalog. Fenton Art Glass Company has officially stopped making glass.

As of May 24, 2012 completion the sale of selected assets as scheduled. This included the sale of the name and logo, the formulas for the glass, molds and other materials that were used by the company. However, today the company now makes handcrafted glass jewelry; including beads and Teardrop earrings. The jewelry is made in many of the classic Fenton colors and styles popular with collectors.

'''Parkersburg''', located at the [[confluence]] of the [[Ohio River|Ohio]] and [[Little Kanawha River|Little Kanawha]] Rivers, is the third largest city in the [[West Virginia|State of West Virginia]].  It is the [[county seat]] of [[Wood County, West Virginia|Wood County]]{{GR|6}} and the largest city in the Parkersburg–[[Marietta, Ohio|Marietta]]–[[Vienna, West Virginia|Vienna]] [[Parkersburg–Marietta–Vienna metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]]. The population was 31,492 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. It is about 14 miles south of [[Marietta, Ohio]].

Parkersburg was connected to the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] in 1857, but lacked a crossing over the Ohio River until after the [[American Civil War]]. When constructed 1868-1870, the [[Parkersburg Bridge (CSX)]] by the B&amp;O to [[Belpre, Ohio|Belpre]] was the longest railroad bridge in the world.

The [[Bureau of the Public Debt]], an agency of the [[U.S. Treasury Department]], was relocated from the [[Washington, DC]] metropolitan area and is headquartered in Parkersburg.

==History==
Parkersburg was originally named '''Newport''' when it was laid out in the late 18th century following the [[American Revolutionary War]]. A town section was laid out over land granted to Alexander Parker for his Revolutionary War service, as Virginia, which then controlled the territory, was using land grants in lieu of cash payments to veterans. The title conflicts between Parker and the city planners of Newport were settled in 1809 in favor of his heirs. The town was renamed '''Parkersburg''' in 1810. It was chartered by the [[Virginia General Assembly]] in 1820. It was rechartered as a city in 1860.

The town was the terminus of the [[Staunton-Parkersburg Turnpike]] and the [[Northwestern Turnpike]]. In 1857 the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] built a branch line south to the town from Wheeling. Travelers wanting to connect with the Ohio [[Marietta and Cincinnati Railroad]], one of the east-west lines along the Ohio River, had to take a steamboat 14 miles north to [[Marietta, Ohio]].

A planned railroad bridge was designed by Jacob Linville and finally constructed by the B&amp;O in 1868–1870 between Parkersburg and [[Belpre, Ohio]], as part of its main line from Baltimore to [[St. Louis, Missouri]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hh:@field(DOCID+@lit(WV0105)) ''Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad, Parkersburg Bridge, Ohio River, Parkersburg, Wood County, WV''], Historic American Engineering Record, accessed 22 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt; This pulled away traffic and trade from Marietta. Today the structure is known as the [[Parkersburg Bridge (CSX)]].

The town was important as a transportation and medical center during the [[American Civil War]]. It became a transportation hub in the gas and oil boom following that war.

[[Blennerhassett Island]] is a historical site located in Parkersburg.

The city is situated at the confluence of the [[Little Kanawha River|Little Kanawha]] and [[Ohio River|Ohio]] rivers. The Little Kanawha River divides the north and south sides of the city. [[Worthington Creek]], a tributary of the Little Kanawha River, flows through the eastern part of the city.&lt;ref name=DeLorme&gt;{{cite book| title= West Virginia Atlas &amp; Gazetteer |year=1997 |publisher= [[DeLorme]] |location=Yarmouth, Me. |isbn= 0-89933-246-3 |page= 22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ravens are a part of the Mountain State Football League.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wtap.com/sports/headlines/Semi-Pro_Football_122785769.html?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=facebook&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/WoodCountyRavens&lt;/ref&gt;

Parkersburg was home to the [[Ohio Valley Redcoats]], a minor league baseball team, until 1998.  The city is in negotiations to bring professional baseball back to Parkersburg.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newsandsentinel.com/page/content.detail/id/507520.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the city and its three high schools placed second in [[ESPN]]'s [[List of SportsCenter segments and specials#Special|TitleTown USA]] competition.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newsandsentinel.com/page/content.detail/id/507650.html?nav=5061&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;We don't have a lot of people, nor any professional sports teams, but here is a stat for you. AAA is the highest level that a high school can compete at in W.Va. Both schools mentioned hereafter are AAA schools. In Parkersburg, we have accumulated 192 overall state championships in 103 years with 183 if those coming since 1950. Parkersburg High School alone has 137 championships in its 103 years of existence. There is also another AAA school in Parkersburg called Parkersburg South High School, who, by the way, has 38 titles in 40 years. Not to be outdone Parkersburg Catholic, a single A school, has 17 state titles of its own. Not bad considering that there are 136 high school teams in West Virginia with 38 in AAA. We may not have a pro sports team, but in high school sports, Parkersburg as a whole is pretty dominant&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/titletown/news/story?id=3453896&lt;/ref&gt; as written in an article on espn.com.

==Film and television==
* The [[Steven Soderbergh]] film ''[[Bubble (film)|Bubble]]'', released in 2006, was filmed in Parkersburg and neighboring [[Belpre, Ohio]], using an all-local cast.
* Parkersburg was mentioned in the novel ''[[The Night of the Hunter (novel)|Night of the Hunter]]'' (1953) and the 1955 film by the same name adapted from it. In [[Davis Grubb]]'s 1953 novel, Parkersburg was the town where the preacher [[Harry Powell]] was caught for car theft and sent to prison. It was worldly town that Rachel Cooper ([[Lillian Gish]] in the film) avoided because she'd been short-changed; and finally it was the home of the state troopers who came to arrest Powell for murder. Powell called Parkersburg, &quot;One of them [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodoms]] on the Ohio River,&quot; referring to its reputation as a rough river town in the 19th and early 20th century. 
* Parkersburg was the set for the 1962 television series ''[[It's a Man's World (TV series)|It's a Man's World]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;imdb.com&quot;/&gt;
* The city was featured in a 1989 episode of ''[[Rescue 911]]''.
* Other films shot in the city are ''[[Salvage (film)|Salvage]]'' and ''[[The Barbecue]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;imdb.com&quot;&gt;http://www.imdb.com/List?endings=on&amp;&amp;locations=Parkersburg,%20West%20Virginia,%20USA&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Morgantown''' is a city in [[Monongalia County, West Virginia|Monongalia County]], [[West Virginia]]. It is the county seat. Situated along the banks of the [[Monongahela River]], Morgantown is the largest city in [[North-Central West Virginia]], and the base of the [[Morgantown metropolitan area]]. It has a permanent population of  29,660 per the 2010 census, with  [[West Virginia University]] adding several thousand seasonal residents to the city and surrounding area from September through May. Morgantown is best known as the home of both West Virginia University and the one-of-a-kind [[Morgantown Personal Rapid Transit]] system.

==History==
[[Image:Wharf-District.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Historic warehouse in Wharf District, converted to restaurant during late-1990s/early-2000s riverfront refurbishing.&lt;!--image taken Aug. 2006)--&gt;]]
Morgantown is closely tied to the Anglo-French struggle for this territory. Until the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1763, what is now known as Morgantown was greatly contested among settlers and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], as well as the British and the French. The treaty decided the issue in favor of the British, but Indian fighting continued almost to the beginning of the [[American Revolution]].

[[Zackquill Morgan]], son of [[Morgan Morgan]], and his brother David entered the area of [[Virginia]] that would become Morgantown in about 1767, although others such as Thomas Decker are recorded as attempting settlements in the area earlier or at about the same time. As well, several forts were built in the area during this time: Fort Pierpont near the [[Cheat River]], in 1769; Fort Coburn, near [[Dorsey's Knob, West Virginia|Dorsey's Knob]], in 1770. Fort Morgan, at the present site of Morgantown, in 1772; Fort Dinwiddle, north several miles at [[Stewartstown, West Virginia|Stewartstown]], in 1772; Fort Martin, several miles north on the [[Monongahela River]], in 1773; Fort Burris in the present-day Suncrest area of Morgantown, in 1774; and Fort Kern in the present-day Greenmont area of Morgantown, in 1774, in addition to other, smaller forts.

Zackquill Morgan settled the area about 1772 by establishing a homestead near present-day Fayette Street and University Avenue. Morgan fought in both the [[French and Indian War]] and the [[American Revolutionary War]], rising to the rank of [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]].  By 1783, following his wartime duties, Colonel Morgan commissioned Major William Haymond to survey his land and divide it into streets and lots. Colonel Morgan then received a legal certificate for {{convert|400|acre|km2}} in the area of his settlement near the mouth of Decker's Creek. {{convert|50|acre|m2}} were appropriated for Morgan's Town by the [[Virginia General Assembly]] in October 1785. On February 3, 1838, the Virginia General Assembly enacted a [[municipal charter]] incorporating the city, now with a population of about 700, as Morgantown, Virginia.  The town became part of the newly created state of [[West Virginia]] on June 20, 1863, through the [[Reorganized Government of Virginia]].

The [[cable television]] network [[MTV]] announced in October 2006, that it would tape an eight-episode [[reality TV]] series, ''Show Choir'', following [[Morgantown High School]]'s [[show choir]], which performs songs in four-part [[harmony]], with costumes and [[choreography]], on a competitive circuit. The show was scheduled to premiere Spring 2007, but as of 2012 has yet to air.&lt;ref&gt;Reuters/''Hollywood Reporter'' via Yahoo!

The 2006 film ''[[We Are Marshall]]'' has two brief scenes set in, but not filmed in, Morgantown.

Morgantown is the title and location of the second volume of [[Keith Maillard]]'s much-admired quartet of novels, 'Difficulty at the Beginning'. The town is also mentioned in other novels by Maillard, where it is placed near the fictitious WV town of Raysburg.

===Personal Rapid Transit System===
During the 1970s, the [[U.S. Department of Transportation]] built an experimental personal rapid transit system in the city, citing the area's variable seasonal [[climate]]s and geographic elevations as factors in testing the technology's viability. The [[Morgantown Personal Rapid Transit]] (PRT) has been in use since 1975. University students use the system for free to travel between the spread-out campuses.

==Transportation==

===Airport===
[[Morgantown Municipal Airport]] is one of West Virginia's few commercial airports. It is located approximately {{convert|3|mi}} northeast of the downtown along [[U.S. Route 119 in West Virginia|U.S. Route 119]].

===Rail===
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2012}}
The only active rail line near Morgantown is owned by [[Norfolk Southern]] with [[CSX]] trackage rights and serves a mine located northwest of [[Rivesville, West Virginia]]. Coal is the major commodity, with a train serving local chemical industries such as Tanner and Chemtura that require tank cars. These are trucked in and then loaded onto high side gondolas or bulkhead flat cars. [[Conrail]] was split by Norfolk Southern and CSX in 1999. CSX pays for half of the cost of maintenance for the line. CSX uses it mostly to bring trains from Grafton to load at Consol's Bailey Mine and for direct access to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

===River===
Morgantown relies heavily on the [[Monongahela River]] for shipping coal and other products.  The river is fully navigable from its mouth at the [[Ohio River]] in [[Pittsburgh]], past Morgantown upstream to [[Fairmont, West Virginia|Fairmont]].  [[Morgantown Lock and Dam]], located in the southern part of the city, helps to provide a continuous pool heading upstream towards the [[Hildebrand Lock and Dam]], and the [[Opekiska Lock and Dam]].  [[Point Marion Lock and Dam]], the next downstream dam, is responsible for most of the river's pool in Morgantown.

{{See also|Morgantown Personal Rapid Transit}}
Most of Morgantown is accessible by [[Mountain Line Transit Authority]] bus system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.busride.org/ |title=Busride.org |publisher=Busride.org |date= |accessdate=2013-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most service operates Monday-Saturday from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. with a very limited service operating on Sunday during the WVU school year. MountainLine's Grey Line bus operates every day of the year between [[Clarksburg, West Virginia]] and [[Pittsburgh International Airport]]. Morgantown also has the [[Morgantown Personal Rapid Transit]] (PRT) system. The system has five stations (Walnut, Beechurst, Engineering, Towers, and Medical) covering {{convert|8.65|mi|1}}.

[[Image:City of Morgantown from the west side of the Monongahela River, May 2012.jpg|thumb|right|250px|City of Morgantown, WV from the west side of the Monongahela River.]]
Morgantown is made up of several neighborhoods, some of which were previously independent towns that were annexed by the city as it continued to grow. Neighborhoods include First Ward, Woodburn, South Park, Jerome Park, South Hills, Second Ward, Greenmont, Suncrest, Evansdale, Wiles Hill, Sunnyside, Sabraton, the Mileground, and North Hills.  While some of these, such as the Mileground, Easton, and Sabraton, are in part or entirely outside the city limits, they are still considered part of Morgantown. The Morgantown MSA contains roughly 117,000{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} permanent residents, including over 30,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WVU enrollment rises as overall state enrollment decreases|url=http://wvutoday.wvu.edu/n/2011/11/10/wvu-enrollment-rises-as-overall-state-enrollment-decreases|publisher=WVU.edu|accessdate=24 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  full-time students at West Virginia University.

===Suncrest===
&lt;!--This paragraph is not Suncrest-specific, and should be moved to general history section: Morgantown was closely tied to the Anglo-French struggle for this territory. Until the Treaty of Paris in 1763, what is now known as Morgantown was greatly contested among settlers and native Indians, as well as the English and the French. The treaty decided the issue in favor of the English, but Indian fighting continued almost to the beginning of the Revolution.
--&gt;
Fort Burris was erected in 1774 in what became the Suncrest area of Morgantown. The fort was a settler's blockhouse located in what as of 2010 is the Summers Masonic Lodge at the intersection of Burroughs and Windsor streets.

During 1885-1888, the land in the Evansdale/Suncrest area was agricultural, with farms of {{convert|400|-|1000|acre|km2}}. Drummond's Chapel was named after a minister who then moved to Missouri. The Evans Farm was located on land near Riverview Drive and 8th Street and was named for Colonel John Evans, who fought in the [[American Revolution]] with Morgantown founder Zack Morgan. The Krepps farmhouse was located on land where the [[West Virginia University]] Creative Arts Center, Engineering and Agricultural buildings would later be built.  Dilley Farm was located on the other side of 8th street. The Van Voorhis Farm was large. Down Collins Ferry Road was the Anderson Farm. The Jacobs Farm was below Elmhurst and Mulberry.

Trolley cars determined how far people lived outside of the city, and did not reach to what is now Suncrest. By 1920, however, cars were becoming common.

In 1923, the Monongahela Development Company bought land from Krepps and most others else in the area. Suncrest Park bought Sears Roebuck house plans and divided Suncrest into three areas: Fairfield Street, Suncrest Park and Suncrest. No [[African-American]]s, [[Jew]]s or immigrants were permitted to buy land there. In 1928, the Suncrest Home Association developers gave {{convert|30|acre|m2}} for what became Krepps Park.  A civic group built facilities and the park was given to Morgantown, which made some improvements.

By 1937, Suncrest needed a town government to pave streets and provide water and sewer. Dr. Julian Leach, a WVU plant pathologist, was elected mayor; Bill Hart was a later mayor. Suncrest finally became part of Morgantown.  In 1940 the Dupont industrial park around the Kenmore Street area built 100 homes with six different floor plans.  From 1947 to 1950, Gunnison homes were built in the Mulberry and Lake Street areas. The development of the DuPont Ordnance Works during World War II in Westover resulted in a large number of prefabricated homes being constructed in Suncrest. Old Suncrest and Suncrest Addition were among the names given to various subsections of this growing community. The names of some streets reflected the community’s participation in various service organizations, such as Civitan, Kiwanis, Lions and Rotary. Before Suncrest became part of Morgantown in 1949, it had first been incorporated in 1937 as the town of Suncrest; the name came from a developer who looked out one morning and saw the sun crest over a hill.

The area from University Avenue to the university's medical school held a racetrack at one point. When there was talk of building a medical school in West Virginia, [[Charleston, West Virginia|Charleston]] and [[Huntington, West Virginia|Huntington]] vied for it, but Morgantown offered to give {{convert|60|acre|m2}} and provide a county hospital.  A cemetery with 200 graves near what is now [[West Virginia University Hospitals|Ruby Memorial Hospital]] had to be relocated to the West Run area. Around 1928, there was an airport near where the West Virginia University Coliseum was later built.

Suncrest students attend three or four schools throughout their K-12 education, starting at Suncrest Primary School or North Elementary School, Suncrest Middle School and Morgantown High School depending on where they live.

In 2000, the White House Millennium Council designated Suncrest as a Millennium Community.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

===Sunnyside===
Sunnyside, located just north of downtown Morgantown, is an older neighborhood adjacent to West Virginia University's downtown campus.  The neighborhood is bounded by University Avenue to the east and Campus Drive to the south. Close to the downtown campus of West Virginia University and for decades known as a neighborhood of student housing, is also the scene of many off-campus parties and post-game celebrations including, until 1995,&lt;ref name=quieteraffair /&gt; to the unsanctioned annual back-to-school [[block party]] that would annually draw upward of 10,000 revelers to celebrate the start of fall classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ahrens|first=Frank|title=WVU, No. 1 in Fun?

The City of Morgantown and West Virginia University jointly establish the Sunnyside Up Project: Campus Neighborhoods Revitalization Corporation, dedicated to the redevelopment of this area. The first step was to create a comprehensive revitalization plan, which was published in fall 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.morgantown.com/sunnyside/Sunnyside.pdf | title = Sunnyside Up Project: Campus Neighborhoods Revitalization Corporation | publisher = Morgantown.com}}{{dead link|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The University's Summit Hall Dormitory and the Honors Hall Dormitory are located in the southern part of the neighborhood.

===First Ward===
First Ward is located south of High Street in Morgantown. First Ward Elementary School was formerly located there; however, it was demolished and the playground area converted to Jack Roberts Park, one of two parks in the area along with White Park. Both include recreational facilities. The city's reservoir is in this neighborhood and sports several biking and hiking trails on almost all sides. The Mountaineer Mall, Morgantown's first mall, is located here, as are [[South Middle School (West Virginia)|South Middle School]] and the Monongalia County Technical Education Center. The Wharf District is located along the west side of First Ward, on the banks of the Monongahela River.

===South Park===
South Park is across [[Deckers Creek]] from downtown Morgantown. Originally farmland, it was one of the first suburbs of Morgantown. In the early 20th century, South Park saw a housing boom, with wealthy and influential citizens settling there. The neighborhood is home to [[Morgantown High School]], built in 1924 and recently expanded. The neighborhood is designated a historic district by the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

===Woodburn===
Woodburn was originally farmland on the hills to the east of downtown Morgantown. It encompasses the area enclosed by Richwood Avenue in the south and Willey Street in the north. Monongalia Avenue serves as the western boundary and the eastern boundary begins in the south at the intersection of Richwood Avenue and Darst Street, and continues north until Darst intersects with Willey Street at the beginning of the Mileground.

While originally home to small hillside farmsteads, Woodburn  in the late 19th century grew into a typical city neighborhood. Many of the street names, such as Louise Avenue, James Street, and Ridgeway Avenue, are named for early farm families, and many of the original farmhouses remain standing in the first decade of the 21st century. The area saw a rapid growth in population at the beginning of the 20th century as home to tinsmiths from [[Wales]] who came to work in the tinplate mill that later became the Sterling Faucet plant in Sabraton. A trolley line ran the length of Richwood Avenue and originally connected downtown with Sabraton. The Welsh community was active in the [[Methodist]] Church at the intersection of High Street and Willey Street, and held picnics in Whitmore Park, the main green space in Woodburn.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boparc.org/parksfacilities/details.php?iFacility=5 Boparc.org]{{dead link|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of these immigrants retained the [[Welsh language]], and as late as the 1930s it was common to hear Welsh spoken on the streets of Woodburn and the community was known for carrying on a traditional [[eisteddfod]] every year.  Woodburn Elementary School was the neighborhood school built in 1910.

Following [[World War II]], many new families came to Woodburn, attracted by the parkland, close proximity to downtown, community atmosphere, and nearby school. Actor [[David Selby]] spent his childhood living in Woodburn.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} In 1950, Tom and Anna Torch opened the Richwood Avenue Confectionary, a corner store and lunch counter that served beer in large Weiss goblets from the Morgantown Glassworks.  When they sold the operation in 1963 to Mario and Rose Spina, the establishment was nicknamed &quot;Marios Fishbowl&quot; in honor of the goblets.

A neighborhood newspaper was published here in the 1980s.

===Jerome Park===
Primarily residential, Jerome Park is located to the east of Woodburn. In June 2012, the city approved the purchase of 2.056 acres that includes the old Jerome Park Elementary School playground, and named this expanded park the Paul Preserve. The neighborhood also contains Whitemoore Park.

===Sabraton===
The site of the former tinplate mill that later became the Sterling Faucet plant, this neighborhood in its early days was connected to downtown Morgantown by a trolley line that ran the length of Richwood Avenue. Its amenities include the recreation area Marilla Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.boparc.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=78&amp;Itemid=5 | title= Marilla Park | publisher = Morgantown Board of Park an Recreation Commissioners | accessdate = December 14, 2012}}{{dead link|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
The city is served by Monongalia County Schools. Public elementary schools in Morgantown and its surrounding area include Cheat Lake, North, Brookhaven, Ridgedale, Mountainview, Mylan Park, and Skyview. There are four middle schools: Mountaineer Middle, [[South Middle School (West Virginia)|South]], Westwood, and Suncrest.&lt;ref name=&quot;MCS Middle Schools&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Middle Schools|url=http://boe.mono.k12.wv.us/schools/midschools.html|publisher=Monongalia County Schools|accessdate=January 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city's two high schools are [[University High School (Morgantown)|University High School]], the mascot of which is the [[Hawks]], and [[Morgantown High School]], whose mascot is the Mohigans. The latter's name is that of a non-existent [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribe whose name is a combination of the words Morgantown (MO) High (HIG) Annual (AN), which was the school's yearbook. The Native American mascot and logo were adopted because of the close relation to the name [[Mahican|Mohican]], a real Native American tribe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title =Morgantown High School - Mohigan Facts - The Mohigan|date =  2004-03-18|url = http://boe.mono.k12.wv.us/mhs/academics/mascot.html|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061013181048/http://boe.mono.k12.wv.us/mhs/academics/mascot.html|archivedate = 2006-10-13|accessdate = 2006-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Notable Morgantown High School alumni include [[screenwriter]]-[[film director]] [[Lawrence Kasdan]] (class of 1966), [[actor]] [[Don Knotts]] (class of 1942), [[college football]] coach [[Tommy Bowden]] (class of 1972), and [[TV]] [[college football]] analyst [[Terry Bowden]] (class of 1974).

In 2004, Suncrest Middle became a National Blue Ribbon School for the [[No Child Left Behind Act]].

Other private schools include: Covenant Christian School, Maranatha Christian Academy, Morgantown Christian Academy, [[Trinity Christian School (Morgantown, WV)|Trinity Christian School]], St. Francis Elementary/Middle School, and the alternative, non-religious Morgantown Learning Academy.

===Early schools===
While informal schools existed from Morgantown's earliest days,&lt;ref&gt;[[Earl L. Core|Core, Earl L.]], ''The Monongalia Story: A Bicentennial History, Vol. 3: Discord'' (Parsons, W.Va., McClain Printing Co., 1979), p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;  the town established a one-story, coeducational, Virginia common school in July 1803, that students attended on a tuition basis.&lt;ref&gt;Ambler, Charles Henry. ''A History of Education in West Virginia from Early Colonial Times to 1949'' (Huntington, W.Va., Standard Printing and Publishing Co., 1951), p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; On Nov. 29, 1814, the Virginia General Assembly incorporated '''Monongalia Academy''', the county's first [[Public school (government funded)|public school]].&lt;ref&gt;Core, pp. 26-27&lt;/ref&gt; Supported by obligatory [[Surveyor (surveying)|surveyor]]s' fees, the male-only institution was the equivalent of a modern-day [[high school]].&lt;ref&gt;Core, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; The Academy moved to a new two-story building in 1830, with principal Jonathan Haddock offering courses in [[geography]], surveying, and [[navigation]] in addition to traditional subjects. [[Presbyterian]] minister Reverend James Robertson Moore was principal during the Academy's 1852-1864 heyday, when its enrollment included students from 14 states.&lt;ref&gt;Core, p. 384&lt;/ref&gt; In 1867, the Academy closed, and donated its land toward the establishment of [[West Virginia University]].

The Virginia Assembly in March 1831 authorized the creation of the '''Morgantown Female Academy'''. Proceeds from the sale of the original Monongalia Academy building funded construction of a two-story school at Bumbo Lane (the modern-day Fayette Street) and Long Alley (the modern-day Chestnut Street). This school opened April 1, 1834.&lt;ref&gt;Core, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; After the Assembly approved a charter change in 1838, the school became known as the [[Methodist]] Academy.&lt;ref&gt;Core, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; This prompted local Presbyterians to create the '''Woodburn Female Seminary''', for which the Monongalia Academy's Rev. Moore also served as principal. The seminary closed in 1866, and its assets, like those of the Monongalia Academy, were donated toward the future university.

Following the 1863 creation of West Virginia, the new state's first legislature created a public-school system. The act provided for the education of &quot;free [[African American|colored]] children&quot;, and was adapted three years later to mandate education for all African-American children. However, a two-tier system was created: White children attended a regular term (at the second former Monongalia Academy building, purchased in 1867 from West Virginia Agricultural College, the future West Virginia University), only a short term was provided for African-Americans, who met at St. Paul's African Methodist Episcopal Church, on Beechurst Avenue.&lt;ref&gt;Core, pp. 54, 632&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman Catholic schools===
[[Image:St.-Francis-panorama-03.jpg|thumb|250px|St. Francis High School building, 2006]]
A [[Catholic school|Roman Catholic]] [[elementary school]], [[Saint Francis de Sales]], began sometime prior to 1915 as a two-room school in a house on McLane Avenue in the Seneca neighborhood, and run by lay teacher Miss Sterbutsal, who became Sister M. Isabelle of the Sisters of St. Joseph. In October 1915, the [[pastorate]] of Father Peter Flynn arranged for [[Ursuline Nuns of the Immaculate Conception|Ursuline]] nuns from [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], [[Kentucky]], and in 1918, under principal Sister M. Isadore, the school moved to a new building on Beechurst Avenue, adjacent to [[St. Theresa]]'s Church. On June 9, 1990, the grade school moved into the former St. Francis Central High School building,&lt;ref name=desales-history&gt;{{cite news|url=http://falcon.sfcc.pvt.k12.wv.us/history.shtm | title=History|  publisher= St Francis de Sales Central Catholic School| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070606080033/http://falcon.sfcc.pvt.k12.wv.us/history.shtm|archivedate = June 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually into newly built facility at 41 Guthrie Lane.&lt;ref&gt;[http://morgantowntimes.net/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=18 ''Morgantown Times'': &quot;St. Francis de Sales Central Catholic School Dedication: Bishop Michael Bransfield to Bless New Building&quot;] (press release, no date)&lt;/ref&gt; Its mascot is the [[Falcon]].&lt;ref name=desales-history /&gt; The Beechurst Avenue building was demolished in 2003.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

St. Francis Central High School existed for several decades on Birch Street in the Evansdale neighborhood until that campus was taken over by the elementary school on June 9, 1990.&lt;ref name=desales-history /&gt; Its mascot was the [[Troy|Trojans]],{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} and its football field was named for Father Flynn.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} The West Virginia University Foundation purchased its building and land in July 2003, formally selling it to WVU for $11 million in August 2004, with the university then announcing it intended to use the football and adjacent baseball fields as [[intramural sports|intramural]] recreation area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20080616123845/http://wvutoday.wvu.edu/news/page/4232/ WVU Today: (Sept. 2, 2004): &quot;WVU board authorizes salary increase package, facility plans&quot;] (press release)&lt;/ref&gt; Through January 2006, the building housed the St. Francis middle and elementary schools.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

==History==
* The settlement of Shinnston dates to the 1778 building of [[Levi Shinn House|Levi Shinn's log house]], whom the area was named after. It was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1973.&lt;ref name=&quot;nris&quot;&gt;{{NRISref|version=2010a}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1815, the town was laid out with three streets running parallel with the river and with four crossing streets running at right angles to them.
* The town was incorporated in 1852 as Shinn's Town by an act of the [[Virginia Legislature]], as West Virginia did not yet exist as an independent state, and Solomon S. Fleming was elected the first mayor.
* A new charter was secured in 1877 and the Town's name changed to Shinnston.
* In 1915, Shinnston's Charter provided for a Mayor-Council form of government. This model remained in place for over 70 years and in 1998 the citizens voted to revise the Charter and adopt a City Manager-Council form of local government. That model was implemented on July 1, 1998 and Shinnston now has its fourth City Manager.
* In the its beginnings the town was built around both Grain Mills and Saw Mills. In its early the years the town saw the development of a [[tanning|tannery]], [[wagon makers]] and [[undertaker]], [[mercantile]] interests, a [[pottery]], and a local [[newspaper]].
* The first Bank began in 1899.
* The railroad came to Shinnston in 1890.
* A trolley operated from 1906 to 1947.
* The first church was organized in 1786 and met in various homes in the community until 1835, when the first church building was erected.
* The first school was organized in 1813 with classes taught in a small log cabin. In 1860 a larger building was constructed for use as a town hall and academy. This venture became the first public school in 1865.  The first grade school was created in 1895 and Shinnston High School was added to it in 1907. In 1978, Shinnston and Lumberport High Schools were combined to form Lincoln High School.
* The [[Shinnston Historic District]] was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.&lt;ref name=&quot;nris&quot;/&gt;

==Notable people==
* [[Henry W. Bigler]], a soldier in the U.S. Mormon Battalion, one of the first discoverers of gold in California in 1848. 
* [[Dick Brown (baseball)|Dick Brown]], catcher in American Major League Baseball during the 1950s and 1960s.

==Rail transportation==
{{see also|Montgomery (Amtrak station)}}
The Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Railway used to stop in Montgomery all the way up until 1890. Back in 1890 Montgomery used to be called Cannelton. [[Amtrak]], the national passenger rail service, provides service to Montgomery from the [[Cardinal (train)|Cardinal]] route. [[CSX]] transportation's Kanawha Subdivision also runs through Montgomery. (The Amtrak runs on CSX trackage.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Montgomery, West Virginia|url=http://www.wvexp.com/index.php/Montgomery,_West_Virginia|publisher=WVExp.com|accessdate=2/4/13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trivia==
The novel &quot;Goodbye Miss 4th of July&quot;, written by Christopher Janus, is a biographical story of his Greek family's struggles while growing up in Montgomery. In 1988, a film version of &quot;Goodbye Miss 4th of July&quot; was produced by the Disney Channel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095240/ &quot;Goodbye Miss 4th of July&quot;]. [[Internet Movie Database]], retrieved 2011-06-03.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1890 Montgomery was called Cannelton. But from 1876 to 1890, the town was called Coal Valley Post Office, because of the post office and it was also influenced by the Coal Valley Coal Company. The name then changed to Montgomery's Landing to Coal Valley. Stores did not start getting large in numbers until 1895. The growth was due to the construction of the Kanawha &amp; Michigan Railroad across the river, the new bridge that crossed the water, and the connection of the Virginian Railway at Deepwater. Deepwater is only a couple of minutes from Montgomery. In the early 1910s Montgomery was the shipping center for 26 different coal operations. It was also the largest town in Fayette County at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Montgomery, West Virginia|url=http://www.wvexp.com/index.php/Montgomery,_West_Virginia|publisher=WVExp.com|accessdate=2/4/13|pages=1|date=June 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location and nomenclature==
[[File:Huntington Metro.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Map of the [[Huntington-Ashland-Ironton metropolitan area|
Greater Huntington Metro Area]].]]
Huntington is located in the southwestern corner of [[West Virginia]], along the border with [[Ohio]],  on the southern bank of the [[Ohio River]], at the [[confluence]] with the [[Guyandotte River]]. Most of the city is in Cabell County, for which it is the [[county seat]].{{GR|6}} A portion of the city, mainly the neighborhood of Westmoreland, is in [[Wayne County, West Virginia|Wayne County]]. Huntington is commonly divided into four main sections. The north/south divider is the [[CSX]] railroad tracks, while the east/west divider is First Street. Residents of Huntington are called &quot;Huntingtonians.&quot;

Although situated in a [[Southern United States|Southern state]], Huntington was originally considered a [[American frontier|western]] city. Huntington is influenced by [[Appalachia|Appalachian Culture]], [[Culture of the Southern United States|Southern culture]], [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern culture]], and [[Mid-Atlantic states|Mid-Atlantic culture]]. It is often referred to as either one of the northernmost cities in the [[Southern United States|South]], or one of the southernmost cities in the [[Union (American Civil War)|North]]. The [[Huntington–Ashland, WV–KY–OH, Metropolitan Statistical Area|Huntington Metro Area]] is sometimes referred to as '''KYOWVA''', an [[acronym]] that refers to the three states that make up the region, ([[Kentucky]], [[Ohio]], and [[West Virginia]]). As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the [[Huntington–Ashland, WV–KY–OH, Metropolitan Statistical Area|Huntington Metro Area]] is the largest in the State of [[West Virginia]] with a population of 365,419. Huntington is combined with [[Charleston, West Virginia]] as the Huntington-Charleston TV Market, which is currently the 64th-largest in the nation.&lt;ref name=&quot;m.whitehouse.gov&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;2011 estimate&quot;/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Collis Potter Huntington by William Keith, c1900.jpg|thumb|left|upright|200px|Collis P. Huntington, founder of the City of Huntington.]]
The first permanent settlement in modern-day Huntington was founded in 1775 as &quot;Holderby's Landing.&quot; The modern City of Huntington was founded by [[Collis P. Huntington]] and [[Delos W. Emmons]] as the western terminus for the [[Chesapeake and Ohio Railway]] (C&amp;O) on a tract of land west of the mouth of the [[Guyandotte River]], between the [[Ohio River]] and [[Four Pole Creek]]. Collis P. Huntington was one of the &quot;Big Four&quot; of western railroading who built the [[Central Pacific Railroad]] as part of the first U.S. transcontinental railroad (along with [[Leland Stanford]], [[Mark Hopkins, Jr.|Mark Hopkins]], and [[Charles Crocker]]).

Huntington was created as a railroad hub for the C&amp;O, which, once completed in 1873, fulfilled a long-held dream of the Virginias to have a rail link from the [[James River]] at [[Richmond, Virginia]] to the [[Ohio River Valley]]. The new railroad facilities adjacent to the Ohio River resulted in expansion of the former small town of Guyandotte into part of a large new city called &quot;Huntington.&quot; The C&amp;O Railroad expanded East to [[Newport News, Virginia|Newport News]] (and [[coal pier]]s), and West to eventually reach [[Cincinnati]] and Chicago in later years. After merging with several other railroads, C&amp;O is now known as [[CSX Transportation]].

The city was [[Incorporation (municipal government)|incorporated]] in 1871 just West of the earlier city of [[Guyandotte, West Virginia|Guyandotte]]. Guyandotte, which became a neighborhood of Huntington in 1891, was founded in 1799 on land that was originally part of the {{convert|28628|acre|km2|adj=on}} [[French and Indian War]] veteran's Savage Grant.&lt;ref name=&quot;City of Huntington&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=City of Huntington|title=Huntington History|url=http://www.cityofhuntington.com/pages/history.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meriwether Lewis passed the Guyandotte and Big Sandy River peninsula on or about September 20, 1803 on his way down the Ohio River before meeting up with William Clark in Clarksville, Indiana.

[[File:Huntington Trolley.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Trolley bus No. 9 on Fourth Avenue]]
Huntington was the second American city to feature electric street cars in the early years (after [[San Francisco]]), until they were gradually replaced with gasoline-powered buses. Some of the old trolley tracks can still be seen on a few streets. Camden Park,  which at 110 years old is one of the world’s oldest amusement parks, was built in 1903 to encourage ridership on the trolleys (then owned by the Camden Interstate Railway Company).

Huntington’s &quot;[[Boomtown|boom]]&quot; period occurred from the founding in 1871 until the [[Ohio River Flood of 1937|Great Flood of 1937]], which claimed 5 lives, caused millions of dollars in damage, left tens of thousands homeless, and led to the creation of Huntington’s floodwalls in 1938.
Of the 40,000 people living in the flooded areas of Huntington, 25,000 were made refugees as fresh water and fuel was scarce. 11,000 people applied for Red Cross aid during the flood and the relief period.

[[File:Looking west on Fourth Avenue during the 1937 Flood.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Fourth Avenue during the Great Flood of 1937.]]
[[World War II]] brought another economic boom, but that was short-lived and ended along with the war in the 1940s. Huntington’s population began to drop after 1950 due to [[urban sprawl]] and the [[rust belt|decline of the steel and manufacturing industries]]. In the 1970s, federal [[urban renewal]] programs destroyed several parts of Downtown. The industrial base continued to expand through the 1970s, but beginning in the early 1980s the steel and manufacturing industry in the region imploded, with massive layoffs and mill and plant closures.

Beginning in the late 1980s, the city shifted its economic base to education, tourism, and services, largely based on healthcare/medicine and biotechnology. Although Huntington successfully shifted the focus of its economy and remains a viable city, the city's population has never rebounded to its industrial-era highs. While 86,353 people lived in the city proper in 1950, a combination of suburbanization and economic turbulence caused a sharp decrease in city population to just 51,475 in the year 2000.

===21st century===
[[File:Pullman Square Flowers and Fountain.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Pullman Square]]
Huntington has seen a major revival since the opening of the [[Pullman Square]] Town Center on the vacant lot formerly known as the &quot;Superblock&quot; in 2005, the filming of the [[Warner Bros.]] motion picture [[We Are Marshall]] in 2006, and the filming of ABC’s [[Jamie Oliver's Food Revolution|Food Revolution]] in 2010. During the [[late 2000s recession]], Huntington remained economically strong, adding jobs when most cities were losing them, and becoming one of the few cities in the United States to see housing property values rise. As of the most recent census in 2010, the city population is on the rise for the first time in 6 decades. The modern [[Huntington-Ashland-Ironton metropolitan area|Huntington Metro Area]] spans 7 counties across 3 states and is the largest in the state of [[West Virginia]] with a population of more than 360,000. The largest employers are [[Marshall University]], [[Cabell Huntington Hospital]], [[St. Mary's Medical Center (Huntington)|St. Mary’s Medical Center]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], [[DirecTV]], and the City of Huntington.&lt;ref name=&quot;Huntington in Bloom&quot; /&gt;

Shortly after Pullman Square was constructed, the city began work on upgrading the street scape on Fourth Avenue and Ninth Street. Ninth Street was formerly known as the Ninth Street Plaza and was closed to vehicle traffic for years, which effectively killed most businesses located there. Once anchored by Pullman Square on the north end, the old plaza was removed in 2006 and Ninth Street has once again become attractive to new businesses. Fourth Avenue, known as the &quot;Old Main Corridor,&quot; continues to be upgraded yearly with new lighting, artistic and pedestrian-friendly design concepts, and bicycle lanes.

[[File:BigSandySuperstoreArena.JPG|thumb|300px|left|The Big Sandy Superstore Arena.]]
Efforts to redevelop Huntington started with the construction of the $10.5 million [[Big Sandy Superstore Arena|Huntington Civic Arena]], which was the largest arena in the state when it opened in 1977. The 25-year delay in construction of what became Pullman Square caused the building to become a money losing effort for the city and is now managed privately by [[SMG (property management)|SMG]]. After renovation in 1997, and 2010, the arena has now been included in [[Billboard Magazine]]'s &quot;New or Renovated Venues to Watch&quot; list for 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.herald-dispatch.com/news/briefs/x455064691/Huntington-arena-named-a-venue-to-watch&lt;/ref&gt; Huntington's arena landed at No. 14 in a list of 17 venues across the globe.

The [[Huntington Mall]], the largest mall in the state of West Virginia, opened a few years after the Arena in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.herald-dispatch.com/news/communities/x1620952801 |title=Sense of community keeps Barboursville growing |accessdate=2008-03-13 |date=2007-10-24 |work=The Herald-Dispatch}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the mall was built, the only other businesses around it were two bars and an [[Exxon]] gas station. Since the mall's opening, several retailers have built around the mall, including four hotels and several restaurants, as well as a [[Walmart]] Supercenter, the first [[Best Buy]] in West Virginia, and the first [[Sheetz]] gas station/convenience store in southern West Virginia.&lt;ref name=&quot;affected&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.herald-dispatch.com/specialsections/100years/x613396146/TOP-STORY-Huntington-Mall-has-affected-entire-region|title=Huntington Mall has affected entire region|last=Rosenberger|first=Bill|date=2009-01-15|work=The Herald-Dispatch|accessdate=2009-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Huntington Mall has a yearly economic impact of close to $400 million.

[[File:HeritageStation.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Huntington Welcome Center and the Shops at Heritage Station, as seen from across Veteran's Memorial Blvd.]]
The Shops at Heritage Station are located in the old [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Depot (Huntington, West Virginia)|Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Depot]] which was originally constructed in 1887. The complex includes an original steam engine with a “pullman” train car, and a building that used to house one of Huntington’s first banks—which was the easternmost bank robbed by the [[James-Younger Gang]]. That structure is currently occupied by a specialty beer and cheese shop. Heritage Station was turned into a shopping center called “Heritage Village” during the dark days of Urban Renewal in the 1970s. For decades, the beautiful station sat hidden and virtually unused just two blocks from the city center, until Create Huntington got involved in 2006. Happily, today Heritage Station is a busy artisan retail complex, full of locally-owned shops, and home to regular public events like the annual Diamond Teeth Mary Blues Festival.

===Marshall University===
{{Main|Marshall University}}

At the time of Huntington's founding, Holderby's Landing was already the home of [[Normal School|Marshall College State Normal School]] (now [[Marshall University]]). The university was founded in 1837 as a private [[secondary school|subscription school]] by residents of Guyandotte and the surrounding area. The landmark [[Old Main (Marshall University)|Old Main]], which now serves as the primary administrative building for the university, was built on land known as Maple Grove, at the time the home of the Mount Hebron Church in what was then the [[US state|state]] of [[Virginia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;OM_1837&quot;&gt;Brown, Lisle, ed.[http://www.marshall.edu/library/speccoll/virtual_museum/old_main/1837-building.asp &quot;Marshall Academy, 1837.&quot;] Marshall University Special Collections. Sept. 1, 2004, Dec 20. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Laidley]], a local [[Lawyer|attorney]], hosted the meeting which led to the founding of Marshall Academy, which was named after Laidley's friend, the eminent [[John Marshall]]&lt;ref name=&quot;OM_1837&quot;/&gt; who had served as the fourth [[Chief Justice of the United States]] from January 1801 to July 1835.

On March 30, 1838, the institution was formally dedicated by the [[Virginia General Assembly]] as Marshall Academy.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Virgil A.

Dec. 20, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In 1858, the [[Virginia General Assembly]] changed the name to Marshall College.&lt;ref name=real&gt;[http://www.marshall.edu/muhistory/REAL/REAL.asp Becoming A Real College: 1910–1929]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tour_EarlyYears&quot;&gt;[http://www.marshall.edu/muhistory/EARLY/EARLY.asp &quot;The Early Years.&quot;] Marshall University. 1997. Dec. 20, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; On June 20, 1863, [[Cabell County, West Virginia|Cabell County, Virginia]], was one of the [[Former counties, cities, and towns of Virginia|50 counties]] separated from Virginia at the height of the [[American Civil War]] to form the State of [[West Virginia]], and the college fell within the new state. In 1867, the [[West Virginia Legislature]] rededicated the institution as a teacher training facility and renamed it State Normal School of Marshall College.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tour_EarlyYears&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OM_1856&quot;&gt;Brown, Lisle, ed. [http://www.marshall.edu/library/speccoll/virtual_museum/old_main/1856-building.asp &quot;Marshall Academy, 1856.&quot;] Marshall University Special Collections. Sept. 1, 2004, Dec 20. 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  This began the history of the college as a state-supported post-secondary institution.

The university is currently composed of eight undergraduate colleges and schools: the College of Liberal Arts (COLA), the College of Fine Arts (COFA), the College of Education and Human Services (COEHS), the College of Information Technology and Engineering (CITE), the Elizabeth McDowell Lewis College of Business (LCOB), the College of Science (COS), the College of Health Professions (COHP), and the W. Page Pitt School of Journalism and Mass Communications (SOJMC), and four graduate colleges, the general Graduate College, the Graduate School of Education and Professional Development, the School of Pharmacy, and the [[Joan C. Edwards School of Medicine]], a regional center for cancer research which has a national reputation for its programs in rural health care delivery. On July 1, 2013, the College of Education and the Graduate School of Education and Professional Development will merge into a single College of Educaton operating both the undergraduate and graduate levels and the College of Fine Arts and School of Journalism and Mass Communications will merge into a single college which has yet to be named.

Marshall's sports teams are known as the &quot;Thundering Herd&quot;. The home field for the football program is James F. Edwards Field at the [[Joan C. Edwards Stadium]]. The basketball programs play at the [[Cam Henderson Center]]. The soccer programs will play at Veterans Memorial Soccer Stadium (under construction), and the baseball teams are awaiting a new stadium. The school colors are kelly green and white. Marshall participates in [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] ([[Division I (NCAA)#Division I-A|FBS]] for [[American football|football]]) as a member of [[Conference USA]]. The name Thundering Herd came from a [[Zane Gray]] novel released in 1925, and a silent movie of the same two years later. Marshall teams were originally known as the Indians, and the green-white colors came in 1903, replacing black and blue. [[The Herald-Dispatch]] sports editor Carl &quot;Duke&quot; Ridgley tagged the team with the Thundering Herd name, but many other nicknames were suggested over the next thirty years, including Boogercats, Big Green, Green Gobblers, Rams, Judges and others. In 1965, students, alums and faculty settled on Thundering Herd in a vote, and Big Green was given to the athletic department's fund-raising wing. Sports at the school include women's [[softball]], [[swimming (sport)|swimming]] &amp; [[diving]], [[tennis]], [[volleyball]], and [[track &amp; field]]; men's [[American football|football]], [[baseball]]; and teams for both genders in [[basketball]] [[cross country running|cross country]], [[golf]], and [[soccer]].&lt;ref name=&quot;herdzone&quot;&gt;http://herdzone.cstv.com/s-finder/mars-s-finder.html&lt;/ref&gt; Marshall also fields club teams, not affiliated with the MU Athletic Department, in [[rugby union]] for both women and men, men's and women's [[lacrosse]], and an equestrian team that competes in the [[Intercollegiate Horse Show Association]].

==Geography==
[[File:HWV RegionalMap.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Map of the geographical regions around Huntington]]
Huntington is located in the southwestern corner of [[West Virginia]], along the border with [[Ohio]],  on the southern bank of the [[Ohio River]], at the [[confluence]] with the [[Guyandotte River]]. The city lies within the [[ecoregion]] of the [[Western Allegheny Plateau (ecoregion)|Western Allegheny Plateau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Level III Ecoregions of West Virginia|url=http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/cropmap/wvirginia/maps/WVeco3.html Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory|publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=29 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the city is in Cabell County, for which it is the [[county seat]].{{GR|6}} A portion of the city, mainly the neighborhood of Westmoreland, is in [[Wayne County, West Virginia|Wayne County]]. Huntington is commonly divided into four main sections. The north/south divider is the [[CSX]] railroad tracks, while the east/west divider is First Street. Residents of Huntington are called &quot;Huntingtonians.&quot;

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|18.46|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which, {{convert|16.22|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|2.24|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.&lt;ref name =&quot;Gazetteer files&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2013-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Guyandotte River]] joins the [[Ohio River]] about {{convert|5|mi|sp=us}} east of downtown Huntington. Huntington fills the roughly three-mile wide [[flood plain]] of the south bank of the Ohio River for eighty [[city block|square blocks]] and portions of the hills to the immediate south and southeast.

===Climate===
Due to its position in the westernmost and lowest altitude areas of the state, the city is on the northern limits of a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfa''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wchstv.com/newsroom/wx/climatesummary.shtml |title=Charleston-Huntington Climate Summary – Eyewitness News Storm Team Weather |publisher=Wchstv.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; unlike the [[Highland (geography)|&quot;highlands&quot;]] of West Virginia which are located in the [[Allegheny Mountains]] and the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. Huntington is made humid by the Ohio River, but summers are not as hot as they are further south and west. Snowfall generally falls in moderate amounts, accumulating an average {{convert|23|in|cm|0}} seasonally, and the greatest 24-hour fall was {{convert|21.1|in|cm}} during the March [[1993 Storm of the Century]]. On average, there are 24 days that reach {{convert|90|°F|1}} and 16−17 days annually that stay below freezing. The highest recorded temperature was {{convert|108|°F|0}} on July 28, 1930, and the lowest was {{convert|−24|°F|0}} on [[Great Blizzard of 1899|February 9, 1899]].

{{Main|Cityscape of Huntington, West Virginia}}
[[File:Old Main Corridor.jpg|thumb|300px|The Old Main Corridor, as seen from [[Marshall University]] in May of 2013.]]

Huntington has a central business district, located directly between the [[Ohio River]] and the CSX Railroad track, east of the [[Robert C. Byrd Bridge]], and west of Hal Greer Blvd (16th Street). There are also 2 smaller business districts, one known as &quot;Old Central City,&quot; that is well known for its antique shops, the other is in Guyandotte. The city also has a wealth of architecture, including Gothic, Art Deco, and Edwardian Renaissance, along with many Craftsman, Colonial, Classical, and Tudor Revival homes.

Shortly after Pullman Square was constructed, the city began upgrading the street scape on 9th Street and the &quot;Old Main Corridor&quot; section of 4th Avenue. 9th Street was formerly known as the Ninth Street Plaza and was closed to vehicle traffic for years, which effectively killed most businesses located there. Once anchored by Pullman Square on the north end, the old plaza was removed in 2006 and 9th Street has once again begun attracting new businesses. The section of Fourth Avenue that connects Downtown to Marshall University, known as the &quot;Old Main Corridor,&quot; has also been upgraded recently. The corridor is being upgraded yearly with new lighting, artistic and pedestrian-friendly design concepts, and bicycle lanes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.city-data.com/us-cities/The-South/Huntington-Economy.html |title=Huntington: Economy – Major Industries and Commercial Activity |publisher=City-data.com |date= |accessdate=January 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:StoneAndThomasRenovation.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Historic Third Avenue across from Pullman Square, showing the renovation of the old [[Stone &amp; Thomas]] Building.]]
[[Marshall University]] recently purchased the old Anderson-Newcomb/[[Stone &amp; Thomas]] Building, which was built in 1902, with the intent of converting that historic structure into a state-of-the-art visual arts center. The goal being to raise the college’s presence as an innovative institution, give the visual art program more space to expand, and afford students more opportunities to become engaged in community initiatives and improve the quality of life for everyone in the city.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marshall.edu/cofa/art/&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its founding as the western terminus of the C&amp;O Railroad, Huntington has served as a major break of bulk point between rail traffic and the [[Ohio River]]/[[Mississippi River]] [[Drainage basin|watershed]]. The Huntington Division is still the largest in the [[CSX Transportation]] network. A large portion of the division's revenue comes from hauling coal out of the coalfields of [[West Virginia]] and Eastern [[Kentucky]]. The Huntington District and is the largest of 10 operating divisions on the network. It serves the states of Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia and Ohio. CSX's Huntington Division main office is located in the historical former C&amp;O passenger station in downtown Huntington.&lt;ref name=&quot;facebook&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/pages/CSX-Huntington-Division-Photography-and-Videography-HDPV/182716188518297?id=182716188518297&amp;sk=info&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several heavy industrial plants that line the Ohio River and the [[Guyandotte River]] including the '[[Port of Huntington-Tristate]], which is the largest port in [[West Virginia]] and the 8th-largest in the United States. It is the largest inland port in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;ace&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ndc.iwr.usace.army.mil//wcsc/pdf/wcusnatl09.pdf |title=Waterborne Commerce of the United States: Volume 5 |accessdate=2011-11-07 |publisher=US Army Corps of Engineers |author=US Army Corps of Engineers |format=PDF |year=2010|page=5-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Included in the port's area is 100 miles of the [[Ohio River]] from the mouth of the [[Scioto River]] in [[Portsmouth, Ohio]] to the northern border of [[Gallia County, Ohio]], 9 miles of the [[Big Sandy River (Ohio River)|Big Sandy River]], and 90 miles of the [[Kanawha River]].&lt;ref name=&quot;hdwa&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://huntingtonwaterways.com/ |title=Huntington District Waterways Association |accessdate=2011-11-07 |publisher=Huntington District Waterways Association |author=Huntington District Waterways Association |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neighborhoods===
Huntington is commonly divided into four main sections. The north/south divider is the [[CSX]] railroad tracks, while the east/west divider is First Street.

===Downtown Historic District===
[[File:Reattaching the Keith Albee Sign.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Keith-Albee Theatre|Keith Albee]]'s sign being reinstalled over Fourth Avenue in the [[Downtown Huntington Historic District|Downtown Historic District]] in 2012.]] 
The [[Downtown Huntington Historic District]] is a national [[Historic district (United States)|historic district]] located at Huntington, [[Cabell County, West Virginia]]. The original district encompassed 59 contributing buildings; the boundary increase added 53 more contributing buildings. It includes the central business district of Huntington, and includes several of its municipal and governmental buildings. It contains the majority of the historic concentration of downtown commercial buildings.

Notable buildings include the Huntington City Hall, Johnson Memorial Church (c.1886/1912/1935), Trinity Episcopal Church (1882), Davis Opera House (c. 1885), Love Hardware Building (c. 1884), the Broh Building (1885), Reuschleins Jewelry building (1923), the Anderson-Newcomb/[[Stone &amp; Thomas]] Building (c. 1902), the Frederick Building (1906) the Morrison Building (1919), [[Keith-Albee Theater]] (1928), West Virginia Building (c. 1924), and the Gideon Building (c. 1915).

A boundary increase occurred in 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;nris&quot;/&gt;

Arguably, the most famous attraction in Huntington is  [[Keith-Albee Theatre]], a former [[Vaudeville]] palace in the &quot;Art Deco&quot; style from the 1920s and one of the architectural masterpieces of Downtown Huntington, located along Fourth Avenue. Now known as the Keith Albee Performing Arts Center, the Keith was originally built in 1928 as the Keith-Albee Theater, and under the supervision of vaudeville tycoons B. F. Keith and Edward Albee as part of their Keith-Albee vaudeville circuit, the Keith-Albee was the second-largest theater in the United States at that time—behind the Roxy in New York City. The theater was designed by [[Thomas W. Lamb]] who designed approximately 153 theaters around the world. Unfortunately, only forty-three of these grand theaters are still open, and seventy-one have been demolished. Thankfully, &quot;the Keith&quot; has been undergoing a full restoration since 2009.

The signature achievement in the restoration of the Keith, was the restoration of the famous front sign in 2012. After standing watch over Fourth Avenue for decades and being featured in hundreds of pictures and postcards, two Hollywood movie premieres, and being struck by lightning numerous times; the sign had to be taken down in 2011. A massive &quot;Save Our Sign&quot; effort was organized that funded the full restoration of the sign, which was reinstalled in May 2012.

===Public health issues===
A report issued by the Centers for Disease Control August 15, 2008, using survey data from 2006, reported that Huntington is among the unhealthiest cities in America. The survey found that 24.3% of adults 18 years-of-age or older reported themselves as in poor to fair health.[15] The survey also found that 48.1% of residents over 65 years of age in the Huntington-Ashland, West Virginia-Kentucky-Ohio statistical area had all their natural teeth extracted. In addition, the CDC reports that 45.5% of adults over the age of 20 years are obese. 21.6% of adults over 45 years of age reported a diagnosis of coronary heart disease while another 12.7% of adults aged 18 or older reported a diagnosis of diabetes. An Associated Press article describes lifestyle and cultural barriers as obstacles to better public health.[16] As examples, the article describes local eating habits (the number of pizza shops in Huntington alone exceeding the total number of health clubs available in the entire state of West Virginia), the relatively sedentary culture, and poor education as causes for health issues described in the CDC report. In an MSNBC report published November 16, 2008, Huntington was rated as the unhealthiest city in the United States. The study took into consideration obesity rates, toothlessness and levels of healthcare.

Despite the high levels of obesity, the lack of basic dental care, and some of the highest incidents of diabetes and heart disease in the United States, Huntington city leaders have not identified the general unhealthy population as a significant problem. Former Huntington Mayor, David Felinton, has said, referring to the Huntington's public health problems, &quot;It doesn't come up.&quot;

As a consequence of Huntington's high rates of obesity, diabetes and coronary heart disease, Huntington was selected by Jamie Oliver to be the location of his television series, Jamie Oliver's Food Revolution.

Huntington has, since 1985, operated under a [[strong mayor]]/[[city council]] form of government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[The Associated Press]]|title=Huntington Charter|date=March 27, 2006|url=http://wowktv.com/story.cfm?func=viewstory&amp;storyid=9721|accessdate=June 15, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mayor is elected to four-year terms in partisan elections contested at the same time as [[United States presidential election]]s. The current mayor is former at-large councilman [[Stephen T. Williams|Steve Williams]], a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] who is currently in his first term.

The city also serves as the [[county seat]] of Cabell County.{{GR|6}} The Cabell County Courthouse is located in downtown Huntington on a parcel that covers an entire city block. Within the building are the offices for all of the county's elected officials and their employees, including the [[sheriff]], [[county commission]]ers, [[county clerk]], [[magistrates]], and Circuit Court [[judge]]s.

Huntington's city councilmembers are also elected to four-year terms at the same time as the mayor. There are eleven members of the council, nine of whom represent single-member districts, while the other two are elected at-large by the city as a whole. Huntington's city council has the authority to draft and debate ordinances and can override a mayoral veto with a two-thirds majority. There are currently nine [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] and two [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] on the city council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Clerk of Cabell County|title=2008 Cabell County Election Results|date=November 4, 2008|url=http://www.huntingtonnews.net/local/el45.html|accessdate=February 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law enforcement==
[[File:HPDOfficers.jpg|300px|thumbnail|left|Members of the Huntington Police Department standing outside Police Headquarters (The Jean Dean Public Safety Building) in 2012.]]
The [[Huntington Police Department (HPD)|Huntington Police Department]] (HPD), founded in 1872, is the primary law enforcement agency serving the citizens of Huntington. The citizens of Huntington are protected by 106 sworn officers and a professional support staff of 11 civilians. Citing double-digit drops in overall crime, and drops of more than 20% in violent crime, HPD has been recognized by the U.S. Attorney's Office as the &quot;Law Enforcement Agency of the Year&quot; for 2011 and 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hpdwv.com/about.php&lt;/ref&gt;

Law enforcement and security for Marshall University is provided by the Marshall University Police Department. This protection includes the main campus area (including the streets on or immediately surrounding campus) as well as all other university owned or managed buildings and property, including the Marshall University Medical Center at Cabell Huntington Hospital.

As the enforcement arm of the [[Cabell County]] court system, the Cabell County Sheriff's Office is responsible for the security of the Court House and property, public schools, service of court-ordered writs, protective and peace orders, warrants, tax levies, prisoner transportation and traffic enforcement. Deputy Sheriffs are sworn law enforcement officials, with full arrest authority anywhere in Cabell County granted by the constitution of West Virginia and the county Sheriff.

In addition to both municipal and county law enforcement agencies, Huntington is also home to a detachment of the [[West Virginia State Police]]. This detachment covers both Cabell and Wayne counties and can serve as a backup to any neighboring counties.

==Huntington Fire Department==
[[File:HFDTrucksAtStationOne.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Huntington Fire Department trucks at Station #1.]]
The city of Huntington is protected by 98 professional firefighters of the Huntington Fire Department (HFD), founded in 1897. The department currently provides nine fully staffed companies with a compliment of support staff and apparatus responding from six strategically located fire stations throughout the city. The six stations consist of six engine companies, two ladder trucks, a rescue truck, a marine unit, and several reserve engines, reserve utility trucks, and staff vehicles.

Huntington is located on the Southern banks of the Ohio River and its tributaries, and is the river's largest port area. The Huntington Fire Department is capable of water/underwater rescue operations and is the host locality to the Regional # 6 West Virginia Regional Response Team which provides Hazardous Materials and Technical Rescue Team responses. The Department holds a Class 2 rating from the Insurance Services Office (ISO) and was the first department in the State to achieve this status. Last departmental evaluation was performed in 2010.

===History===
The problem of organizing for protection against fire was not given much thought until 1874 when A.C. Young and a group of associates organized a hook and ladder company. Mr. Young was given City Council authorized to contract for a hand drawn hook and ladder truck. The Council approved $450.00 toward the purchase of the new truck. It was built locally by Mr. M.A. Jones and Huntington's first fire company was born. In 1874, the city council enacted an ordinance creating a fire department to consist of an Engine Company, a Hose Company, and the previously formed Hook &amp; Ladder Company. Mr. S. Sexton was named fire chief and the personnel was all volunteer. May 1875 the city purchased a hand operated engine and a hand-drawn hose reel from Portsmouth, Ohio, for $725.00. To provide a water supply for the department, large 500 gallon cisterns were made in numerous locations in the city. On August 5, 1875 the organization was complete and the department was ready for action. A tower bell for alarms was bought in 1875 and more cisterns were placed in 1876.

[[File:HFDFireBox.jpg|200px|thumbnail|left|An original Gamewell Fire Alarm Box in front of Centennial Fire Station No. 1.]]
Thomas Sikes was Captain of Hook and Ladder Co. No. 1, and Eustance Gibson was Captain of Excelsior Fire Engine and Hose Co. No. 2. Both men were Civil War veterans, well known and respected early settlers. Many of the volunteer personnel composed of well known early settlers, merchants and professional men, many of whose descendants are living in Huntington today. In 1876 a night-watchman was hired at $3.00 per month to look after the station at night and sound the alarm in case of a fire. This was the first paid employee of the fire department. In 1879 J.W. Verlander became the first Fire Chief, and J.M. Boone became chief in 1880 until 1895. In 1881, four Gamewell Fire Alarm Boxes were installed in the downtown area. These fire alarm boxes were maintained by the telephone company. The system kept growing, and in 1928 construction was completed on a new Gamewell Fire Alarm System and Fire Alarm Headquarters were placed in operation in 1929, and remained in service until 7:32AM November 1, 1986. The Gamewell Fire Alarm System served the City of Huntington faithfully for 105 years. There never was a loss of life or major disaster because of a system malfunction.

In 1883 the department first and only horse-drawn steam fire engine was purchased from the Ahrens-Fox Fire Engine Company of Cincinnati, Ohio. The engine was brought up the Ohio River to Huntington, WV on a steamboat. Also in 1883 the department was reorganized on a part-paid basis, but continued to be largely volunteer until 1897 when the department was again reorganized with a paid Chief, four paid drivers and a force of firefighters who were paid by each alarm they answered. Each firefighter held down regular jobs the rest of the time. This was the beginning of Huntington's full-time paid fire department.

In the years from 1913 to 1915 five pieces of motorized equipment were bought for  the department. These consisted of a chiefs car, two hose trucks, a pumping engine and a {{convert|85|ft|abbr=on}} aerial ladder truck. This was the beginning of motorization. In April 1926 the last two teams of horse drawn hose companies were lead away from Hose Companies No. 5 in Guyandotte and No. 6 in Walnut Hills.. The day of the dashing fire horse was over. The old St. Clouds Fire Station is the city's reminder of the horse drawn era. The horse bitten window sills still remain today.

In February, 1929 Huntington's fire fighters were issued a charter establishing a local union. Under the International Association of Fire Fighters, Huntington's fire fighters were given the 289th local in the U.S. and Canada

[[File:FirePreventionParade2010.jpg|thumb|300px|The 2010 Fire Prevention Parade on Fourth Avenue.]]
The Fire Prevention Bureau was established in the early fifties, because of the increasing number of fires in homes and businesses, along with the city's Fire Prevention Week. Early functions of the Bureau included the Fire Prevention Parade and a contest to select Miss Flame, a beauty queen to reign over the weeks activities. All contestants in the competition were required to have red hair in the earlier years. The Fire Prevention Parade was held the first Monday in October, and a tradition that is carried on today since the fifties. Fire Departments from West Virginia, Ohio, and Kentucky participate annually in Huntington's Fire Prevention Parade. The Huntington Fire Department implemented the School Fire Patrol Program in the city in 1950. This programs said to be one of the oldest in the nation today. Other events in the mid to late fifties included the establishment of the Tri-State Fire School. The Tri-State Fire School is still used today to train firefighters.

In 1965, the city built its first new fire station since 1926. The city's 100th birthday was commemorated when the Centennial Fire Station was placed in service on January 13, 1972, replacing the long-outmoded Central Fire Station. The Centennial Fire Station is still in service today. In 2004, a new station was opened that replaced St. Cloud station 4. The old station has been in service as a fire house for over 100 years. It now houses the traffic division for the City Of Huntington. The 1980s were tough for the department, several firefighters retired, and budget cuts forced the closure of several stations. The Gamewell Fire Alarm System was deactivated and Fire Alarm Headquarters closed. (The Old Fire Alarm Headquarters has been converted into a fire museum today.) Dispatching was combined with the Police Department, marking the beginning of 911 emergency dispatching.

==Health care==
[[File:Smmc-heart-er.jpg|right|thumb|300px|St. Mary's Medical Center's new regional heart institute and emergency department.]]
The two largest hospitals in Huntington are [[St. Mary's Medical Center (Huntington)|St. Mary's Medical Center]] and [[Cabell Huntington Hospital]]. St. Mary's and Cabell-Huntington are jointly designated as the only trauma center in the region. St. Mary's is the largest medical facility in the tri-state region. The medical center is the largest private employer in [[Cabell County, West Virginia|Cabell County]] with over 2,600 employees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.st-marys.org/about About St. Mary’s &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; As a teaching facility associated with the Joan C. Edwards [[Marshall University]] School of Medicine, St. Mary's trains medical residents in several specialties. The hospital campus is home to the St. Mary's School of Nursing, the St. Mary's School of Radiologic Technology, and the St. Mary’s School of Respiratory Care. All three programs are associated with Marshall University. St. Mary's is also home to a regional heart institute, regional cancer center, and regional neuroscience center.

[[File:Cabell Huntington Hospital.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Cabell-Huntington Hospital viewed along Hal Greer Blvd.]]
Cabell Huntington Hospital is a not-for-profit, regional referral center with 303 staffed beds. Cabell Huntington cares for patients from more than 29 counties throughout West Virginia, Kentucky and Ohio. Opened in 1956, it is also a teaching hospital and home to the Marshall University Medical Center, which includes the Joan C. Edwards Schools of Medicine and Nursing. Cabell Huntington is also home to the Edwards Comprehensive Cancer Center, the Hoops Family Children's Hospital, and the Robert C. Byrd Center for Rural Health; a distinguished leader nationwide for rural health care delivery.

[[File:HuntingtonVAHospital.JPG|thumb|300px|The main building of the Huntington VA Hospital.]]
The Huntington [[Veteran's Administration]] (VA) Medical Center, located on Spring Valley Drive, is an 80-bed medical and surgical care facility that offers primary inpatient and outpatient care, along with mental health services and subspeciality outpatient options. It is also the primary teaching facility for the Marshall University School of Medicine and is also affiliated with the [[Pikeville College School of Osteopathic Medicine]]. In 1993, the [[Robert C. Byrd]] Clinical Addition expanded the hospital's surgery, radiology, laboratory, cardiology, nuclear medicine, and rehabilitation services and renovated inpatient care facilities. In 1998, a $10 million research facility was completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.va.gov/directory/guide/facility.asp?ID=749&amp;dnum=ALL&amp;map=1 |title= Huntington VA Medical Center, Department of Veteran Affairs | accessdate=10 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hospital is also the home of the [[Marshall University]] School of Pharmacy.

The city is also home to the state's largest psychiatric hospital, Mildred Mitchell-Bateman Hospital.

==Economy==
[[File:Amazon Customer Service Center Huntington.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Amazon.com|Amazon Customer Service Center]] in Kinetic Park.]]
The growth of Huntington and its economy was originally based on steel processing, shipping, manufacturing, and transportation through the 1970s, then the city experienced [[deindustrialization]] which cost residents tens of thousands of low-skill, high-wage jobs. Huntington has since been adapting to the collapse of the region's steel industry. The primary industries have shifted to high technology, such as, the film and television industries, health care, [[biomedical technology]], finance, tourism, and the service sector. The Amazon Customer Service Center in Huntington employees approximately 500-700 people.

Huntington has grown its economic base in recent years to include technology, retail, finance, education, and medical care (which constitutes the largest proportion of the city's employment). The largest employers are [[Marshall University]], [[Cabell Huntington Hospital]], [[St. Mary's Medical Center (Huntington)|St. Mary’s Medical Center]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], [[DirecTV]], and the City of Huntington.&lt;ref name=&quot;Huntington in Bloom&quot; /&gt;

Area retail is anchored by the [[Huntington Mall]], the largest mall in the state of [[West Virginia]], and a healthy downtown retail sector including many boutique shops along the Old Main Corridor, Third Avenue, and Pullman Square.

The newest area of development in the city is Kinetic Park. Kinetic Park is a premier technology park located on Sixteenth Street, 1/4 mile north of [[interstate 64]]. The flagship of the development is [[Amazon.com|Amazon]]'s new 70,000 sq. ft. Customer Service Center, which opened in November 2011. Other development in Kinetic Park includes a Spring Hill Suites by Marriott hotel, a Hampton Inn hotel, a Bob Evans restaurant, Goldy Chrysler, and the Huntington Pediatric Dentistry and Orthodontics clinic.

The first large manufacturing business in Huntington was the Ensign Car Works, which was founded in Huntington, West Virginia, in 1872 by [[Ely Ensign]] and [[William Henry Barnum|William H. Barnum]], who managed a car wheel manufacturing company, the Barnum and Richardson Company, in [[Connecticut]]. The company was incorporated on November 1, 1872.&lt;ref name=MCRM&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.midcontinent.org/rollingstock/builders/ensign.htm| title=Ensign Manufacturing Company| publisher=Mid-Continent Railway Museum| date=2006-04-09| accessdate=2008-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Financing was provided primarily by Barnum and [[Collis Potter Huntington|Collis P. Huntington]], who was one of the principals in the [[Central Pacific Railroad]] and founder of the City of Huntington.&lt;ref&gt;White, p 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the first ten years of production, Ensign manufactured iron parts such as railroad car wheels. The company began building wooden [[freight car]]s in the early 1880s, selling a large portion of its inventory to the [[Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad|Chesapeake and Ohio]], [[Southern Pacific Railroad|Southern Pacific]] and [[Central Pacific Railroad|Central Pacific]] railroads, all of which were controlled by Huntington.&lt;ref name=MCRM /&gt; In 1962, the Huntington [[Ensign Manufacturing Company|ACF]] plant began building a revolutionary new design that quickly became the standard of the rail car industry. The car, known as the CenterFlow [[covered hopper car]], was developed by ACF to transport huge volumes of light-weight, high-bulk commodities, such as plastic pellets. By 1992, ACF had manufactured more than 100,000 hopper cars. The sprawling ACF Industries rail car plant once had many as 1,600 employees with an annual payroll of $30 million. Now, reports indicate only four people work there – and three of them are security guards.

[[File:CSXHuntingtonDivisionHeadquarters.JPG|thumb|300px|The former [[Chesapeake and Ohio Railway|C&amp;O Depot]], now [[CSX Transportation|CSX-Huntington Division Headquarters]], with the statue of [[Collis P. Huntington]] by [[Gutzon Borglum]] in the foreground.]] Since its founding as the western terminus of the C&amp;O Railroad, Huntington has served as a major break of bulk point between rail traffic and the Ohio River/[[Mississippi River]] [[Drainage basin|watershed]]. The Huntington Division is still the largest in the [[CSX Transportation]] network. A large portion of the division's revenue comes from hauling coal out of the coalfields of [[West Virginia]] and Eastern [[Kentucky]]. Much of the coal is brought to the [[Port of Huntington-Tristate]] by train to be transported by river [[barge]]s to industrial centers in other parts of the United States.

Huntington is in the company's Southern Region and is the largest of ten operating divisions on the network. The division comprises the former railroads Chesapeake and Ohio (C&amp;O); Baltimore and Ohio (B&amp;O); Western Maryland (WM); Louisville and Nashville (L&amp;N); and the Clinchfield. It serves the states of Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia and Ohio. CSX's Huntington Division main office is located in the historical former C&amp;O passenger station in downtown Huntington. The office is home to a regional office that is home to the divisions's top managers, a centralized yardmasters and train dispatchers center, a freight car light repair shop and a locomotive heavy repair facility in the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;facebook&quot; /&gt;

Huntington is also home to [[Heiner's Bakery]]. Founded in 1905, Heiner's employs nearly 500 people in its {{convert|130000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} facility. The bakery was privately owned by the Heiner family, and marketed exclusively under the &quot;Heiner's&quot; label until it was acquired by the Earthgrains division of Anheuser-Busch in 1994. Six months later, A-B spun off its bread business as the stand alone Earthgrains Corporation. In 2000, Earthgrains merged with the [[Sara Lee Corporation]]. In 2011, Sara Lee sold its bread business, including the trademark Sara Lee, to the worldwide [[Grupo Bimbo]], which is based in [[Mexico City]]. Today the bakery markets under the &quot;Heiner's&quot;, &quot;Earthgrains&quot;, &quot;Sara Lee&quot; and &quot;Bimbo&quot; brands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Heiner's Bakery|title=About Us|url=http://www.heinersbakery.com/about.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Huntington is still a base for the metal working and welding trades with the repair of rail road rolling stock, barges, and river boat equipment. Major fabricating firms—such as Huntington Special Metals,Steel of West Virginia, Martin Steel, Huntington Plating, Richwood Industries, and Hammers Industries—serve the railroads, river transportation, steel making, coal, oil, natural gas, electrical, windpower, biofuel, and other important industries.

==Culture==
Although situated in a [[Southern United States|Southern state]], Huntington was originally considered a [[American frontier|western]] city. Huntington is influenced by [[Appalachia|Appalachian Culture]], [[Culture of the Southern United States|Southern culture]], [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern culture]], and [[Mid-Atlantic states|Mid-Atlantic culture]]. It is sometimes referred to as either one of the northernmost cities in the [[Southern United States|South]], or one of the southernmost cities in the [[Union (American Civil War)|North]].

===Annual events and fairs===
Huntington is home to numerous unique events and fairs held throughout the year.

===Ritter Park===
The &quot;Crown Jewel&quot; of the city's public park system is Ritter Park (named for Charles L. Ritter, who donated the land) on land that was originally purchased as the site for an incinerator. It is a public park maintained by the Greater Huntington Park and Recreation District. It was created in 1913 by Rufus Switzer, a city council member of West Virginia.&lt;ref name=&quot;American Planning Association&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Great Places in America: Public Spaces|url=http://www.planning.org/greatplaces/spaces/2012/#WV|publisher=American Planning Association|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of numerous lengthy walking and cycling trails along Four Pole Creek, which runs the entire length of the park and is crossed by many wooden and stone [[footbridge]]s.There are also restroom facilities, picnic tables, a shelter with grills and electrical outlets, a children's playground, amphitheater that can be used for small concerts and plays, an award winning Rose Garden, and a new dog park.

[[File:FootbridgesAtRitterPark.jpg|left|thumb|300px|A few of the footbridges across Four Pole Creek below the Rose Garden and the &quot;Room with a View&quot; in Ritter Park.]] 
The park was officially opened in September 1913. Architect Gus Wofford was hired by the city to design the park and its amenities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Great Places in America: Public Spaces|url=http://www.planning.org/greatplaces/spaces/2012/#WV|publisher=Americal Planning Association (APA)|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His works continued till 1930s and includes bridges that cross streams, tennis courts, greenhouse, and picnic facilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;American Planning Association&quot;/&gt; It is located in the [[Ritter Park Historic District]], listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1990.&lt;ref name=&quot;nris&quot;&gt;{{NRISref|version=2010a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ritter Park is one of the 2012 Great Places&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Great Places|url=http://www.planning.org/greatplaces/|publisher=American Planning Association|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; of America listed by American Planning Association (APA).

Ritter Park is one of the busiest places in Huntington, but still maintaining its peaceful and serene environment.

The award winning Rose Garden and the playground are the most popular amenities of the Ritter Park that attracts tourists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Great Places in America: Public Spaces|url=http://www.planning.org/greatplaces/spaces/2012/#WV|publisher=American Planning Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; The internationally known Rose Garden, including the &quot;Room with a View&quot; is popular for weddings and special occasions.

===Paul Ambrose Trail for Health (PATH)===
[[File:AmbroseTrail.jpg|thumb|300px|The Paul Ambrose Trail for Health (PATH) going under the Fifth Avenue and [[East Huntington Bridge|Thirty-first Street]] bridges.]]
The Huntington area has wrestled with health problems for several years, problems that were made famous in 2010 by the television show Jamie Oliver’s [[Food Revolution]] on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. Before and since, concerned Huntingtonians have been working to improve the health and quality of life in the city of Huntington. One of the more popular projects has been the Paul Ambrose Trail for Health.

The Paul Ambrose Trail for Health (PATH) is a growing, bicycle and pedestrian trail system in the City of Huntington. It is designed to create interconnected loops around each of the neighborhood parks that would create recreational opportunities and an alternate means of transportation around the city. The namesake, Dr. Paul Ambrose, was a promising young physician who was killed at the Pentagon in the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. Dr. Ambrose was dedicated to family health and preventative medicine to fight obesity and the trail system is a way for his efforts to continue to have an impact in Huntington.

The Rahall Transportation Institute Foundation, in association with the City of Huntington and various community members, has designed this trail system to incorporate many of Huntington’s amenities and workplaces to allow the citizens of Huntington an alternate means of transportation. The PATH is vital in Huntington’s continued efforts towards the redevelopment and growth of the City, because it will help cut congestion, connect business and communities, and provide healthy recreational opportunities for residents.

===Memorial Park===

During Phase I, the initial park site was cleared and prepared, underground utilities were installed, a main entrance and parking lot was constructed, and the picnic shelter was installed. The shelter was unique in that it was both aesthetically pleasing and functional. Possible expansion plans include a skateboard facility, bicycle trails and tennis courts.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Sheanna. &quot;Park district to unveil improvement plan.&quot; Herald-Dispatch. 29 April 2004. 26 September  2006 [http://www.marshall.edu/cber/media/040429-HD-unveil.PDF].&lt;/ref&gt;

Camden Park is a 26 acre amusement park located near Huntington, West Virginia. It is a traditional park home to over 30 rides and attractions. The park features two of the three remaining roller coasters built by National Amusement Devices. The '''Big Dipper''', a [[wooden roller coaster]] constructed in 1958, features the original Century Flyer cars complete with headlights and detail work [http://www.coastergallery.com/2000/cam06.html]. The coaster is classified as an ACE Coaster Classic by the [[American Coaster Enthusiasts]] [http://www.rcdb.com/installationresult.htm?column=1,2,3,26,4,5&amp;order=1,2&amp;category=107]. The park's second coaster, the '''Lil' Dipper''' was completed in 1961 and is also an ACE Coaster Classic. '''The Whip''' at Camden park is an original built by Coney Island, New York's [[William F. Mangels]]. It is one of a handful of these classic flat-rides still in existence. The park is also home to several entertainment events which take place throughout the year: Children's Festival, Hot Summer Nights Concert Series, Coca-Cola Days, and Halloween Spooktacular.

Camden Park was originally built in 1903 at the western terminus of the trolley line (then owned by the [[Ohio Valley Electric Railway|Camden Interstate Railway Company]]) to encourage ridership. Camden Park is now owned by the Boylin Family. This is the second generation of Boylin’s owning and operating WV’s only amusement park. J. P. Boylin transformed Camden Park from a carousel at the end of a trolly line in Huntington, WV to an amusement park for families of all ages in 1950. By the late 19th century almost every large town in America had streetcars and many had parks to boost weekend and holiday traffic. Originally developed as a picnic area by the Camden Interstate Railway in 1903 Camden Park has survived into the 21st century as a thriving traditional amusement park. Over the years Camden Park has been the setting for baseball games, tens of thousands of picnics, fairs, marathon dances, roller derbies, flagpole sitting, a swimming pool, a zoo, plus numerous attractions and rides.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.camdenpark.com/information/ Our History].

===Beech Fork State Park===
[[File:Beech Fork State Park Lake.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Beech Fork Lake]] at [[Beech Fork State Park]].]]
[[Beech Fork State Park]] is located in [[Cabell County, West Virginia|Cabell County]] and [[Wayne County, West Virginia]], roughly 15 miles south of Downtown Huntington. The park is located on the tailwater shores of [[Beech Fork Lake]], a flood control impoundment of the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] on the Beech Fork of [[Twelvepole Creek]]. Since its development in the mid 1970s, Beech Fork State Park has proven to be a popular recreation spot for the residents of nearby [[Barboursville, West Virginia|Barboursville]] and Huntington, West Virginia, as well as those living in the surrounding region. The park is located about {{convert|10|mi|km}} south of the [[Hal Greer]] Exit (Exit 11) of [[Interstate 64]]. Access to the park is also available from Exits 8, 15, and 20 of [[I-64]]. The [[Beech Fork Lake]] Dam and Marina are about a 20 mile (40 minute) drive from the park.

[[Beech Fork State Park]] is home to [[Beech Fork Lake]], which is a &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;{{convert|720|acre|adj=on}}&lt;/span&gt; [[reservoir]] located near [[Lavalette, West Virginia|Lavalette]] in [[Wayne County, West Virginia|Wayne County]], [[West Virginia]]. Beech Fork Lake is also partly located in neighboring [[Cabell County, West Virginia|Cabell County]]. Millers Fork and Stowers Branch join Beech Fork with their own river valleys contributing to the majority of the lakesurface of Beech Fork Lake. These streams are [[tributary|tributaries]] of [[Twelvepole Creek]].

Beech Fork Lake as a flood control impoundment was authorized by the [[Flood Control Act]] of October 23, 1962 and was constructed by the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] in the mid-1970s. The lake was completed and dedicated in May 1978.

Known in agrarian times as &quot;Bean Capital Of The World&quot; because of its abundant harvests, remote Beech Fork and its fertile farms had by the mid-20th century devolved into a [http://www.thefreedictionary.com/tobacco+road &quot;Tobacco Road&quot;] cut off from the opportunities of modern development. Some tombstones in the Park's Bowen Cemetery date to the 18th century; and family names adorning Civil War graves can be seen on roadside mailboxes even today. Government appropriation of private land for the lake caused rancor among locals with historic land holdings. The Beech Fork strain of [[Adkins]] family (appropriately known as &quot;Beech Fork Adkinses&quot;) was largely driven out to the [[Huntington, West Virginia metropolitan area|Huntington metropolitan area]]. So numerous were these displaced persons that townsfolk joked about an &quot;Adkins factory&quot; at Beech Fork which mass-produced persons of the surname. It has also been said that in the last days, &quot;the Jews will go back to Palestine and the Adkinses will go back to Beech Fork.&quot;

Huntington's sports scene is dominated by Marshall University athletics and [[Huntington Prep School|Huntington Prep basketball]].

===The Thundering Herd===
Marshall's sports teams are known as the ''Thundering Herd''. The school colors are kelly green and white. Marshall participates in [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] ([[Division I (NCAA)#Division I-A|FBS]] for [[American football|football]]) as a member of [[Conference USA]]. The name Thundering Herd came from a [[Zane Gray]] novel released in 1925, and a silent movie of the same two years later. Marshall teams were originally known as the Indians, and the green-white colors came in 1903, replacing black and blue. [[The Herald-Dispatch]] sports editor Carl &quot;Duke&quot; Ridgley tagged the team with the Thundering Herd name, but many other nicknames were suggested over the next thirty years, including Boogercats, Big Green, Green Gobblers, Rams, Judges and others. In 1965, students, alums and faculty settled on Thundering Herd in a vote, and Big Green was given to the athletic department's fund-raising wing.

Sports at the school include women's [[softball]], [[swimming (sport)|swimming]] &amp; [[diving]], [[tennis]], [[volleyball]], and [[track &amp; field]]; men's [[American football|football]], [[baseball]]; and teams for both genders in [[basketball]] [[cross country running|cross country]], [[golf]], and [[soccer]].&lt;ref name=&quot;herdzone&quot; /&gt; Marshall also fields club teams, not affiliated with the MU Athletic Department, in [[rugby union]] for both women and men, men's and women's [[lacrosse]], and an equestrian team that competes in the [[Intercollegiate Horse Show Association]].

Huntington Prep is housed within [[St. Joseph Central Catholic High School]], a religious school.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herald&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.herald-dispatch.com/sports/x455055355/Coach-explains-Huntington-Prep|title=Coach explains Huntington Prep|work=[[The Herald-Dispatch]]|date=18 Jan 2013|author=Grant Traylor}}&lt;/ref&gt; The students are regular St. Joseph's students and must abide to the rules and regulations of the high school.&lt;ref name=&quot;WAPost&quot; /&gt; Practice is held in the Recreation Center at [[Marshall University]],&lt;ref name=&quot;WAPost&quot; /&gt; with &quot;home&quot; games played at local high schools, the [[Cam Henderson Center]], and formerly at the now demolished [[Veterans Memorial Fieldhouse]].

The team's nickname is the &quot;Express&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;WAPost&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2012-02-22/sports/35442168_1_school-basketball-teams-basketball-academy-high-school|title=Huntington Prep’s after-school special: Basketball players attend classes at St. Joseph’s Central Catholic, then play for the Express|work=[[The Washington Post]]|author=Josh Barr|date=22 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a derivative of the nickname of the [[Old Huntington High School|former Huntington High School]], &quot;Pony Express&quot;, and the city's [[railroad]] heritage. (The current Huntington High is a consolidation of the original Huntington High and Huntington East High School, and took East's nickname of &quot;Highlanders&quot;.) The school colors are Carolina blue and yellow. None of the players are from West Virginia, as Coach Rob Fulford does not want to take West Virginia players away from their local teams. Instead, all the players are recruited and attend St. Joseph's.&lt;ref name=&quot;WVSSAC&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MetroNews&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wvmetronews.com/huntington-prep-coach-building-national-program|title=Huntington Prep coach building national program|author=Garrett Cullen|work=[[West_Virginia_Radio_Corporation#West_Virginia_Metro_News|West Virginia Metro News]]|date=28 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, the school is excluded from playing West Virginia teams by the [[West Virginia Secondary School Activities Commission]], which is the state's high school sanctioning body.

Some of the former players playing in college currently are [[Gorgui Dieng]] (University of Louisville), Justin Coleman (Louisville/Marshall University), Maurice Aniefiok (Ole Miss), Sim Bhuller (New Mexico State), Jeramiah Davis (University of Cincinnati), Aleksandar Kesic (Iona University), Charles Lee (Cleveland State), Ibrahima Djimde (Illinois), Negus Webster-Chan (Missouri), Stefan Jankovic (Missouri), Elijah Macon (West Virginia), JaVontae Hawkins (South Florida), along with more to come every year. Players on this years team hail from Canada, the U.S., Nigeria, and Russia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herald&quot; /&gt; The team is coached by West Virginia natives Rob Fulford (Mullens HS), Arkell Bruce (Huntington HS), Baker Neal (Parkersburg South HS), Ryan Arrowood (Hannan HS), and David Meddings (Wayne HS).&lt;ref name=&quot;Herald&quot; /&gt;

==Transportation==
===Interstates and highways===
The [[Roads of Huntington, West Virginia]] currently include one major interstate [[Interstate 64]], two U.S. highways; [[U.S. Route 60]] and [[U.S. Route 52]], 6 state routes, and numerous major thoroughfares. Huntington utilizes a grid-like street pattern featuring several wide [[boulevard|boulevard-style]] avenues that run east and west. Most notable of these are Third and Fifth Avenues. The city has a numbered street naming system, with avenues running east and west (parallel to the Ohio River) and streets running north and south. The city is divided into an &quot;East End&quot; and a &quot;West End&quot; by First Street. Streets west of First Street carry as &quot;West&quot; indicator after the street name (i.e. &quot;Fourteenth Street West&quot;). The street plan was originally laid out by [[Andrew J. Enslow]], who was a professional contractor, making Huntington one of the first professionally-planned cities in America.

[[File:I-64.svg|25px]] [[Interstate 64 in West Virginia|Interstate 64]], which skirts the South Hills of Huntington with four interchanges that serve the city: [[U.S. Route 52 in West Virginia#West Huntington Expressway|US 52 (West Huntington Expressway)]], [[West Virginia Route 152|WV 152]]/[[West Virginia Route 527|WV 527]], [[West Virginia Route 10|WV 10]], and [[U.S. Route 60|US 60]]. Exits 6 through 15 service the City of Huntington. '''Exit 6: ''' [[U.S. Route 52 in West Virginia|US 52]] is located at exit 6. Heading north on the four-lane expressway leads to West Huntington and across the [[West Huntington Bridge]] into [[Ohio]]. Heading south overlaps the interstate west towards Kenova, where US 52 exits and heads south paralleling with the [[Big Sandy River (Ohio River)|Big Sandy River]]. This is at exit 1. '''Exit 8: ''' Similar to exit 11, [[West Virginia Route 527|WV 527]]'s southern terminus lies at the north side of I-64. [[West Virginia Route 152|WV 152]] makes its northern terminus on the south side of the interstate. The two highways are the renumbered U.S. 52 that moved to a new route in 1979 south of Kenova. Both routes literally terminate into each other at exit 8. '''Exit 11: ''' [[West Virginia Route 10|Hal Greer Boulevard (WV 10)]], north of I-64. South of I-64 the highway is known is [[West Virginia Route 10|16th Street Road (WV 10)]]. The quickest way to [[Marshall University]] is at exit 11. '''Exit 15: ''' [[U.S. Route 60|US 60]] near [[West Pea Ridge, West Viginia|West Pea Ridge]]. US 60 west heads toward downtown.

[[File:I-73.svg|25px]][[File:I-74.svg|25px]] [[Interstate 73]] and [[Interstate 74]] are programmed to run concurrent with [[U.S. Route 52 in West Virginia|US 52]] throughout western West Virginia. It is slated to use the [[Tulsia Highway]] near Kenova and the [[West Huntington Expressway]] near West Huntington's Old Central City neighborhood.

[[File:US 60.svg|25px]] [[U.S. Route 60]] is part of the historic [[Midland Trail (West Virginia)|Midland Trail]] enters the city coming from Barboursville in the east at exit 11 off [[Interstate 64]]. U.S. 60 heads toward downtown, splitting into the 3rd and 5th avenues, just west of the WV 2 terminus. U.S. Route 60 parallels the [[Ohio River]] through downtown, and merges into a four-lane undivided highway after crossing under the West Huntington Expressway (U.S. Route 52) in the West End. U.S. 60 exits the city in the west near the [[Camden Park (amusement park)|Camden Park]].

[[File:US 52.svg|25px]] [[U.S. Route 52 in West Virginia|U.S. Route 52 (West Huntington Expressway)]] is a four lane expressway that enters Huntington from [[Ohio]] via the [[West Huntington Bridge]] from [[Chesapeake, Ohio]] in the north, and heads south crossing U.S. 60 in the West End. U.S. 52 then turns west, overlapping Interstate 64 beginning at exit 6, just south of Huntington city limits. U.S. 52 and I-64 stay concurrent for 5 miles in an easterly direction until reaching Exit 1, signed as the Kenova-Ceredo exit. Along with [[West Virginia Route 75]], U.S. 52 heads south from the intersection, paralleling the [[Big Sandy River (Ohio River)|Big Sandy River]] and [[U.S. 23]], which parallels the river on the [[Kentucky]] side of the river. From one mile south of Kenova, it is known as the Tolsia Highway for many miles through Wayne County.

[[File:WV-2.svg|25px]] [[West Virginia Route 2]] makes its southern terminus just north of Huntington at U.S. Route 60. [[West Virginia Route 2|WV 2]], which parallels the entirety of West Virginia's section of the [[Ohio River]], and facilitates much traffic towards [[Point Pleasant, West Virginia|Point Pleasant]] and [[Parkersburg, West Virginia|Parkersburg]].

[[File:WV-10.svg|25px]] [[West Virginia Route 10]] follows the Guyandotte River for much of its length and connects Huntington to [[Princeton, West Virginia|Princeton]]. It enters the city south of [[Interstate 64 in West Virginia|Interstate 64]] at [[Hal Greer|Hal Greer Boulevard]]. North of I-64 the highway is known as  16th Street . The highway's northern terminus is in downtown just south of the [[Ohio River]] at U.S. Route 60, near [[Marshall University]].

[[File:WV-101.svg|25px]] [[West Virginia Route 101]]
'''WV 101''' is an unsigned highway which runs for less than a mile, connecting [[U.S. Route 60|Third Avenue (US 60)]] with [[Rotary Park]]. Until 1990, this was an alignment of US 60.

[[File:WV-106.svg|25px]] [[West Virginia Route 106]]
'''WV 106''' enters the Huntington neighborhood of [[Guyandotte, Huntington, West Virginia|Guyandotte]], via the  [[East End Bridge (Huntington)|East End Bridge]] from [[Proctorville, Ohio|Proctorville]]. The highway crosses WV Route 2, and immediately terminates at U.S. Route 60, across the 3rd and 5th avenue split.

[[File:WV-152.svg|25px]] [[West Virginia Route 152]]
'''WV 152''''s northern terminus is just shy of the city at [[Interstate 64 in West Virginia|Interstate 64]]. Continuing north changes to WV 527.

[[File:WV-527.svg|25px]] [[West Virginia Route 527]]
'''WV 527''' crosses south into Huntington from [[Chesapeake, Ohio]], via the [[Robert C. Byrd Bridge]]. WV 527 then travels through downtown as 5th Street and exits the city at Interstate 64, which serves as the highway's southern terminus. Continuing south will lead into WV 152.

===Bridges===
{{See also|Pink Bridge}}

The city has connections over the [[Ohio River]] to [[Proctorville, Ohio]] via the [[East Huntington Bridge|Gatski Memorial Bridge]], and to [[Chesapeake, Ohio]] via the [[Robert C. Byrd Bridge]] and the [[West Huntington Bridge]].

{{wide image|RCByrdBridge-Huntington-WV.jpg|550px|The [[Robert C. Byrd Bridge]] crossing the [[Ohio River]] at Sixth Street}}
The [[Robert C. Byrd Bridge]] is a {{convert|720|ft|adj=on}} [[continuous truss bridge|continuous truss]] automobile bridge that crosses the [[Ohio River]] between Huntington, West Virginia and [[Chesapeake, Ohio]]. The crossing was constructed to replace an old, narrow two lane structure that was demolished after 69 years of service in a spectacular implosion on July 17, 1995. The previous bridge, opened in 1926, was Huntington's first bridge across the Ohio River and was designed in a gothic style, complete with four two-ton spires that rested on top of each peak. The ground breaking ceremonies for the four-lane bridge was held on April 30, 1991.

The old 6th Street Bridge closed in the summer of 1993 to allow for the construction of the ramps and approaches in West Virginia and Ohio.&lt;ref name=&quot;BOSM&quot;&gt;&quot;Bridge opening sparks memories.&quot; The Ironton Tribune. 6 Nov. 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; The new bridge was named the Robert C. Byrd Bridge under an executive order from former Governor [[Gaston Caperton]] to honor the U.S. senator from [[West Virginia]] who is credited with obtaining the funding for the project that was completed on November 6, 1994. The $32.6 million bridge was constructed with $1.4 coming from [[Ohio]], $5.6 coming from West Virginia, and $25.3 in federal funds. The famous spires, which once adorned the top of the former span, were saved. One is currently on display outside of the [[Chesapeake, Ohio|Chesapeake]] city hall at the intersection of [[State Route 7 (Ohio)|State Route 7]] and the Robert C. Byrd Bridge.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Bridge's old spire getting a new lease.&quot; Herald Dispatch. 29 Oct. 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Two others are installed along 9th Street between 3rd and 5th Avenues.&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, Bryan. &quot;Plaza to reopen in December.&quot; 26 Nov. 2006 Herald-Dispatch [Huntington]. 27 27 Nov. 2006 [http://www.heralddispatch.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061126/NEWS01/611260318/1001/NEWS10].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:East End Bridge at Night.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The [[East Huntington Bridge|Gaski Memorial Bridge]] at night, as seen from Bradrick, OH in 2007.]]
The [[East Huntington Bridge]] (officially the &quot;Frank Gatski Memorial Bridge,&quot; also called the &quot;East End Bridge&quot; or the &quot;31st Street Bridge&quot;) is a {{convert|900|ft|adj=on}} [[cable-stayed bridge]] crossing the [[Ohio River]] at Huntington, West Virginia. It carries [[West Virginia Route 106|WV 106]] on the [[West Virginia]] approach and [[Ohio State Route 775|OH 775]] on the [[Ohio]] approach. The history of the span dates to the early 1970s when possible routings for a future [[Ohio River]] span were being discussed. To conform to the Huntington city comprehensive plan, the alignment preferred by the city was one that connected to [[Interstate 64]] outside of the city boundaries. Many favored a plan about one mile north of the city along [[West Virginia Route 2|WV 2]].

Work began on the bridge in 1983 and was completed in August 1985 at a cost of $38 million. The designer of the bridge was Arvid Grant and Associated of [[Olympia, Washington]] and was the first bridge of its type in [[West Virginia]]. It was only the second of its kind in the United States since it utilized concrete instead of steel for its construction. It was built as a [[Federal Highway Administration|FHWA]] demonstration project. The [[Ohio River]] span and approach ramps on both sides of the river completed was what was known as Phase I. Future plans involved tolling the bridge and connecting it to [[U.S. Route 60|U.S. Highway 60]] four blocks east&lt;ref&gt;East Huntington Bridge. Rendering. 1971. West Virginia Department of Highways.&lt;/ref&gt; The bridge was renamed for Marshall University's first member of the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]], [[Frank Gatski|Frank &quot;Gunner&quot; Gatski]], during halftime of the Marshall-UTEP Football game on November 18, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Frank ‘Gunner’ Gatski Memorial Bridge to be dedicated at UTEP-Marshall game.&quot; 17 Nov. 2006.

{{See also|Huntington (Amtrak station)}}
[[File:CSXHuntingtonDivisionHeadquarters.JPG|thumb|300px|The former [[Chesapeake and Ohio Railway|C&amp;O]] Depot, now [[CSX Transportation|CSX]]-Huntington Division Headquarters, with the statue of [[Collis P. Huntington]] by [[Gutzon Borglum]] in the foreground.]] Since its founding as the western terminus of the C&amp;O Railroad, Huntington has served as a major break of bulk point between rail traffic and the Ohio River/[[Mississippi River]] [[Drainage basin|watershed]]. The Huntington Division is still the largest in the [[CSX Transportation]] network. A large portion of the division's revenue comes from hauling coal out of the coalfields of [[West Virginia]] and Eastern [[Kentucky]]. Much of the coal is brought to the [[Port of Huntington-Tristate]] by train to be transported by river [[barge]]s to industrial centers in other parts of the United States.

Huntington is in the company's Southern Region and is the largest of ten operating divisions on the network. The division comprises the former railroads Chesapeake and Ohio (C&amp;O); Baltimore and Ohio (B&amp;O); Western Maryland (WM); Louisville and Nashville (L&amp;N); and the Clinchfield. It serves the states of Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia and Ohio. CSX's Huntington Division main office is located in the historical former C&amp;O passenger station in downtown Huntington. The office is home to a regional office that is home to the divisions's top managers, a centralized yardmasters and train dispatchers center, a freight car light repair shop and a locomotive heavy repair facility in the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;facebook&quot; /&gt;

[[File:AmtrakHton.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The platform area of the Huntington Amtrak station as seen from the tracks.]]
The city was once a major hub for passenger rail service in the country, but it now accounts for a significantly smaller portion of rail traffic than in the early decades of the 20th century. Huntington, however, has an [[Amtrak]] station that lies on the [[Cardinal (train)|Cardinal]] line running between New York City and Chicago via [[Washington, D.C.]] and [[Cincinnati]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cardinal/Hoosier State|author=[[Amtrak]]|url=http://www.amtrak.com/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=Amtrak/am2Route/Horizontal_Route_Page&amp;c=am2Route&amp;cid=1081256321680&amp;ssid=134|accessdate=June 17, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The station is located at 1050 8th Avenue, the station consists of a platform on the south side of the east-west tracks, a small parking lot, and a small building in between. The station contains a waiting room and ticket office. Huntington is served by the ''[[Cardinal (train)|Cardinal]]'' route.

The Huntington station is located six blocks south and two blocks west of the [[Tri-State Transit Authority]] Transit Center. Most TTA bus routes and the Greyhound Bus stop at that station. For closer connections, riders can take advantage of TTA Routes 2, 4, 5, 6, 10, which pass two blocks of the station at 4th Avenue. Those connectionss are not always practical under current ''Cardinal'' schedule. The passengers who arrive on the eastbound train from Chicago can easily transfer to any route that serves the Transit Center, most bus routes don't start running until the train departs. Except for the few PM routes, most TTA routes stop running hours before the westbound train arrives, limiting options for any passengers who are either boarding or disembarking from the train.

===Public transit===
[[File:Huntington Trolley.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Trolley bus No. 9 on Fourth Avenue]]
[[Tri-State Transit Authority]] (TTA) provides fixed-route bus service throughout Huntington and the surrounding area. Its buses range, on the [[West Virginia]] side from 19th Street West in Huntington to [[Milton, West Virginia]], about 20 miles to the east. On the [[Ohio]] side, the buses range from downtown Ironton to the Huntington suburb of [[Proctorville, Ohio]], which is also a range of about 20 miles. Interchange buses provide links between Huntington and [[Chesapeake, Ohio]], and between Ironton and [[Ashland, Kentucky]], where transfers are available to the [[Ashland Bus System]]. However the system does not interchange between the TTA and the City of Ashland Bus Service in [[Ceredo, West Virginia]].

The TTA also is involved in a [[joint venture]] with the [[Charleston, West Virginia]]-based [[Kanawha Valley Regional Transportation Authority]] bus system called [[Intelligent Transit]] which links downtown Huntington to Charleston via bus. All buses begin and end at the old [[Greyhound Bus]] Depot in downtown Huntington, which is now known as the TTA Center. Coordinates: {{tld|coord|38|25|18|N|82|26|14|W|display=inline,title}} TTA bus services&lt;ref name=routes&gt;[http://www.tta-wv.com/routes_schedules.html TTA routes and schedules]&lt;/ref&gt; operate on Monday to Saturday between 6:00 a.m. and 11:15 p.m.

===River===
[[File:OhioRiverHuntWVBCBB.jpg|left|thumb|300px|The Ohio River looking upstream from the Robert C. Byrd Bridge]]
The [[Port of Huntington-Tristate]] is the largest inland port in the United States in both in terms of total tonnage and ton-miles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top twenty inland ports for 2003|author=Waterborne Commerce Statistics Center|url=http://www.iwr.usace.army.mil/ndc/wcsc/pdf/inlandport03f.pdf|accessdate=June 17, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due in large part to the coal traffic from the railroads and the [[petroleum]] products produced by the [[Marathon Petroleum Company]] [[oil refinery]] in nearby [[Catlettsburg, Kentucky]] that use the Port of Huntington/Tri-State to load their products onto barges.

===Air===
[[Tri-State Airport]], located southwest of the city, is a public airport with two runways. Commercial air service is provided by three airlines: [[Allegiant Air]], [[Delta Connection]], and [[US Airways Express]].

==History==
The history of Bluefield begins in the 18th century, when two families settled in a rugged and remote part of what is now southern West Virginia, and built a small village with a mill, a church, a one-room schoolhouse, and a fort for defending the small settlement against invasions by the much larger [[Shawnee]] Indian tribe on the banks of the [[Bluestone River]]. The Davidson and Bailey family had to sell a portion of their land when in 1882, Captain John Fields, of the [[Norfolk and Western Railway]] pioneered the area and began building a new railroad through the hills of Bluefield.  The city is traditionally thought to be named after the [[chicory]] flowers in the area that colored the landscape a purplish blue hue during the summer.  However, research has indicated that this settlement which was also known as Higginbotham's Summit in the 1880s was probably named for the coal fields of the Bluestone River.

===Coal rush===
Beneath the land of the Davidsons and Baileys lay the largest and richest deposit of [[bituminous coal]] in the world - the soft burning coal which was ripe for fueling the industrial machines of the developing world. The first seam was discovered in nearby [[Pocahontas, Virginia]] in the backyard of Jordan Nelson which was, in the words of President [[Frederick J. Kimball|Frederick Kimball]] of the Norfolk and Western Company, the &quot;most spectacular find on the continent and indeed perhaps of the entire planet.&quot; The seam is also mentioned in [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s &quot;[[Notes on the State of Virginia]]&quot;, but it was not mined until 1890.

Around that time, the coal mines that soon opened up in the area—around Harman, Bluefield, War, and Pocahontas—were known as the Pocahontas Coal Fields; they helped drive the [[Industrial Revolution]] in the United States and fuel the American and British navies during both World Wars. The herculean effort to extract the coal from the mountains created a vast boom in the local and national economy, bringing emigrant European workers to the mountains in search of work.

In the one-year period from 1887 to 1888, passenger travel along the railroad increased 317%. Like the extremely accelerated growth [[San Francisco]] experienced during the [[gold rush]], Bluefield became a city that sprang up &quot;overnight,&quot; and it far outpaced the infrastructure available to it at the time. [[Urban sprawl]] and [[Urban decay|blight]] were common complaints in the early days.

Bluefield was not a city that controlled its own destiny. Indeed, the growth and decay of the city depended almost entirely upon Norfolk and Western Railroad—which in turn regarded the whims of the international market as a higher priority than the longevity and prosperity of Bluefield. When coal tonnage was good and the market for coal was booming, Bluefield was essentially a &quot;Little New York,&quot; as it was called in the day. A bustling metropolis, it had a nightlife and a personality that was &quot;a little bit Chicago, a little bit New York, and a whole lot of Pittsburgh&quot;{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}—rugged and with steel and coal embedded in its soul.

The coal boom fueled a flood of money into the area, and nearby [[Bramwell, West Virginia|Bramwell]], incorporated in 1888, boasted itself as the &quot;Millionaires' Town&quot; because more millionaires per capita lived there than anywhere in the nation. The city also had more automobiles per capita than any other city in the country at the time which meant that, in the early days, Bluefield experienced the &quot;five o'clock traffic jam/gridlock&quot; long before the majority of the rest of the nation—even before [[New York City]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Also called &quot;Summit City&quot; because of its high elevation and its naturally sloping divides in the coal yards, Bluefield became one of the first cities in the world to have a noticeable skyline - with highrises that were comparable to New York and Chicago in their day. Today, although many of those highrises remain, they are no longer similar to the many famous skylines in many modern American cities.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Primarily due to the introduction and globalization of other fuel sources, today's Bluefield does not resemble the Bluefield of long past. Bluefield is now a much quieter town compared to the boom between 1890 and 1960. Many rundown remnants of once-grand mansions and office buildings still remain in the north side of town near the railroad tracks.

In 1889, the city of Bluefield was officially incorporated. The city government was always known in those days as being corrupt, inefficient, with drunken brawls and fights breaking out on the floor of City Hall on an almost daily basis.

With a strong ethnic community, Bluefield was the site of the 1895 founding of the Bluefield Colored Institute, the nation's first [[historically black colleges and universities|college with primarily black students]]. That college is today's [[Bluefield State College]], and the site of a November 21, 1968 terrorist bombing.

===20th century===
During the 1920s, the most impressive high-rise in Bluefield history was built, the twelve-story opulent West Virginian Hotel, now the West Virginia Manor and Retirement Home. In 1924, nearby Graham, Virginia decided to rename itself [[Bluefield, Virginia]] to try to unite the two towns, who had been feuding since the civil war. Nobel-prize-winning economist and mathematician [[John Forbes Nash]] was born in Bluefield in 1928.

The [[Great Depression]] however, broke the city's back. With the government nearly bankrupt, and series of devastating structural fires that swept through the downtown area and nearly took down every high rise the city had so feverishly built, the city was nearly destroyed. It was not until World War II came that the coal fires started burning again.

The importance of the city was so great that [[Adolf Hitler]] even put Bluefield on his reputed list of German air raid targets in the United States. Air raid practice drills were common in the city during this time.

The [[Interstate Highway System]] finally punched through [[East River Mountain Tunnel|East River Mountain]] in the 1960s, and for the first time automobile traffic could pass through the city without crossing the top of the mountain. The dependence on railroad traffic waned and the city began to shrink in population and eventually lost its [[Amtrak]] station in the 1980s.

[[Thomas Edd Mayfield]], one of the Mayfield Brothers [[Bluegrass music|Bluegrass]] [[musician]]s of [[West Texas]], died of [[leukemia]] in a Bluefield [[hospital]] in 1958 at the age of thirty-two while he was on tour with [[Bill Monroe]] and the Bluegrass Boys.

==Culture==
Bluefield prides itself on its hospitable climate. Since 1938 the Chamber of Commerce has given free [[lemonade]] when the temperature has surpassed 90°F.&lt;ref&gt;http://cityofbluefield.com//index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=178&amp;Itemid=272&lt;/ref&gt; The city's motto is &quot;nature's air conditioned city, where the summer spends the winter.&quot;

Jazz musician [[Louis Jordan]]'s song &quot;Salt Pork, W.Va.&quot; was inspired by his time in a Bluefield jail.

A controversy exists over whether or not [[Hank Williams]] was last seen alive in Bluefield on his way to a show in Ohio. He was discovered dead in [[Oak Hill, West Virginia]].

==Sports==
Bluefield was the home of the [[Appalachian League]] (rookie) [[Bluefield Blue Jays|Bluefield Orioles]] baseball team until 2010.  The Orioles have had a team in Bluefield since 1958, which was the longest relationship between a parent club and a town in affiliated baseball.&lt;ref name=&quot;bdt28Aug2010&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title=Orioles leaving Bluefield|url=http://bdtonline.com/local/x329608842/AFTERNOON-UPDATE-Orioles-leaving-Bluefield|accessdate=29 August 2010|newspaper=Bluefield Daily Telegraph|date=28 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bsunblog&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Orioles out of Bluefield|url=http://weblogs.baltimoresun.com/sports/orioles/blog/2010/08/orioles_out_of_bluefield.html|work=Orioles Insider: Baltimore Sun|accessdate=29 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Toronto Blue Jays replaced Baltimore for the 2011 season with the [[Bluefield Blue Jays]]. The team plays at [[Bowen Field]] (former Orioles stadium) and several renovations have been made to the ball park.

Bluefield High School has 22 state championships in all sports, which is more than any other AA school in the state. Bluefield ranks third in total football state championships with ten. They trail now closed Ceredo-Kenova High School (12) and national powerhouse [[Parkersburg High School]] (11).

Bluefield is largely a football town and the rivalry between the Bluefield Beavers and their sister city [[Bluefield, Virginia]]'s Graham G-Men always draws a large crowd at [[Mitchell Stadium]]. 2005 saw the introduction of the Bluefield Barons, an Alliance Football League team.

Bluefield is also home to the East River Soccer Complex which has five fields and hosts local high school and [[college soccer]] games.
