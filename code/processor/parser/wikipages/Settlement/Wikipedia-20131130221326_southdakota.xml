== History ==
Armour was founded in 1885. The city was named for [[Philip D. Armour]], who was founder of [[Armour and Company]], a meat packing company.

The athletic teams of [[Armour High School]] were formerly known as the &quot;Packers&quot; in reference to the well known packing company, although today the high school plays its sports jointly with Tripp-Delmont High School as the &quot;Tripp-Delmont/Armour Nighthawks.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =Tripp Delmont Armour Nighthawks | work = | publisher = | date = | url =http://www.armour.k12.sd.us/SPORTS/2007_2008%20Sports/2007_2008_sports.htm | accessdate =2008-02-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Canton''' is a city in and the [[county seat]] of [[Lincoln County, South Dakota|Lincoln County]], [[South Dakota]], [[United States]]. Canton is located 20 minutes south of [[Sioux Falls, South Dakota|Sioux Falls]] in southeastern South Dakota. Canton is nestled in the rolling hills of the Sioux Valley, providing an abundance of recreational activities with the [[Big Sioux River]] bordering the eastern side, [[Newton Hills State Park]] to the south, and [[Lake Alvin]] to the north. The city was named by Norwegian settler and former legislator [[James M. Wahl]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.augie.edu/cws/Norwegian-American%20guide%202006-07.pdf Microsoft Word - Norwegian-American guide 2006-07&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://legis.state.sd.us/historical/Index.aspx?FuseAction=Detail&amp;MemberID=3424 South Dakota Historical Listing Legislator Detail James M. Wahl&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The population was 3,057 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].

==History==
The earliest known visitor to the area was Lewis P. Hyde, who first came to the area in 1866. The first actual settler was August Linderman. By 1868, there were 35 people living in Lincoln County. The residents named the community Canton, believing the location to be the exact opposite of [[Guangzhou|Canton, China]]. By the summer of that year, a caravan of 180 Norwegian settlers crossed the Big Sioux River to make their home in Canton. In 1880, the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad crossed the Big Sioux River to reach Canton. The city still has an active rail freight service. The city has many historical homes and buildings dating back to the late 1800s. Some notable sites include The Kennedy Mansion on Dakota Street, as well as the Historical Society House built in 1886. Lincoln County Courthouse was built in 1889, and Canton Lutheran Church was built in 1908.

==Economic Development==

===Early Development===
The Big Sioux River has been an important part of the development of Canton. A ship builder named M. M. Hanson from Milwaukee, Wisconsin came to Canton in 1892.  The site of the Big Sioux inspired &quot;Cap&quot; Hanson to build &quot;The City of Canton&quot;.  The forty-foot steam launch had a speed of fifteen to eighteen miles per hour and could carry 100 passengers.  This became the beginning of a thriving business for &quot;Cap&quot;.  Pleasure seekers could go up and down the river stopping at the various parks along the banks. In 1901, &quot;Cap&quot; built his second boat, the &quot;Sioux Queen&quot;.  This gasoline powered boat could carry 200 passengers.  He also had a fleet of thirty row boats for hire. Many family-owned canoes were often seen on the river as well as other launches. A spring flood in 1906 washed out the Beloit Dam. The dam was rebuilt, but the dam was washed out again three years later. This ended the &quot;Sioux Queen's&quot; travels, and destroyed &quot;Caps&quot; boat business.

===South Dakota Certified Ready Site===
The Canton Industrial Park was approved as the first South Dakota Certified Ready Site, in 2012. Located on the west side of Canton along U.S. Highway 18, the Canton Industrial Park covers nearly 28 acres and is certified and zoned heavy industrial, light industrial, research and development/business services and rural business park. The park already houses Adam’s Thermal and Terex.
 
The South Dakota Certified Ready Sites Program is an economic development tool available to all cities and counties in South Dakota to promote development-ready commercial and industrial sites.
 
The South Dakota Certified Ready Sites Program is operated under the supervision of the Governor’s Office of Economic Development (GOED) for the purpose of providing consistent information on sites available throughout the state.

===Business &amp; Industry===
Canton is home to six industries. The longest active company has been the Eastern Farmers Co-op built in 1860, and employs approximately 54 people. Adams Thermal Systems, a company of approximately 1,100 employees, manufactures oil coolers, radiators and other engine cooling systems and components primarily for use in off-highway vehicles such as agricultural and construction equipment. Another employer is Bid-Well, a Terex Company.  Bid-Well specializes in concrete paving equipment. This business, founded in Canton, employs 49 people.  Johnson Feed, Inc. distributes a wide range of salt products, as well as baler twine, tires, dog food and other items. They employ approximately 350 people and have over 250 trucks going to 48 states.  Fastek Products and its division, Midwest Molding is owned and operated in Canton. This company employs about 100 people. Fastek specialize in die cast items, plastic injection molding, and parts for the window industry.  Legacy Electronics building memory modules, circuit boards and other computer components.  They employ approximately 75 people.

==Augustana College==
{{main|Augustana College (South Dakota)}}

In 1884, [[Augustana College (South Dakota)|Augustana College]] moved from Beloit, IA to Canton.  An elementary through high school was also built as part of Augustana's relocation,and educated the internationally known physicist [[Merle Tuve]], and brothers [[John H. Lawrence|John Lawrence]] and [[E. O. Lawrence|Ernest Lawrence]]. 

Augustana struggled in Canton until Anthony G. Tuve became president in 1890. Attendance doubled, but a series of crop failures soon followed. As a result, in 1894, the Church Synod withheld appropriations. President Tuve assumed all financial obligations in order to keep the school open. After the crisis, Augustana prospered and soon outgrew its building. The building was moved in 1901.  Then, in 1902, the college added to the campus on the east side of town. A four and ½ story brick building was erected to house classrooms, a gymnasium, and chapel.  The new structure was dedicated in 1903.  The college continued to grow. Enrollment increased to 330 by 1918. The school became widely known for its excellence in academics and for the many scholars came for speaking engagements.  

The United Norwegian Lutheran Synod had its headquarters on campus. An event in 1917 took place that changed the college and community. That year, the Norwegian Lutheran Synods merged to become the Norwegian Lutheran Church of America. The new synod considered it inadvisable to maintain Augustana College and Lutheran Normal School in Sioux Falls, barely 25 miles apart. A vigorous campaign to keep the college in Canton began. But, the advantages of locating the school in a larger community prevailed, and Canton lost their college. The bitterness was great, and was intensified when President Tuve died suddenly.  The area pastors in the South Dakota district realized something needed to be done.  An agreement was proposed and accepted that Canton would put up an endowment of $200,000 and turn it over to Augustana College. Then, the Normal School division would move to Canton.  A fund drive was successful and the Canton Lutheran Normal School opened in the fall of 1920. The gradual transfer of the Academy division to the Canton campus was made between 1920 and 1932. The school was known as Augustana Academy in 1932 and was no longer a division of the college. Capital improvements were made to the campus through the next several years including a new gymnasium and dormitory. 

The history of Augustana Academy came to an end in 1971. The campus was closed and was sold to Keystone Treatment Center. The “Old Main” building has been converted into apartments.

==National Ski Tournament Site &amp; Sioux Valley Ski Club==
A young man by the named Ludwig Holter from Norway, gave a skiing exhibition to a group of Canton Students in 1911. This exhibition began the quest to clear the hill and build a scaffold and jump in 1912. From that platform at the peak of the hill to a landing place was drop of 275 feet.  Skiers could cover a distance of one eighth of a mile at up to 100 miles per hour. Soon tournaments were held at about two-year intervals. On February 11 and 12, 1925, a National Tournament was held and Canton hosted over 5,000 fans. The Sioux Valley Ski Club was organized that year. World renowned singer, Eric Bye, gave the trophy to the Sioux Valley Club. Many notables were present that day including a member of the Olympic team, national champions, and the international winner and the winner of the world distance title. Many tournaments were held at the site. The largest on record was the1932 National tournament when 15,000-20,000 people attended. Tournaments declined in the 1930s. Cost increases and slowing attendance prompted the last Central U.S. tournament in 1936. The last national event was in 1957. Snow was scarce so it was truck in from Spirit Lake and Lake Okoboji, Iowa. By the time the snow was in place, it had turned into slush. Winds changed and brought bitter temperatures causing the slush to freeze. The tournament had to be cancelled. The ski hill is all that remains of the tournament site.

==Hiawatha Insane Asylum==
{{main|Canton Indian Insane Asylum}}

The first and only institution for insane Indians in the United States was Hiawatha Asylum for Insane Indians.  It was placed in Canton because of the central location among the Western states with a large Indian populations and because of the influence of South Dakota's Representative O.S. Gifford and Senator R. F. Pettigrew. In 1898, Congress passed a bill creating the institution. The bill establishing the Hiawatha Asylum for Insane Indians passed in 1899, and the Indian Appropriation Act for 1900 set aside $3,000 for land purchase and $42,000 for building cThe brown catonstruction. One hundred acres were purchased a mile east of Canton on the hills overlooking the Sioux River. The asylum was closed in 1934.

The asylum grounds and buildings were used for a short time by South Dakota as a penitentiary for first time offenders. In 1946, in what Cantonites refer to as the &quot;second Manhattan Purchase,&quot; the city purchased for $1.00 the 337 acres and buildings of the old institution.  The only stipulation of the purchases was that it be used for the welfare of the community. For a time, the asylum hospital was used for the Canton-Inwood Hospital, but today the old asylum buildings are gone.  The land is now home to Sanford Hospital Canton-Inwood, Three Rivers Gun Club, the 4-H fairground and Hiawatha County Club and Golf Course.

Today, a cemetery for 121 patients of the asylum is located on the original grounds of the asylum. The National Park Service added the cemetery to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[http://crm.cr.nps.gov/archive/22-9/22-09-16.pdf &quot;Canton Indian Historical Society&quot;], National Parks Service.

'''Custer''' is a city in [[Custer County, South Dakota|Custer County]], [[South Dakota]], [[United States]]. The population was 2,067 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].  It is the [[county seat]] of [[Custer County, South Dakota|Custer County]].{{GR|6}}

==History==
[[Image:CusterCity1876front.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Oxen-drawn freight team entering Custer in 1876]]
Custer is generally considered to be the oldest town established by European Americans in the [[Black Hills]] of South Dakota and Wyoming.  The site of one of the major encampments of the Black Hills Expedition led by of Lt. Colonel) [[George Armstrong Custer]]'s [[7th Cavalry]] in 1874, which made the first public discovery of [[gold]] in the Black Hills. 

For thousands of years, the Black Hills had been part of the territory of varying tribes of [[indigenous peoples]]. They were within historical territory of the [[Oglala Sioux]] at the time of United States encounter, and within the [[Great Sioux Reservation]] established by the US [[Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868)]]. Having established dominance in the area by the eighteenth century, the Oglala Sioux had long considered the Black Hills as sacred land. 

After increasing encroachment by European Americans and violent confrontations, the US government forced the Sioux to cede much of the Black Hills in 1877, and opened the land for individual purchase and settlement.  In 1875 trespassing gold-boomers named their settlement Stonewall (after the Confederate general, [[Stonewall Jackson]]), but it was renamed for Custer. Almost abandoned in 1876 after word of the much larger gold strikes in Deadwood Gulch spread, Custer later became an established city.  

Custer has had a smaller population and been less wealthy than the Northern Hills cities of [[Deadwood, South Dakota|Deadwood]] and [[Lead, South Dakota|Lead]]. In addition to gold, Custer and other cities based their economies on the extraction of industrial minerals, which are still important to the regional economy.  Custer claims to have the widest Main Street in the United States. The city made the street wide enough in the nineteenth century for a team of oxen pulling a wagon to turn completely around.  

Custer annually observes a &quot;Gold Discovery Days&quot; celebration and festivities over the last full weekend of July.  This [[heritage tourism]] event celebrates the discovery of gold by the Custer expedition in nearby French Creek and the subsequent founding of the town.

==Geography==

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|2.54|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which, {{convert|2.53|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.01|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.&lt;ref name =&quot;Gazetteer files&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the incorporated city has a small population, many residents associated with it and the workforce live outside the city limits in unincorporated Custer County.

==Economy==
[[Image:Custer south dakota post office 2009.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Custer Post Office]]
In addition to continued mining of precious metals, industrial minerals form the basis of today's local mining industry.  Timber harvesting and production, tourism, and government services form the basis for the economy.  Custer is the headquarters for the Supervisor of the [[Black Hills National Forest]] of [[South Dakota]] and [[Wyoming]].  It is convenient to major tourist attractions, such as [[Jewel Cave National Monument]], [[Wind Cave National Park]], [[Custer State Park]], and [[Mount Rushmore National Memorial]].  The [[Crazy Horse Memorial]] is located just north of the city.

The South Dakota State Treatment and Rehabilitation Academy is located south of town and partially within Custer State Park.  The Department of Corrections operates the facility for juvenile offenders.

Custer is home to the [[Bedrock City (South Dakota)|Bedrock City]] campground, which attracts visitors to its construction of the fictional town of Bedrock from the animated television series ''[[The Flintstones]]''. 

Custer State Park, just outside of town, is one of the major tourist destinations in the area during the summer. During the fall, the visitors are mostly hunters hoping to kill deer or turkey in the surrounding forest.

'''Gregory''' is a city in [[Gregory County, South Dakota|Gregory County]], [[South Dakota]], [[United States]]. The population was 1,295 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].

==History==
As the United States was racing into the 20th century, Gregory County was part of the &quot;Last Frontier&quot; opened to settlers. The Arikara and Ree Indians had long since vanished. The Sioux, who roamed the area since the mid-19th century, had been relegated to the Rosebud, Pine Ridge, Cheyenne, Standing Rock and Lower Brule reservations, and an ambitious congressman had persuaded President Theodore Roosevelt to open the territory for settlement. {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

The presidential proclamation was made public on May 15, 1904 which opened western Gregory County for settlement. Registration was held throughout the month of July, and on the 28th of that month, 2600 lucky land seekers received their {{convert|160|acre|km2|adj=on}} tracts.

August 8, 1904, Gregory was formally opened to the public as a government town-site. By June 23, 1905, Gregory was boasting 250 buildings and 500 inhabitants that filled an area which consisted of four surveyor's holes and a stake just the August before. Some of the larger businesses included two banks, two hardware stores, a meat market, two lumber companies, three hotels, a restaurant, a grocery, a furniture store, a pool hall, a photographer's studio, a drug store, two newspapers, three livery barns and three blacksmith and machine shops. The community also now had a public school with 56 pupils, a U.S. Land Commissioner, and the Interstate Telephone Company was building an exchange.

By 1906, land that had sold the previous year for $500 to $800 per quarter was selling for $2500 to $3500 per quarter. The year 1906 also brought news that the railroad had contracted for the first stretch of track from Bonesteel to Gregory.

In 1907, Gregory citizens voted to construct a $12,000 water works, and investors agreed to install electric lights. Local businessmen constructed a City Hall, and an Opera House Company organized for the purpose of constructing an opera house and town hall.

By the end of 1908, the great registration for the Tripp County lands was on, and fifteen regular trains arrived in Gregory daily, packed with passengers.

From these beginnings, Gregory continued to grow and prosper, making its mark as a service center for the farmers and ranchers in the area. The hospitality and service-oriented people of the community continued to cater to the residents of the area. Honest, hard-working people continue to make up the core of the area's population, making Gregory today a tremendous place to live and grow.

'''Harrisburg''' is a city in [[Lincoln County, South Dakota|Lincoln County]], [[South Dakota]], [[United States]] and is a suburb of [[Sioux Falls, South Dakota|Sioux Falls]]. The population was 4,089 by the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], having grown from 958 in [[2000 United States Census|2000]]. The population of the Harrisburg zip code has grown from 2,476 in 2000 to 10,342 in 2010.

==History==
Before the railroad was built through Lincoln County, a stagecoach brought mail to the Johnson Harris Homestead located on Nine Mile Creek in Dayton Township. Johnson Harris named the post office Harrisburg in honor of himself.&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot;&gt;Harrisburg Economic Development Board, [http://www.harrisburg.govoffice.com/vertical/sites/%7BA7E6811A-D879-4C7C-A19F-F0A55FD49B95%7D/uploads/Harrisburg_Layout_LoRes.pdf, &quot;History&quot;], &quot;Harrisburg South Dakota Community Profile&quot;, 2011-2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of Harrisburg started August 1, 1879, when the first train came rolling through the territory. The train went from Sioux City, Iowa, to Sioux Falls, South Dakota. The post office was moved to the Emory J. Darling Homestead, 1 mile south of what is now Harrisburg. The post office was called Salina in honor of Mrs. Jim Stillwell, an early settler and a highly respected teacher.&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot;/&gt;

Finally in 1890, the depot was moved to its present site. The post office took back its original name and the town of Harrisburg was born.

One of the many early businesses in Harrisburg was the State Bank circa 1901-1945. The bank's building is still located in its original spot at 101 Railroad Ave.&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot;/&gt; The bank itself was built in 1899 and completely restored in 2006 by its current owner RISE, Inc. is a construction management/structural engineering firm.&lt;ref&gt;RISE, Incorporated, [http://www.riseincorp.com/about_company/contact.php &quot;Contact RISE Inc.&quot;], RISE Incorporated, 4 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Much mystery surrounds the old bank building, including whether or not the infamous bandit, John Dillinger, stopped to rob it. According to popular legend, after Dillinger robbed the bank, he fired a round into the teller counter as a reminder not to follow him out. That bullet hole remains there today.

Whether it was Dillinger who shot the bullet into the teller counter, or not, the hole remains proof of Harrisburg's history.&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot;/&gt;

==Government==
City government: The city of Harrisburg is led by a mayor-council (weak mayor) form of government. Mayoral elections occur every four years. City council seats are contested every three years; However, not all of the council members are elected in the same year. The council consists of four members elected to represent two wards. The council member position is designed to be part-time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.harrisburg.govoffice.com/index.asp?Type=B_DIR&amp;SEC=%7BF21C4171-1B65-411A-B228-BB3B994AE7EF%7D&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main Street==
Hosmer Main Street is home of the Hosmer City Hall, the Veterinary Clinic, the City Liquor Store, a US Post Office, the Dakota Café, MA's Noodle Company, L and M Wrecking, Jan Anderson’s Shop, Ron’s Machine, Treichel Insurance, the Hosmer Civic Center, the VFW, Isaac’s Building, Farmers State Bank, Malsam Carpentry, and the Catholic Church.

==Government==
The mayor of Hosmer is currently Mike Schwingler.  The Finance Officer is currently Ron Imberri.  City maintenance is currently headed by Pete Eisenbeisz.

==Dining==
There is one café and two bars in Hosmer where one can find something to eat, all of which are located on Main Street.  The Dakota Café is owned by the city, but is rented to individuals for management.  Although the Dakota Café has gone through quite a few managers throughout its history, it has continually maintained a place for locals and passers-by to congregate and enjoy a good menu for breakfast, dinners, and suppers.  The Hosmer City Liquor Store serves on and off sale liquor as well as appetizers and menu items.  The liquor store is owned and operated by the city of Hosmer.  Steak frys, featuring Heier's steaks and from-scratch homemade noodle salad, are held most every Monday night throughout the winter months, and are open to all.  The City Liquor Store is also known for their excellent Bloody Marys.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}  The VFW serves on and off-sale liquor as well as appetizers, and also holds displays of local heroes and Hosmer history alike.

==Germans from Russia Foods==
Several food items are sold throughout the state of South Dakota that are derivative of the Hosmer people’s heritage.  Three main staples of Hosmer’s Germans from Russia heritage are Kuchen, German Style Noodles, and German Style Sausage.  Kuchen, pronounced coo-gan, is made locally by Judy Weishaar, proprietor of Judy’s Salon, and sold at Heier’s Grocery in Hosmer.  The Kuchen made in Hosmer is most similar to the description of Käsekuchen.  German Style Noodles are made at the Hosmer Noodle Factory, located on Main Street Hosmer, and have been enjoyed from as far away as South America in a Sunday Soup made there.  German Style Sausage is made at Heier’s Meat Market, operated by Heier brothers, and sold throughout the state.  Even though many Hosmer locals make their own sausages and take pride in it, Heier’s sausage is still revered by most.

==Schools==
Hosmer was home to the Hosmer Tigers until the end of the 1990-1991 school year, when they combined with the Roscoe Hornets of Roscoe, South Dakota, to make Edmunds Central, home of the Raiders.  The Hosmer school was then used for some of the Edmunds Central elementary classes.  The school in Hosmer is now closed.  Due to the state's open enrollment policy, parents may choose to send their children where they wish, although most primary and secondary students living in the Hosmer school district have continued attending Edmunds Central in Roscoe.

==Economics==
Hosmer can be considered a farming community, and as the case for most farming communities, they have seen a decline in population.  As farms grow larger, populations of farming communities grow smaller.  The decline in population is hard on all of Hosmer's businesses.  Hosmer’s largest single employer, the Hosmer Nursing Home, has endured years of tough times.  The Hosmer Nursing Home suffers from a low resident attendance and a low employee salary, even though it offers a better than quality treatment of its residents.  The outstanding care of the residents can be attributed to the dedication and hard work of the employees, as well as to the individual attention given in mind to all resident well being.

==Hosmer Quasquicentennial==
Hosmer is celebrating their 125th Birthday on June 29, 30, and July 1, 2012.  As part of the celebration, the Hosmer Quasquicentennial Committee are planning numerous events, such as: a free meal, parade, car show, dances, entertainment under the tent, and kid's entertainment in the park.

It is the [[county seat]] of [[Fall River County, South Dakota|Fall River County]].&lt;ref name=frc&gt;{{cite web|title=Welcome|publisher=South Dakota Association of County Officials|url=http://www.sdcounties.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=28&amp;Itemid=43|accessdate=2009-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, neighboring [[Shannon County, South Dakota|Shannon County]] contracts the duties of Auditor, Treasurer and Register of Deeds to the Fall River County authority in Hot Springs.&lt;ref name=frc/&gt;

==Overview==
Hot Springs is one of the warmest places in South Dakota with an annual mean temperature of {{convert|48.6|°F}}.&lt;ref name=wrcc&gt;{{cite web|title=Hot Springs, South Dakota 1961-1990 NCDC Monthly Normals |url=http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliMAIN.pl?sd4007|publisher=[[Western Regional Climate Center]]|accessdate=2009-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the attractions in the Hot Springs area are the [[Mammoth Site, Hot Springs|Mammoth Site of Hot Springs]] and Evans Plunge, built in 1890, with its naturally warm {{convert|87|°F}} [[spring (hydrosphere)|spring]] water.  The town is a gateway to the attractions of the southern [[Black Hills]], particularly [[Wind Cave National Park]]. Hot Springs holds the annual [[Miss South Dakota]] pageant. In recognition of its historic value, the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]] listed Hot Springs as one of its 2009 Dozen Distinctive Destinations.&lt;ref name=trust/&gt;

The 100-bed center offers extensive outpatient treatment, acute hospital care, [[PTSD]] treatment, and an alcohol and drug treatment facility.

The Battle Mountain Sanitarium was declared a National Treasure by the National Trust for Historic Preservation following a December 2011 proposal announced by the Department of Veterans Affairs to close the facility, which was also met with protest from the community &amp; state leaders, including Senator [[Tim Johnson (U.S. Senator)|Tim Johnson]], Senator [[John Thune]], and Representative [[Kristi Noem]]. A concerned group of citizens organized the Save the VA Campaign and have designed a counter-proposal for a National Demonstration Project to create a self-sufficient VA program for veterans from all across America.

==History==
The [[Sioux]] and [[Cheyenne]] people frequented the area, appreciating its warm springs. European settlers arrived in the second half of the 19th century. The city, first known as Minnekahta, was renamed in 1882 and a variety of health resorts were built on the basis of the springs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hot Springs, South Dakota|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/683054/Hot-Springs|accessdate=2009-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government==
The City of Huron's type of government is Commissioner Form. Under the Commissioner Form of government the board of commissioners consists of a mayor and four commissioners, who are all elected at large for a three-year term. The commission has control over all departments of the city and can make and enforce rules and regulations which it may see fit for the organization, management, and operation of the departments of the city. Responsibilities are divided into the following areas: Public Safety Commissioner, Public Works Commissioner, Utilities Commissioner, and Finance Commissioner with each commissioner having oversight in each respective area.

==History==
Huron, located in east central South Dakota, is a result of railroad and land booms in the 1880s.  The early history of the town is closely linked with the Chicago and Northwestern Railway.  At the direction of Marvin Hughitt, General Manager of the Railroad, the west bank of the James River was selected as the division headquarters of the railroad.  The company gained title to {{convert|880|acre|km2}} of land at that location. Huron was named for the Huron Indians. Exactly who gave it the name was never established, apparently either Marvin Hughitt or someone in the Chicago office of the C&amp;NW railroad company.

The original plat covered 11 blocks from 1st Street to 3rd Street and from Iowa Avenue SE to Ohio Avenue SW. Huron’s first settler was John Cain, a practical printer from Troy, New York.  He learned in Chicago, from the railroad people, that they would have their chief town and operating headquarters at their James River crossing.

From 1880 until the capital was permanently located at [[Pierre, South Dakota|Pierre]] in 1904, Huron was in the thick of the fight for the honor of being the capital city.  Campbell and Winter Parks are the only remaining properties that were once designated capital grounds. Located between the two parks, Victorian houses originally built around 1906 occupy the city block on the land originally slated for the capitol building.

The site of the South Dakota State Fair is in Huron. Huron is the home to a handful of celebrities. Cheryl Ladd is one of the original &quot;Charlie's Angels&quot;. Gladys Pyle was the first female member of the House of Representatives and the first Republican woman in the US Senate. Hubert H. Humphrey was the Democratic nominee for President in 1968 and served as Vice President under Lyndon B. Johnson.

by American novelist [[Laura Ingalls Wilder]].  In the very severe winter of 1880-1881, a neighbor of Ingalls, David Gilbert, volunteered to make the very risky run from [[De Smet, South Dakota]] to Lake Preston (called, at that time, simply &quot;Preston, [[Dakota Territory]]&quot;)
to take outgoing mail and bring back the incoming mail.  Though the distance was only about 10 miles, the trip was dangerous because of blizzards coming up very quickly throughout that winter, and a person caught on the prairie during a blizzard had almost no chance of survival.

'''Mission''' is a city in [[Todd County, South Dakota|Todd County]], [[South Dakota]], [[United States]], and the Rosebud Indian Reservation. The population was 1,182 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].

Mission is home of the [[Sinte Gleska University]]. It is the largest incorporated community in the county, but is smaller than the unincorporated community of Rosebud, which is the capital of the [[Rosebud Sioux Tribe]].  It is named for one of the many [[Mission (Christianity)|missions]] established by religious groups in the late 19th century to assist the Sicangu [[Lakota people|Lakota]] (Rosebud Sioux) and other Native American people.  The major economical center of the county, it is located at the junction of [[US-83]] and [[US-18]] (the Oyate Trail, the home of Todd County School District, Cherry-Todd Rural Electric Cooperative, and various federal/tribal agencies). On episodes of ''[[The Price is Right]]'', the host [[Bob Barker]] — who is 1/8 Sioux — noted that Mission was the town in which he spent his childhood while his mother worked as a teacher on the Indian reservation.

==Attractions==
Mitchell is home of the [[Corn Palace]]. The Corn Palace is decorated with several colors of dried corn and grains, creating murals. The theme of the external murals is changed yearly at fall harvest; internal murals are changed approximately every ten years. The building itself is used for several purposes including a basketball arena, the local high school prom, trade shows, staged entertainment, and the Shriner's Circus.

Mitchell is also the home of the [http://www.dakotadiscovery.com Dakota Discovery Museum], whose mission is to present and preserve the history of the prairie and the people who settled it.  The museum covers the time period from 1600, when the Native Americans were still largely undiscovered, to 1939, the end of the [[Great Depression]].  The museum holds one of the most complete and pristine collections of American Indian quill and bead-works.  The Dakota Discovery Museum also features artists such as [[Harvey Dunn]], [[James Earle Fraser (sculptor)|James Earle Fraser]], [[Charles Hargens]] and [[Oscar Howe]].  In the village area behind the main building are four authentic historical buildings, including an 1885 one-room school house and the fully furnished 1886 Victorian-Italianate home of the co-founder of the Corn Palace, Louis Beckwith.  Two new features of the museum are Discovery Land, a hands-on activity area for children ages five to ten, and the Heritage Gardens Project, which brings indigenous plants to the gardens surrounding the museum and historical buildings.

The [http://www.mitchellindianvillage.org/ Mitchell Prehistoric Indian Village], [[Mitchell Site|an archaeological site]] where scientists are excavating a Native American village, is another attraction in the city. The site, near Lake Mitchell, is believed to have been occupied by ancestors of the present-day [[Mandan]], who now reside in [[North Dakota]].  The excavation is unique in that it is enclosed by an Archeodome, a climate-controlled building built over the site, which allows scientists to continue their excavation work year-round.

The Mitchell area also boasts several state [[champion tree]]s: [[Prunus serotina|Black Cherry]], [[Black Locust]], [[Siberian Elm]], and [[Tulip Tree]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sdda.sd.gov/conservation-forestry/big-tree-register/current-list/  South Dakota Register of Big Trees]&lt;/ref&gt;

French-Canadian farmer Joseph La Plant, born ca. 1823 in Indiana, settled at '''Sioux Point''' in 1849 and is listed with other early settlers in the [[1860 United States Census|1860 census]] as living &quot;Between Big Sioux and [[Big Stone Lake]]&quot; in the &quot;Unorganized&quot; area of [[Minnesota]], with the closest post office located immediately down and across the rivers in [[Sioux City]], Iowa.

North Sioux City was incorporated in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.city-data.com/city/North-Sioux-City-South-Dakota.html|title= North Sioux City, South Dakota|publisher=City-data.com|accessdate=July 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Platte''' is a city in [[Charles Mix County, South Dakota]], United States. The population was 1,230 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. The community is named after the Platte Creek, a tributary of the [[Missouri River]] reservoir [[Lake Francis Case]].  Platte is located 15 miles east of the lake.

== History ==

[[Lewis and Clark]] were told to watch for ‘burning bluffs’ in the area.&lt;ref name=&quot;South Dakota Game, Fish, and Parks&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Platte Creek Recreation Area|url=http://gfp.sd.gov/state-parks/directory/platte-creek/|publisher=South Dakota Game, Fish, and Parks|accessdate=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Settlement didn’t begin until the early 1880s.&lt;ref name=&quot;South Dakota Game, Fish, and Parks&quot; /&gt;    A fur trader named Bernard Pratte once lived at the mouth of what was then known as the ‘Fish Creek’.&lt;ref name=&quot;South Dakota Game, Fish, and Parks&quot; /&gt;    Pratte’s last name was mistakenly transcribed as Platte on an early map of the creek and the spelling error stuck.&lt;ref name=&quot;Platte Info&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Platte Info|url=http://kingsinnmotel.com/4.html|publisher=King's Inn|accessdate=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The town that would become Platte was named after the creek.&lt;ref name=&quot;Platte Info&quot; /&gt;

For 12 years, Charles Mix County was the only county in the state of South Dakota without a railroad.&lt;ref name=&quot;Platte Heritage Club&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Platte|url=http://www.plattesd.org/about-platte/history-of-platte|accessdate=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Platte originated in the summer of 1900 after it was selected as the terminus for a [[Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad|Chicago, Milwaukee, and St. Paul]] railroad branch line from [[Yankton, South Dakota|Yankton]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Platte Heritage Club&quot; /&gt;   The railroad arrived in October and buildings were moved from the nearby settlements of Castalia, Old Platte, and Edgerton.&lt;ref name=&quot;Platte Heritage Club&quot; /&gt;   The Platte Enterprise newspaper was founded in 1900 and is still published today.&lt;ref name=&quot;Platte Info&quot; /&gt;

The [[Great Depression]] and drought of the 1930s led to unemployment and out-migration in the area.&lt;ref name=&quot;Platte Heritage Club&quot; /&gt;   A dam was constructed on the Platte Creek during this time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Platte Info&quot; /&gt;   The area became a place for picnics and recreation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Platte Info&quot; /&gt;   In 1956, the [[Fort Randall Dam]] was completed creating Lake Francis Case.&lt;ref name=&quot;Platte Heritage Club&quot; /&gt;   In 1966, the Platte-Winner Bridge was completed over the lake giving travelers a new route to and from the Black Hills.&lt;ref name=&quot;Platte Heritage Club&quot; /&gt;

'''Redfield''' is a city in and the [[county seat]] of [[Spink County, South Dakota|Spink County]], [[South Dakota]], [[United States]].{{GR|6}} The population was 2,333 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. The city is not to be confused with the surrounding [[Redfield Township, Spink County, South Dakota|Redfield Township]], which encompasses [[unincorporated area]]s outside of the city limits.

==Geography==
Redfield is located at {{coord|44.875145|-98.517850|type:city_region:US|format=dms|display=inline}}.{{GR|1}}

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|1.92|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which, {{convert|1.89|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.03|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.&lt;ref name =&quot;Gazetteer files&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Redfield has been assigned the [[ZIP code]] 57469 and the [[FIPS place code]] 53460.

==History==
The first settlers arrived in the Redfield area in 1878, and a post office was established two years later under the name &quot;Stennett Junction.&quot; The &quot;Redfield&quot; name was adopted in 1881. The town became the seat of [[Spink County, South Dakota|Spink County]] in 1886, following a six year legal and political battle among several Spink County towns. Redfield rapidly became a major town in the region, due in part to its status as a railroad center—the town was a crossroads of two lines of the [[Chicago and North Western Railway]], and was also served by the [[Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad|Milwaukee Road]] Railroad. Railroads brought supplies, people, and animals, and also provided for transportation of crops back East.

[[Redfield College (South Dakota)|Redfield College]] was established in the town in 1887, and operated until 1932. In 1902 the &quot;Northern Hospital for the Insane,&quot; a state institution, opened on a campus just north of town. That facility remains in operation today as the [[South Dakota Developmental Center]].

==Tornado==
On May 30, 1998, the most destructive and second deadliest tornado in South Dakota history—and the most intensely observed and analyzed—struck Spencer. It began as a large, dust-cloaked tornado NW of [[Farmer, South Dakota]] in [[Hanson County, South Dakota|Hanson County]], concurrent with the demise of the &quot;Fulton&quot; tornado. Continuing toward the ESE, it struck several farmsteads before crossing the Hanson/McCook County line a half mile WNW of Spencer. At this time, the tornado was being observed by the OU Doppler on Wheels crew, whose mobile Doppler radar data showed up to 246&amp;nbsp;mph winds in the tornado a few tens of meters above ground level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spc.noaa.gov/misc/spencer/ NOAA summary, from which the text is nearly a direct quote]&lt;/ref&gt; The population of the town diminished soon after to less than half of what it was previous to the tornado, from 315 to 145 in April 1999.

==History==
[[File:Watertown, SD 1883.jpg|thumb|left|An 1883 bird's eye illustration of Watertown]]
Watertown was founded in 1879 as a rail terminus when the [[Chicago &amp; Northwestern Railroad]] reactivated part of a line it had constructed to [[Lake Kampeska]].&lt;ref name=Hasselstrom29/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thompson (ed.), p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; The city was named after [[Watertown, New York]], the hometown of brothers John E. Kemp and Oscar P. Kemp, some of the city's founders.&lt;ref name=Hasselstrom29/&gt;

During the 1880s, Watertown prospered as a transportation hub after the railroads had been extended further west. Along with several other cities, Watertown had been a candidate as capital of the new state of South Dakota,&lt;ref name=Hasselstrom29/&gt; although it lost out to the more centrally located [[Pierre, South Dakota|Pierre]]. The city's current newspaper, the ''[[Watertown Public Opinion]]'', began publishing in 1887.&lt;ref name=Hasselstrom29/&gt;

In the mid-20th century, [[Interstate 29]] was constructed through eastern South Dakota.&lt;ref name=Schell333&gt;Schell, p. 333.&lt;/ref&gt; The route included a slight bend to bring the highway closer to Watertown.&lt;ref name=Schell333/&gt; The interstate's construction has been a major economic benefit to the larger communities along its route, including Watertown.&lt;ref name=Schell333/&gt;

'''Faith''' is a city in [[Meade County, South Dakota|Meade County]], [[South Dakota]], [[United States]]. The population was 421 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. [[Sue (dinosaur)|Sue]], the most complete ''[[Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' skeleton known, was discovered about 15&amp;nbsp;miles north and east of Faith in August 1990.

== History ==
Local residents have been known to say the town was named Faith because it took [[faith]] to live out on the [[prairie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.frontdoor.com/city-guide/faith-sd-usa|title= About Faith|publisher= HGTV Front Door
|accessdate=July 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the story of the city as documented in various informal, locally published histories, is that the town was named for [[Faith Rockefeller]], one of the daughters of a major investor in the railroad responsible for founding the town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.faithsd.com/|title= City of Faith, South Dakota|publisher= City of Faith, South Dakota
|accessdate=July 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in keeping with the names of other towns on the route of the old railroad (now abandoned), such as [[Isabel, South Dakota]]. Faith was the permanent end of the railroad, a local spur off the Milwaukee Road Railroad. The city was established in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.faithsd.com/|title= City of Faith, South Dakota|publisher= City of Faith, South Dakota|accessdate=July 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
Faith is located at {{coord|45|1|18|N|102|2|22|W|type:city}} (45.021648, -102.039502).{{GR|1}}

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|1.20|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, all of it land.&lt;ref name =&quot;Gazetteer files&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Infrastructure==

=== Transportation ===
Faith is accessed from [[U.S. Route 212]], and South Dakota state highway 73. The nearest commercial airports are located at [[Pierre, South Dakota|Pierre]], the state capital, and [[Rapid City, South Dakota|Rapid City]], the major market city of the region, located 100&amp;nbsp;miles to the southwest. The railroad was constructed in 1910 and abandoned in the 1960s; there is presently no scheduled passenger bus service or freight service to the city.

==Region==
Faith is located in the [[West River]] region of [[South Dakota]], that part of the state located west of the [[Missouri River]], and in the [[Northern Great Plains]], on a ridge dividing the [[Cheyenne River]] to the south and the [[Grand River (South Dakota)|Grand River]] and its major tributary, the [[Moreau River]] to the north (both are tributaries of the Missouri). Faith is the center of a vast cattle and sheep ranching area, and is the community center for hundreds of scattered ranchsteads. It is located in the extreme northeast corner of Meade County, South Dakota's largest: it is approximately 75&amp;nbsp;miles to [[Sturgis, South Dakota|Sturgis]], the county seat. It is also located immediately west of the boundary of the [[Cheyenne River Indian Reservation]], home to several [[Lakota people|Lakota]] bands organized into the [[Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe]] or CRST. The region is well known for deer hunting and also offers pheasant, elk, and recently, prairie mountain lion hunting. A small reservoir, Durkee Lake, is approximately three miles south and offers a local recreation venue, with its boating, fishing, golf course, beach, and camping.

==Past and Future==
Founded as the town at the end of the railroad, Faith was originally the hub of a homestead boom in the period 1910-1920; but the drought conditions of the 1920s that led to the [[Dust Bowl]] of the 1930s quickly replaced abnormally wet conditions of the early 20th Century, and the harsh winters of the Northern Plains quickly drove many sodbusters to more hospitable regions. The town's location allows for ranch families in the area to have schools and stores closer than Sturgis, Fort Pierre, or other regional market towns, but early expectations of steady growth were never realized. Faith is still well known for its rodeos and livestock sales. The town's location made it a necessary stop on the [[Sunset Trail]] also known as the [[Yellowstone Trail]].

Although like most small rural cities of the Great Plains, Faith has declined in population, its distance from alternative locations for schools and businesses and its geographic location near county and reservation boundaries mean that it is unlikely to become a ghost town or see its institutions consolidated out of existence.

==Notable residents==
* [[Catherine Bach]], actress
* [[Boyd Raeburn]], jazz bandleader and Baritone saxophonist (1913–1966)

==History==

===Pioneer===
Both county and the city were named after one of [[South Dakota]]'s pioneer promoters, [[Wilmot Brookings|Wilmot Wood Brookings]] (1830 - 1905). Brookings set out for the [[Dakota Territory]] in June 1857. He arrived at [[Sioux Falls]] on August 27, 1857, and became one of the first settlers there. He and his group represented the [[Western Town Company]]. After a time in [[Sioux Falls]], [[Wilmot Brookings|Brookings]] and a companion set out for the [[Yankton]] area to locate a town in an area that was soon to be ceded by the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]]. This trip was begun in January 1858, and the two soon encountered a blizzard that froze [[Wilmot Brookings|Brookings]]' feet which both had to be amputated.

[[File:Brookings court house.jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[Brookings County, South Dakota|Brookings County]] Courthouse]]
He rose to a high position in the Territory, once being a member of the Squatter Territorial Legislature and later being elected Squatter Governor. [[Wilmot Brookings|Brookings]] then became appointed superintendent of a road that was to be built from the Minnesota state line west to the [[Missouri River]] about 30 miles north of [[Fort Pierre, South Dakota|Ft. Pierre]]. It was during the construction of this road that [[Wilmot Brookings|Brookings]] came into contact with land that was part of this county at the time. Because of his drive to settle the [[Dakota Territory]], Brookings County and city were named for a spirited pioneer promoter. Wilmot W. Brookings made settlement of this area a real possibility for many people.

===Medary===
The first real town that was organized in [[Brookings County]] was [[Medary, South Dakota|Medary]] in 1857. Up to this point, the area had been traveled and utilized by only Native Americans, with a few indistinct traces left showing the penetration of the area by explorers, missionaries, trappers, and traders. Along with Sioux Falls and Flandreau, Medary was one of the first three European settlements to be established in [[South Dakota]].

The first actual site of Medary was located by the [[Dakota Land Company]] out of [[Minnesota]] which was led by Alpheus G. Fuller and Major Franklin J. DeWitt and accompanied by engineer Samuel A. Medary, Jr. In 1857, the men put up quarters in preparation to live out the winter in Medary. Many other settlers moved into the area in 1858. But in the spring of that year, a large group of Yankton and Yanktonnia Indians drove the settlers from the area, and Medary remained nearly abandoned for the next 11 years.

In 1869, a group of 10 Norwegian pioneers moved west into the [[Dakota Territory]] and resettled the area of Medary, which was located about four and one half miles south of present-day Brookings. The county of Brookings was formally organized in Medary in the cabin of Martin Trygstad on July 3, 1871. The original boundaries of the county extended to two miles south of Flandreau, until the territorial legislature relocated the boundaries of the county to the current location on January 8, 1873. Two other small settlements, Oakwood and Fountain, appeared in the Brookings County area around this time. All three settlements hoped that they would be the lucky town by which the railroad would decide to lay tracks through as it moved westward but it didn't go through Medary so it became a ghost town.

===Natives===
The first people to inhabit the Brookings area were the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]]. These people are evidenced by mounds found around the Oakwood Lakes area where early inhabitants buried their dead. The Mound Builders have left their legacy to us in the mounds, stone hammers, and stone implements that later Indians and white settlers found as they traversed the area. Many of the Sioux Indians and branches of the Sioux tribe made the area their home, also. Their presence has been accounted by white settlers.

The first white men assumed to have ventured into the Brookings area were fur traders as early as 1750. However, the first white man definitely known to have trekked the Brookings County area was a fur-trader named Joseph LaFramboise. LaFramboise established a trading post near what is now Flandreau. He operated the trading post from 1822 to 1827. It is likely that during the time of his operating the trading post that LaFramboise made his way into the southeastern part of Brookings County.

===Railroad===
As it turned out, none of the three towns were chosen to be passed through by the railroad. When the businessmen of Medary and Fountain found out that the railroad had no plans of laying tracks through the two towns, they began a push to find a central location. In a sense, their attitude was 'if you can't beat 'em, join 'em!' Many private meetings and much effort on the part of the men of Medary and Fountain led to the railroad deciding to lay its tracks through what would become the city of Brookings.

In a letter sent to [[Chicago]] on September 30, 1879, Land Commissioner Charles E. Simmons communicated the layout of the series of towns in Brookings County to be passed through by the railroad. These towns were to be Aurora, Brookings, and Volga. Many merchants of Medary and Fountain packed up their businesses and belongings and moved to Brookings, which was surveyed and platted on October 3 and 4, 1879. Fountain ceased to exist after this turn of events, while Medary and Oakwood continued to exist for a while but eventually faded away. A monument still stands at the site of the old Medary as a reminder of the people who once lived there.

The railroad crossed the [[Minnesota]] state line and into Brookings County on October 2, 1879. With tracks being built at about one mile per day, the track and first train reached Brookings' Main Street on October 18, 1879. The railroad station was opened a month later.

==Early history==
[[File:Flandreau SD 1883.jpg|thumb|right|1883 illustration of Flandreau]]

The town of Flandreau, or possibly Flandrau, was originally settled in 1857, and named for U.S Indian Agent [[Charles Eugene Flandrau|Charles E. Flandrau]].  The settlement, like others in the region was abandoned within a year, as a result of threatening activities of the [[Yankton Sioux]].  In 1869, the town was resettled by twenty-five families of [[Christianization|Christianized]] Sioux from the [[Santee Sioux|Santee]] reservation.  White settlement resumed in 1872. When Moody County was organized in 1873, Flandreau was made the county seat.  [[Richard F. Pettigrew]] of Sioux Falls, a relative of Pettigrew settlers in Flandreau, made the establishment of an Indian School at Flandreau part of his successful 1889 campaign for the U.S. Senate; the Riggs Institute was opened in 1892 and is today known as the Flandreau Indian School.

[[Image:Surveyors house little house on the prairie.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Surveyors' House]]
Since 1971, De Smet has hosted a pageant, held over several weekends in July, to honor Laura Ingalls Wilder. Five of her classic ''Little House'' books were based on her experiences in and around the community.

The story of how [[Charles Ingalls]] and his wife Caroline arrived in De Smet in 1879 by [[covered wagon]] from [[Walnut Grove, Minnesota]], is told by a cast of thirty in an open-air theater near the old Ingalls homestead and the Surveyors' House. Nearby are [[Silver Lake (Kingsbury County, South Dakota)|Silver Lake]] and the [[Big Slough (Kingsbury County, South Dakota)|Big Slough]], locations mentioned in her books. Reminders of De Smet's pioneer past are evident throughout the town, including the First Congregational Church, where the Ingallses worshipped. Laura, husband Almanzo Wilder, and daughter Rose left De Smet in 1894 to live on a farm in the [[Ozarks]] near [[Mansfield, Missouri]]. There Laura Ingalls chronicled her De Smet memories in such works as ''The Long Winter'', ''Little Town on the Prairie,'' and ''These Happy Golden Years''. Many residents in De Smet have made a special effort to learn the Ingalls story in hopes of assisting inquiring tourists each summer.&lt;ref&gt;Chuck Cecil, &quot;Little Town on the Prairie,&quot; ''American Profile'', June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Spearfish''' is a city in [[Lawrence County, South Dakota|Lawrence County]], [[South Dakota]], [[United States]]. The population was 10,494 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].

==History==
Prior to the [[Black Hills Gold Rush]] of 1876, the area was used by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]]s (primarily bands of [[Sioux]] but others also ranged through the area) who would spear fish in the creek (hence the name of the creek and subsequently the town). Once the gold rush started, the city was founded in 1876 at the mouth of [[Spearfish Canyon]], and was originally called Queen City.&lt;ref name=&quot;visit&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.visitspearfish.com/aboutspearfish/history/ |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=History |date= |website=Visit Spearfish, South Dakota |publisher= |accessdate=November 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spearfish grew as a supplier of foodstuffs to the [[Gold mining|mining]] camps in the hills. Even today, a significant amount of [[truck farming]] and [[market gardening]] still occurs in the vicinity.

In 1887, the accepted history of gold mining in the Black Hills was thrown into question by the discovery of what has become known as the Thoen Stone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackhillsvisitor.com/main.asp?id=14&amp;cat_id=30299 &quot;The Thoen Stone&quot;]. - ''Black Hills Visitor Magazine''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Discovered by Louis Thoen on the slopes of Lookout Mountain, the stone purports to be the last testament of Ezra Kind who, along with six others, entered the Black Hills in 1833 (at a time when whites were forbidden by law and treaty from entering the area), &quot;got all the gold we could carry&quot; in June 1834, and were subsequently &quot;killed by Indians beyond the high hill.&quot;  While it may seem unlikely that someone who has &quot;lost my gun and nothing to eat and Indians hunting me&quot; would take the time to carve his story in sandstone, there is corroborating historical evidence for the Ezra Kind party.&lt;ref&gt;Tallent, Annie D., (1899). - ''The Black Hills, Or, The Last Hunting Ground of the Dakotahs''. - St. Louis, Missouri: Nixon-Jones. - pp.10-11. {{OCLC search link|191327730}}.&lt;br&gt;—Peattie, Roderick (1952). - ''The Black Hills''. - New York, New York: Vanguard Press. - p.58. - {{OCLC search link|490448}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century, the history of Spearfish was tied very closely to mining and tourism. Architect [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], who visited Spearfish Canyon in 1935, later called the area &quot;unique and unparalleled elsewhere in our country,&quot; and wondered, &quot;How is it that I've heard so little of this miracle and we, toward the Atlantic, have heard so much of the Grand Canyon when this is even more miraculous?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spearfishcanyon.com/vegetation.htm &quot;Vegetation-Wright Chronicles&quot;]. - Spearfish Canyon Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Homestake Sawmill (previously part of Pope and Talbot, now owned by Neimen Forest Products) was built to supply timbers for the [[Homestake Mine (South Dakota)|Homestake Mine]] in [[Lead, South Dakota|Lead]] (closed January 2002). In 1938, Joseph Meier brought the Luenen [[Passion Play]] to settle permanently in Spearfish and become the Black Hills Passion Play, drawing thousands of visitors every year during the summer months. After Meier's death in 2007, the amphitheater and {{convert|23|acre|m2}} surrounding it were put up for sale.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siouxcityjournal.com/articles/2007/10/11/news/latest_news/54f39a5c4712d279862573710041f45f.txt &quot;Passion Play property for sale&quot;]. - [[Associated Press]]. - (c/o ''[[Sioux City Journal]]''. - October 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
Spearfish is located at {{coord|44|29|23|N|103|51|9|W|type:city}} (44.489803, -103.852585).{{GR|1}}

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|16.35|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which, {{convert|16.34|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.01|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.&lt;ref name =&quot;Gazetteer files&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spearfish Creek is a fast-moving creek that emerges from [[Spearfish Canyon]] at Spearfish. It runs roughly south to north through the center of town (parallel to Canyon Street), year round. The creek is unusual in that it freezes from the bottom up, instead of icing over.{{Who|date=March 2009}} This unusual phenomenon occurs due to the very fast rate at which the creek flows. This speed prevents ice from forming except along the bottom of the creek bed where friction and turbulence allow the water to slow down long enough to freeze. Since the creek continues to flow atop this ice, the water level of the creek gradually rises as more ice accumulates on the bottom, in some cases causing flooding on the north side of town where the channel is not as deep.&lt;ref name=&quot;visitck&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.visitspearfish.com/thingstodo/outdooractivities/spearfishcreek/ |title=Spearfish Creek |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=Visit Spearfish, South Dakota |publisher= |accessdate=November 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spearfish has been assigned the [[ZIP code]] 57783 and the [[FIPS place code]] 60020. [[Black Hills State University]] has its own ZIP code, 57799.

==Climate==
Given its location at the base of the [[Black Hills]] and its proximity to the [[High Plains (United States)|High Plains]], the climate in Spearfish is highly variable at any time of the year. This is especially true in the winter months.

===World record temperature change===
Spearfish holds the world record for the fastest temperature change.  On January 22, 1943 at about 7:30 a.m. [[Mountain Time Zone|MST]], the temperature in Spearfish was −4°[[Fahrenheit|F]] (−20°[[Celsius|C]]).  The [[Chinook wind]] picked up speed rapidly, and two minutes later (7:32 a.m.) the temperature was +45°F (+7°C) above zero. The 49°F (27°C) rise in two minutes set a world record that still holds.  By 9:00 a.m., the temperature had risen to 54°F (12°C). Suddenly, the chinook died down and the temperature tumbled back to −4°F (−20°C). The 58°F (32°C) drop took only 27 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crh.noaa.gov/fsd/?n=fsdtrivia01 &quot;South Dakota Weather History and Trivia January&quot;]. - [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]'s [[National Weather Service]].&lt;br&gt;—Appendix I: – [http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/sgx/research/Guide/weatherextremes.pdf &quot;Weather Extremes&quot;]. - [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]. - (Adobe Acrobat *.PDF document).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parker, Watson (1981). - ''Deadwood: The Golden Years''. - Lincoln, Nebraska: The University of Nebraska. - p.158. - ISBN 978-0-8032-8702-0.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Before the city was incorporated, the town was known as Paris, Dakota Territory.  The city was renamed after Lord [[Charles Beresford]] and was formally incorporated on July 12, 1884.

Mr. John O'Rielly hauled the first load of lumber for the new Beresford Settlement from Hawarden Iowa. Mr. John O'Rielly established the O'Rielley Dray Lines. His son George D. O'Rielly would later take over the family business and start the Beresford Tea and Coffee House.  George’s  wife Amelia Guenzel was the first female mortician in the state of South Dakota and her father George S. Guenzel started the first Funeral Parlor and Furniture Store in the town 1885. Mr. George Guenzel’s best friends and main competitor Mr. Wass started a funeral business a few years later in 1887. The two rivals would help each other through thick and thin, and remained best friends until their deaths. George had the first rubber tired vehicle in the town. The great grand son Mr. Robert Corey of Canton would keep an automtive business in the town until the late 1980s.

It is also mainly a Swiss settlement.

==Climate==
Beresford is located very near to the center of the [[North America]]n continent, far removed from any major bodies of water.  This lends the area a [[humid continental climate]], with hot, humid summers, cold snowy winters, and wide temperature extremes.  Summers can bring daytime temperatures that climb into the 90s Fahrenheit, and winter lows can be well below zero.

==Education==
[[Beresford High School]] is the only high school in the Beresford School District. The Beresford High School and Middle School are located on the South Campus of the Beresford School District, and the Beresford Elementary School is located at the North Campus, along with the Community Education Building, which houses the Beresford Pre-School Program.

==Library==
The Beresford Library was originally conceived and nurtured by the [[Beresford Study Club]].  In 1923, a committee was appointed to come up with the necessary planning and arrangements.  At first, the club members were the ones who contributed books to the library via a book shower, which resulted in forty volumes of [[reference work]]s as well as [[fiction]].  Not long after this, the public was invited to donate books to the collection, and this effort produced another hundred books.  The study club started up a fund for the library foundation, and through various [[fundraising]] efforts accrued $300 for the purchase of more books.&lt;ref name=&quot;75th Diamond Jubilee&quot;&gt;Beresford's 75th Diamond Jubilee, p.24&lt;/ref&gt; In 1924, both the size and popularity of the library were too much for the women of the study club to sponsor, so they appealed to the city attorney to see if the city would take over responsibility, and at the December meeting of the library board meeting that same year, it was officially announced that the city would take over the library.&lt;ref name=&quot;75th Diamond Jubilee&quot;/&gt;

The original library occupied a small area on the second floor of the fire station.  As of 1959, there were approximately 10,000 volumes classified with the [[Dewey Decimal Classification|Dewey Decimal System]].&lt;ref name=&quot;75th Diamond Jubilee&quot;/&gt; In 1963, with the help of the local [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scouts]], the library moved to a new home in the former [[Post Office]] building.  This was also the time when new forms of media were added to the collection, such as talking books, film strips, and movie projectors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Centennial book&quot;&gt;Beresford 1884-1984, edited by the Centennial Book Committee, 1983, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, the library was expanded further by refurbishing the basement, which would house the youth library.  By 1983, the library collection consisted of approximately 20,000 books and much media.&lt;ref name=&quot;Centennial book&quot;/&gt; The current library resides on 3rd Street, and was opened to the public in that venue in the fall of 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Beresford Republic, April 29, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;  The library currently holds nearly 30,000 items.

* [[Don Fedderson]] - Television executive producer and creator of television programs (including ''[[Family Affair]]'',''[[The Lawrence Welk Show]]'', and ''[[My Three Sons]]'').

'''Yankton''' is a city in, and the county seat of, [[Yankton County, South Dakota|Yankton County]], [[South Dakota]], [[United States]]. The population was 14,454 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. Yankton is the principal city of the [[List of Micropolitan Statistical Areas|Yankton Micropolitan Statistical Area]], which includes the entirety of Yankton County, and which had an estimated population of 22,603 as of 2012.

Yankton was the first capital of [[Dakota Territory]]. It is named for the [[Sioux|Yankton]] tribe of [[Sioux|Nakota (Sioux)]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]; Yankton is derived from the Nakota word ''I-hank-ton-wan'' (&quot;the end village&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Riggs, S.R., The Reverend (1852) - ''Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge: Grammar and Dictionary of the Dakota Language'' – Smithsonian Institution/G.P. Putnam, New York, N.Y. pp. 297, 336.&lt;/ref&gt;  Yankton is located on the [[Missouri River]] just downstream of the [[Gavins Point Dam]] and [[Lewis and Clark Lake]] and just upstream of the confluence with the [[James River (Dakotas)|James River]]. The United State National Park Service's headquarters for the [[Missouri (River) National Recreational River|Missouri National Recreational River]] are located in the city. The [[Human Services Center]] was established as a [[psychiatric hospital]] in 1882 and is on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. Yankton is commonly referred to as the &quot;River City&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=City of Yankton, South Dakota|url=http://www.cityofyankton.org/yankton/history/|publisher=South Dakota Magazine|accessdate=20 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to its proximity to the Missouri River and the importance that the river played in the city's settlement and development.  Yankton has also earned the nickname, &quot;Mother City of the Dakotas&quot;, due to the early important role it played in the creation and development of the Dakota Territory, which later became the 39th and 40th U.S. states of North and South Dakota, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://legis.state.sd.us/sessions/2011/Bills/SC18P.htm South Dakota Senate Action, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

===Native Inhabitants===

The current site of Yankton was occupied by the Yankton Sioux (Nakota) prior to the arrival of European settlers.  As part of the vast [[Louisiana Purchase]], the site of Yankton was visited by [[Lewis and Clark]] in 1804. In the journals of the expedition, the explorers write of a meeting on August 30, 1804 with members of the [[Yankton Sioux Tribe]] on a Missouri River bluff presently known as Calumet Bluff. As recently as 1857, the present day site of Yankton was occupied by a village of Yankton Sioux led by Chief ''Pa-le-ne-a-pa-pe'' (&quot;Struck by the Ree&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Kingsbury, George W. (1915) – ''History of Dakota Territory'' – S.J. Clarke Publishing Company, Chicago, Il. – pp. 115&lt;/ref&gt;  Two years later, with the signing of the [[Yankton Treaty|Yankton Treaty of 1858]], the land was opened for settlement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yanktonsd.com/subcategory.cfm?cat_id=4&amp;subcat_id=6 What a Discovery]. - Yankton, South Dakota.&lt;/ref&gt;  The city was founded where the small Rhine Creek (renamed Marne Creek in [[World War I]]) flowed into the Missouri River.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yankton.net/history/ ''Press &amp; Dakotan'' - History of Yankton, South Dakota]&lt;/ref&gt;    The city grew as a stop for steamboats to take on fresh water and supplies, especially after steamboat traffic boomed when gold was discovered in the [[Black Hills]].

===Dakota Territorial Capital===

With two days left in his term, [[President James Buchanan]] signed a law on March 2, 1861 creating Dakota Territory. Yankton was designated as the territorial capital, and newly inaugurated [[President Abraham Lincoln]] appointed his personal physician, William A. Jayne of Springfield, Illinois, as the first territorial governor.&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Milton, John R. (1988) – South Dakota: A History – W.W. Norton and Company, New York, N.Y. – pp. 71&lt;/ref&gt;  The territorial capitol building, a plain, two-story wooden structure, was located at the intersection of Fourth and Capitol Streets;&lt;ref&gt;Karolevitz, Robert F. (1972). Yankton: A Pioneer Past - North Plains Press, Aberdeen, S.D. - pp. 40-41. U.S. Library of Congress Number 72-88949&lt;/ref&gt; the original structure has been demolished, but a replica of the building has been constructed in Yankton's Riverside Park. Yankton served as the territorial capital until 1883 when the capital was moved to [[Bismarck, North Dakota|Bismarck]] (currently in North Dakota).

===Yankton Stockade===

In response to the [[Dakota War of 1862]] in western Minnesota, Governor Jayne issued a proclamation on August 30, 1862 requiring every male between the ages of 18 and 50 in every settlement in eastern Dakota, be formed into militias to protect against expected attacks from the Native Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Kingsbury, George W. (1915) – ''History of Dakota Territory'' – S.J. Clarke Publishing Company, Chicago, Il. – pp. 235-244.&lt;/ref&gt;  In response, the Yankton militia built a stockade at the corner of Third Street and Broadway Avenue of approximately 200,000 square feet.  Settlers from the surrounding area, and as far away as Sioux Falls and Bon Homme County, fled to Yankton in order to seek shelter in the structure.  Although roving bands of Native Americans did approach Yankton over the course of several weeks, no attack ensued, and the stockade was eventually abandoned and torn down.  Although no remnants of the stockcade remain, a monument can now be found at the site of the stockade memorializing this event.

Among the most notable events that occurred in Yankton while capital, [[Jack McCall]], murderer of [[Wild Bill Hickok]] in Deadwood on August 2, 1876, was tried in Yankton for Hickok's murder, found guilty, and was hanged on March 1, 1877 at the age of 24. His body is buried in a Yankton cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;Karolevitz (1972), pp. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Yankton College Conservatory.jpg|left|thumb|215x215px|The conservatory building on the former Yankton College campus - now a federal prison.]]

===Yankton College ===

Due to the urging of The Reverend [[Joseph Ward]] of Yankton, the General Association of Congregational Churches in Dakota Territory voted in May 1881 to establish “Pilgrim College” in Yankton, which was to be the first private institution of higher learning in Dakota.&lt;ref&gt;Karolevitz (1972), pp. 99-100.&lt;/ref&gt;  When the college was incorporated in August 1881, the name had been changed to “Yankton College”.  Classes commenced in October 1882, and [[Yankton College]] played a prominent role in the city for over 100 years.  Then, in 1983, the small liberal arts college was forced to close due to financial insolvency.  After remaining vacant for several years, the historic campus, which is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], was purchased by the United States [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]] for use as a minimum security prison. The [[Federal Prison Camp, Yankton|Federal Prison Camp – Yankton]], currently houses approximately 850 male inmates.

===River Port and the Flood of 1881 ===

Since its founding, Yankton enjoyed a natural advantage as a steamboat landing along the Missouri River due to the fact that its landing stretched along the entire length of the town’s riverfront.&lt;ref&gt;Kingsbury (1915), pp. 567.&lt;/ref&gt; The first steamboat to reach Yankton from St.  Louis arrived in 1859, providing goods and supplies to settlers and fur-traders in upper and central Dakota.&lt;ref&gt;Kingsbury (1915), pp. 568.&lt;/ref&gt;  After that, the city continued to grow, particularly after gold was discovered in the Black Hills in 1874 and prospectors rushed into Dakota Territory.&lt;ref&gt;Kingsbury (1915), pp. 891-896.&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1880, Yankton had become an established riverboat port on the Missouri River, but the city’s status as an important port was literally crushed on March 27, 1881 when an ice dam on the Missouri River burst, sending flood waters and giant blocks of ice flowing towards the town.&lt;ref&gt;Karolevitz (1972), pp. 92-95.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Blasting ice with dynamite from in front of steamer on the ways, by Stanley J. Morrow.png|right|thumb|263x263px|A view of Yankton's riverfront after the flood of March 1881.]] The resulting flood waters continued to accumulate behind the debris, and by March 29, the town’s riverfront and downtown were covered in water, ice and rock, destroying or stranding several riverboats that were moored there. As a result of this flood, and the expansion of railroads as a preferred method of shipping goods (the railroad reached Yankton in 1872, and the rest of Dakota throughout the 1870s),  Yankton’s river boat traffic was reduced, and the city’s role as a prominent stopping point on the way west dwindled over the next several years.&lt;ref&gt;Karolevitz (1972), pp. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Francis Marion Ziebach established the second newspaper in the area that became South Dakota, the ''Weekly Dakotan'', in Yankton on June 6, 1861, bringing his outfit from [[Sioux Falls]] by team and wagon.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, James Melvin (1917). - ''History of American Journalism''. - Houghton Mifflin Company. -  pp.246-247.&lt;br&gt;— Coursey, Oscar William (1917). - ''Who’s Who in South Dakota''. - Educator Supply Company.&lt;br&gt;— NOTE: According to these sources, the first newspaper in what is now South Dakota was the ''Dakota Democrat'' published in Sioux Falls for about four years starting in 1858, and the ''Weekly Dakotan'' was the second newspaper in what is now South Dakota, starting on June 4, 1861.&lt;/ref&gt; A second newspaper, started by Francis Marion Ziebach, is still published today as the Yankton ''Press and Dakotan''.&lt;ref&gt;A South Dakota Guide. - Federal Writer’s Project. - 1938. - p.35.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1882, the [[Human Services Center]] was established as a psychiatric hospital.

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2006}}
{{Cleanup-rewrite|2=section|date=February 2009}}

===Settlement===
Before Aberdeen or Brown County was inhabited by European settlers, it was inhabited by the [[Lakota people|Sioux Indians]] from approximately 1700 to 1879. The first appearance of Caucasians was with the founding of fur trading posts during the 1820s; these trading posts remained operational until the mid-1830s. The first “settlers” of this region were the [[Arikara|Arikara Indians]], but they would later be joined by others.

The first group of Euro-American settlers to reach the area that is now Brown County was a party of only four people, three horses, two mules, fifteen cattle, and two wagons. This group of settlers was later joined by another group the following spring, and eventually more and more settlers migrated towards this general area which is currently [[Columbia, South Dakota]]. This town was established on June 15, 1879. The town was settled in 1880,&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor-first=Dale H. |editor-last=Hoiberg|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica |title=Aberdeen |edition=15th |year=2010|publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica Inc. |volume=I: A-ak Bayes |location=Chicago, IL |isbn=978-1-59339-837-8|pages=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and incorporated in 1882.

The majority of the settlers were Euro-American, with the next largest group being Native American, a trend that has continued to this day.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

===Creation of the town===
[[File:Aberdeen 1883.jpg|thumb|right|1883 illustration of Aberdeen]]
Aberdeen, like many towns of the Midwest, was built around the newly developing railroad systems. Aberdeen was first officially plotted as a town site on January 3, 1881, by Charles Prior, the superintendent of the Minneapolis office of the [[Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad|Chicago, Milwaukee, and St. Paul Railroad]], or the Milwaukee Road for short, which was presided over by [[Alexander Mitchell (politician)|Alexander Mitchell]]. Mitchell, Charles Prior’s boss, was responsible for the choice of town names, was born in [[Aberdeen]], Scotland, after which the town of Aberdeen, South Dakota, was named.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; Aberdeen was officially founded on July 6, 1881, the date of the first arrival of a Milwaukee Railroad train. Aberdeen then operated under a city charter granted by the Territorial Legislature in March, 1883.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

As Aberdeen grew, many businesses and buildings were constructed along Aberdeen’s Main Street. However, this soon became a problem due to Aberdeen’s “unique” geography; Aberdeen is, after all, referred to as “The Town in the Frog Pond”. At first, this unique condition presented no problem to the newly constructed buildings because it had not rained very much; but eventually, citizens would see how inconvenient the problem would become. During dry periods, this Frog Pond caused no trouble and was unnoticeable; but when heavy rains fell, the Pond reappeared and flooded the basements of every building on Main Street, causing many business owners and home owners much turmoil. When this flooding happened, the city had only one little steam pump that had to be used to dry out the entire area that had been flooded, which would take days, if not weeks – and more often than not, it would have rained again in this time period and caused even more flooding, even in the basements that had already been emptied of the water. And then, even once the water was gone from the basements, the city still had to deal with the mud that was also a result of the heavy rains. It was because of this Frog Pond that the city decided in 1882 to build an artesian ditch, which was later upgraded and developed into an artesian well in 1884 to combat the heavy rains and keep the basements from flooding. Even though the artesian well was designed by the city engineers to prevent flooding and develop a water system, this was not how things happened; during the digging of the well, the water stream that was found underground was too powerful to contain due to the built up pressure, which caused the water to come blasting out with violent force and soon had the entire Main Street under, in some cases, four feet of water. The engineers realized the previous flaws of the artesian well plan and soon added a gate valve to the well to control the flow of water, giving Aberdeen its first working water supply.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Aberdeen had four different railroad companies with depots built in the newly developing town. With these four railroads intersecting here, Aberdeen soon became known as the “Hub City of the Dakotas”. When looking down on Aberdeen from above, the railroad tracks converging in Aberdeen resembled the spokes of a wheel converging at a hub, hence the name “Hub City of the Dakotas”. These four railroad companies are the reason why Aberdeen was able to grow and flourish as it did; however, only one of these railroads is still running through Aberdeen, the railroad today known as the Burlington Northern Santa Fe.

==Geography==
Aberdeen is located in northeastern South Dakota, in the [[James River (Dakotas)|James River]] valley, approximately {{convert|11|mi|km|0}} west of the river.

The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration maintains a National Weather Service office in Aberdeen. Their area of responsibility includes northern and eastern South Dakota and two counties in west-central Minnesota.

Aberdeen is the county seat of Brown County. The original county seat was, however, [[Columbia, South Dakota|Columbia]]. During the days of the railroad construction, plans were laid to bring the railroad through Columbia, then the county seat. When word of this spread, land in and around Columbia soared in price due to speculation. When time came for the railroads to purchase land, the increase in land prices led them to change their decision and instead to route the rail lines through Aberdeen. However, once Aberdeen became a town in 1881, there was a long-running controversy concerning which town would be the county seat, which continued until 1890, when it was declared by the newly formed South Dakota state constitution in 1889 that a majority vote could move the county seat if the county seat in question had originally been established by less than a majority vote. The result of the vote declared that Aberdeen would be the county seat once and for all, so all of the records were once again transferred to Aberdeen’s courthouse; during the battle for county seat, the records had been moved from Columbia’s courthouse to Aberdeen’s courthouse (which was built from 1886 to 1887), and back again to Columbia’s in what seemed to be a never-ending cycle of the transferring of records. This was typically done in the form of nighttime raids from the two towns.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

[[File:Roundhouse and other buildings in Lead, South Dakota.jpg|thumb|right|Buildings on Lead's western side]]

'''Lead''' (pronounced &quot;leed&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =  http://www.ap.org/southdakota/prono.html | title = Broadcast Pronunciation Guide and South Dakota Pronunciations | publisher = [[Associated Press]] | accessdate = 2009-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a city in [[Lawrence County, South Dakota|Lawrence County]], [[South Dakota]], [[United States]]. The population was 3,124 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. Lead is located in western [[South Dakota]], in the [[Black Hills]] near the [[Wyoming]] state line.

==History==
The city was officially founded on July 10, 1876, after the discovery of [[gold]]. It is the site of the [[Homestake Mine (South Dakota)|Homestake Mine]], the largest, deepest ({{Convert|8240|ft|m|disp=sqbr}}) and most productive gold mine in the [[Western Hemisphere]] before closing in January 2002.  By 1910, Lead had a population of 8,382, making it the second largest town in South Dakota.&lt;ref&gt;Severson, Trudy. - [http://www.homestaketour.com/history.html &quot;History of the Homestake Gold Mine&quot;]. - Homestake Visitor Center.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lead was originally founded as a company town by the [[Homestake Mining Company]], which ran the nearby Homestake Mine.  [[Phoebe Hearst]], wife of one of the principals, was instrumental in making Lead more livable.  She established the Hearst Free Public Library in town, and in 1900 the Hearst Free Kindergarten. Phoebe Hearst and Thomas Grier, the Homestake Mine superintendent worked together to create the Homestake Opera House and Recreation Center for the benefit of miner workers and their families. Phoebe Hearst donated regularly to Lead's churches, and provided college scholarships to the children of mine and mill workers.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Duane A. - &quot;Here's to low-grade ore and plenty of it, the Hearsts and the Homestake mine&quot;. - ''Mining Engineering''. - September 2003. - p.23-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1930s, due to fear of cave ins of the miles of tunnels under Lead's Homestake Mine, many of the town’s buildings located in the bottom of a canyon were moved further uphill to safer locations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=E-IDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA582&amp;dq=Popular+Science+1933+plane+%22Popular+Mechanics%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=v_wHTomlB6H30gG6tLzMCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true &quot;City Moved to Make Room for a Gold Mine&quot;] April 1933, ''Popular Mechanics''&lt;/ref&gt;

Lead and the Homestake Mine have been selected as the site of the [[Deep Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory]], a proposed NSF facility for low-background experiments on neutrinos, dark matter, and other nuclear physics topics, as well as biology and mine engineering studies.&lt;ref&gt;News: [http://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=109694&amp;org=NSF&amp;from=news &quot;Team Selected for the Proposed Design of the Deep Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory&quot;]. - U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, most of Lead was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] under the name of the &quot;Lead Historic District&quot;. Over four hundred buildings and {{convert|580|acre|ha}} were included in the [[historic district (United States)|historic district]], which has boundaries roughly equivalent to the city limits.&lt;ref name=nris /&gt;

==Geography==
Lead is located at {{coord|44|21|3|N|103|45|57|W|type:city}} (44.350967, -103.765784).{{GR|1}}

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|2.06|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, all of it land.&lt;ref name =&quot;Gazetteer files&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lead has been assigned the [[ZIP code]] 57754 and the [[FIPS place code]] 36220.

Lead's proximity to [[Deadwood, South Dakota]] often leads to the two cities being collectively named &quot;Lead-Deadwood&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

In the summer, there are numerous trails for hiking, mountain biking, and horse back riding. The [[George S. Mickelson Trail]], which runs from Edgemont to Deadwood, runs through the city. Several man made lakes, including [[Sheridan Lake]] provide fishing and swimming. [[Spearfish Canyon]] to the north has many places to rock climb.

During the winter there are two ski areas just a few miles outside of Lead. [[Terry Peak]] and [[Deer Mountain]] are both full service ski areas.

==Gorilla Project==
The [[Dallas]]-based energy firm [http://www.hyperionresources.com/ Hyperion Resources Inc.] announced on June 13, 2007 that area north of Elk Point, near [[Spink, South Dakota|Spink]], was a finalist for a new [[oil refinery]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Announcement&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title =Energy center decision to come in 2008: Hyperion announcement is first step in public process | work =Southern Union County Leader-Courier | page =1,10 | date =2007-06-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The facility, which would process {{convert|400000|oilbbl|m3}} of oil a day and use {{convert|12|e6USgal|m3}} of water daily from the Missouri River, has caused significant controversy among concerned residents of Elk Point and the surrounding area.&lt;ref name=&quot;Announcement&quot; /&gt; Prior to the announcement, the project was kept under considerable secrecy, and was known only as &quot;Project Gorilla&quot; while Hyperion made several purchase agreements on land north and east of Elk Point.&lt;ref name=&quot;Announcement&quot; /&gt; Elk Point is the forerunner among three other out-of-state locations Hyperion is considering for construction of the massive, {{convert|2000|acre|km2|sing=on}} refinery.&lt;ref name=&quot;Announcement&quot; /&gt;

Opponents are concerned about [[Air Pollution|air]], [[Water Pollution|water]], and [[noise pollution]]; environmental degradation of nearby food crops such as [[soy beans]], [[Maize|corn]], and [[alfalfa]]; negative effects on the [[Ethanol|ethanol fuel market]] and competition with local ethanol producing farmers; displacement of some local residents and population resettling; potential [[industrial disasters]] including explosions, leaks, and spills, reminiscent of the recent explosion at a similar-capacity [[Texas City Refinery (BP)|Texas City Oil Refinery]] that caused the deaths of 15 workers and injured over 100; contamination potential threats of [[terrorism]]; and concerns of the sheer size of the facility, which will be over twice the area of Elk Point itself.

Supporters argue that the facility will bring a much-needed economic boost to the Union County area, and would create over 4,500 new construction jobs and employ 1,800 full-time workers once completed. Hyperion representatives have also promised that the corporation would &quot;go the extra mile&quot; to protect the environment.

On October 1, 2012, Hyperion officials confirmed that they had allowed all of their land options for the refinery project in Union County to expire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.ksfy.com/story/19690144/hyperion-allows-union-county-land-leases-to-expire/|title= Hyperion Allows Union County Land Leases to Expire|publisher= KSFY-TV|date =2012.10.01 |accessdate=October 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Summerset''' is a city in [[Meade County, South Dakota|Meade County]], [[South Dakota]], [[United States]]. The population was 1,814 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. Located in the western part of the state, it is the first city to incorporate in the state since 1985.

Summerset was incorporated in an election that was held on June 7, 2005.  Opponents of the city's dissolution insist a population of more than a thousand, despite the formal pre-incorporation census indicating 597 residents.  The city is located west of [[Interstate 90]], between the towns of [[Blackhawk, South Dakota|Blackhawk]] and [[Piedmont, South Dakota]]. The city shares its zip codes of 57718 and 57769 with these two towns.

During its first year, Summerset faced a few challenges.  There was confusion about the location of the city's boundaries.  A lawsuit was filed to dismiss the incorporation election.  And, the citizens petitioned to have the town dissolved for a multitude of reasons, including high taxes; the petition failed.&lt;ref name=petition&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rapidcityjournal.com/articles/2006/09/16/news/top/news03.txt |title=New city avoids election to dissolve | work= [[Rapid City Journal]]| date=September 16, 2006 | accessdate=August 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This issue went to trial on September 14, 2006 in Meade County.  A decision was handed down by the jury in the trial on September 15, 2006 siding with Summerset that there were indeed more than 1000 inhabitants at the time of the vote to incorporate.  The plaintiff, Casey Dolney of Summerset, can appeal the decision to the South Dakota Supreme Court.&lt;ref name=petition/&gt;

is a city in and the [[county seat]] of [[Butte County, South Dakota|Butte County]], [[South Dakota]], [[United States]].{{GR|6}} The population was 5,594 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. Belle Fourche is the site of the [[Geographic center of the United States|geographic center of the fifty United States]] ([[Lebanon, Kansas]] claims the title [[Geographic center of the contiguous United States|for the 48 contiguous states]]).

==History==
Belle Fourche ([[French language|French]] for &quot;beautiful fork&quot;) was named by French explorers when this area was owned by France, for the confluence of what is now known as the Belle Fourche and Redwater Rivers and the Hay Creek. Beaver trappers worked these rivers until the mid-19th century, and Belle Fourche became a well known fur trading rendezvous point. During and after the gold rush of 1876, farmers and ranchers alike settled in the fertile valleys, growing food for the miners and their work animals. At the same time, the open plains for hundred of miles in all directions were being filled by huge herds of Texas and Kansas cattle. Towns sprang up to serve the ever-changing needs of the farmers and ranchers. In 1884, the [[Marquis de Mores]], a French nobleman and contemporary of [[Theodore Roosevelt]], established a stage line between [[Medora, North Dakota]] and [[Deadwood, South Dakota]]. The Belle Fourche way station included a stage barn and a saloon.

[[Image:Belle Fourche.jpg|thumb|Commemorating the geographic center of the fifty states|left]]

Knowing the cattle barons and the railroad would need a point at which to load the herds of cattle onto freight cars for shipment to the packing plants in the midwest, [[Seth Bullock]] provided a solution and became the parent, in effect, of Belle Fourche, the city.  After serving in the Montana legislature in 1871–1873 (and being instrumental in the establishment of a National Park at [[Yellowstone]]), he had come to the Black Hills to cash in selling supplies to the Deadwood miners, arriving August 2, 1876, the day [[Wild Bill Hickok]] was murdered. During the next 14 years, Bullock acquired land as homesteaders along the Belle Fourche River &quot;proved up&quot; and sold out. When the railroad came to the Hills and refused to pay the prices demanded by nearby township of [[Minnesela]], he was ready. Seth offered the railroad free right-of-way and offered to build the terminal if the railroad would locate it at a point on his land near where the present Belle Fourche Livestock Exchange exists. In 1890, the first train load of cattle headed east. By 1895, Belle Fourche was shipping 2500 carloads of cattle per month in the peak season, making it the world's largest livestock shipping point. This was the start of the agriculture center of the Tri-State area for which Belle Fourche would become known.

After winning a competition with Minnesela over the railroad which now goes through Belle Fourche, Bullock's town went on to win the county seat in the election of 1894; still, cowboys rode into Minnesela and stole the county books.
 
Belle Fourche today serves a large trade area of ranches and farms. The wool, cattle, and [[bentonite]] industries have been important to the growth of Belle Fourche. Belle Fourche serves gateway to the Northern Black Hills.&lt;ref&gt;Information was taken from the Belle Fourche America's Hometown Booklet (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

== &quot;Center of the Nation&quot; ==
In 1959, the [[U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey]] officially designated a point 20 miles north of Belle Fourche as the [[geographic center of the United States]]. It is the center of the nation because the admission of [[Alaska]] and [[Hawaii]] to the United States moved the location of the official center of the nation.

==Geography==
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|8.60|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which, {{convert|8.53|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.07|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.&lt;ref name =&quot;Gazetteer files&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hill City''' is the oldest existing city in [[Pennington County, South Dakota|Pennington County]], [[South Dakota]], [[United States]].  The population was 948 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. Hill City is located {{convert|26|mi|km}} southwest of [[Rapid City, South Dakota|Rapid City]] on [[South Dakota Highway 16|State Highway 16]] and on [[U.S. Route 385]] that connects [[Deadwood, South Dakota|Deadwood]] to [[Hot Springs, South Dakota|Hot Springs]]. Hill City is known as the &quot;Heart of the Hills&quot; which is derived from its close proximity to both the geographical center of the [[Black Hills]], and the local tourist destinations.

The city has its roots in the Black Hills mining rush of the late 19th century. Tin mining was dominant in the 1880s and led to an influx of capital and people into the area. As the mining industry subsequently waned, tourism and timber became increasingly important to the area. With the establishment of [[Mount Rushmore]] in the 1940s, [[Custer State Park]], and the [[Sturgis Motorcycle Rally]], the Black Hills became known as a tourist destination which Hill City benefited from. In recent years the city has diversified to become a center for the arts in the area featuring several art studios and festivals.&lt;ref name=&quot;bhvisitor&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blackhillsvisitor.com/main.asp?id=14&amp;cat_id=30020|title=Hill City|accessdate=2007-05-20 |last= |first= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |work= Black Hills Visitor Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Human history in the area that became Hill City, and the greater Black Hills in particular, started by at least 7000 B.C. The [[Arikara]] arrived by 1500 A. D., followed by the [[Cheyenne]], [[Crow Nation|Crow]], [[Kiowa]] and [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]]. In the 19th century the [[Lakota people|Lakota]] [[Sioux]] claimed the land calling it ''Paha Sapa''. In 1874 Major General [[George Armstrong Custer]] led an expedition into the Black Hills during which gold was discovered in French Creek, {{convert|13|mi|km}} south of Hill City. The discovery of gold opened the Black Hills, and the Hill City area, to mining. Hill City was first settled by miners in 1876 who referred to the area as Hillyo. This was the second American settlement in the Black Hills.&lt;ref name=&quot;second city&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usacitiesonline.com/sdcountyhillcity.htm|title=Hill City|accessdate=2007-05-28 |work= Key to the City}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hill City is the oldest city still in existence in Pennington County.&lt;ref name=&quot;oldest city&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blackhillsdiscovered.com/articles/2006/10/13/historic/hillcity01.txt|title=Hill City|accessdate=2007-05-28 |last= Pechan|first=Bev |work= Black Hills Discovered}}&lt;/ref&gt; A post office was constructed and opened on November 26, 1877.&lt;ref name=&quot;sdtown&quot;&gt;http://www.sdhistory.org/arc/sdtowns.htm Retrieved on May 26, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  The city almost reverted into a [[ghost town]] when miners relocated to the northern Black Hills after the discovery of gold there.

However, in 1883, [[tin]] was discovered near town and the population rebounded. The Harney Peak Tin Mining, Milling, and Manufacturing Company made its headquarters on Main Street along with at one time 15 saloons. The company was backed by English financiers and bought 1100 prospecting sites around the area. As mining grew, the city became known for its wild living and was once referred to as, &quot; a town with a church on each end and a mile of Hell in between.&quot;  The company built the [[Harney Peak Hotel]] on Main Street to entertain its management and executives. Upon realizing the market in Tin was unsustainable, the company ceased operation in 1902.

Although a small school building was established previously, a main school building was constructed on Main Street in 1921. This school building was replaced in 2001 with the current high school. On July 10, 1939 a fire started ten miles (16&amp;nbsp;km) outside of Hill City. Among those who battled the blaze was Hill City High School's entire basketball squad, as well as several teachers and administrators. US forest service named the school boys one of the best crews who fought the fire. The school team name thus became the Hill City Rangers and was privileged as the only school district in the United States allowed to use [[Smokey Bear]] as its official mascot.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hillcity.k12.sd.us/ The Story of the Hill City School Mascot, Retrieved on June 8, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; Hill City was incorporated on March 21, 1945.&lt;ref name=&quot;sdtown&quot;/&gt; The Harney Peak Hotel remained in operation until 1934. The Building has been restored and is the current location of the Alpine Inn. This building is on the [[List of Registered Historic Places in South Dakota]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bhvisitor&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;keyhist&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.keystonechamber.com/kahs/keyhistory.html|title=A Thumbnail History of Keystone|accessdate=2007-05-22 |last= Robert|first=Hayes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;alpine inn&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alpineinnhillcity.com/about.asp|title=Alpine Inn Hill City|accessdate=2007-05-22 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070206210915/http://www.alpineinnhillcity.com/about.asp &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Black Hills Institute of Geological Research opened in 1973 and is involved in excavation and display of dinosaur and other fossils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Black Hills Institute of Geological Research | year =2005 | url =http://www.bhigr.com | accessdate =2007-12-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1992 the institute was engaged in a legal battle over ownership of ''[[Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' fossil named &quot;Sue&quot;.

This city was one of the filming locations for [[Turner Network Television|TNT]]'s 1994 film ''[[Lakota Woman: Siege at Wounded Knee]]''.

===Railroad===
[[File:BHC RR in 2001.jpg|thumb|270px|A [[Black Hills Central Railroad]] train steams out of Hill City in 2001, bound for [[Keystone, South Dakota]]]]
The main railroad lines that intersected Hill City are the [[Burlington Northern]] Line (also called the High line), previously the Grand Island and Wyoming Central, operated by the [[Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad]] Company, and the Black Hills central line a spur that extended from Hill City to Keystone. The Northern line extended from [[Edgemont, South Dakota|Edgemont]] north through Hill City and terminated in Deadwood. Hill City was reached by this line in 1893, and the central line was extended to [[Keystone, South Dakota|Keystone]] and reached there on January 20, 1900.&lt;ref name=&quot;keyhist&quot;/&gt; [[Narrow gauge]] trolley cars were operated at 45 minute intervals during the day on the northern line. The Northern line was discontinued for passenger service in 1949, and was fully abandoned in 1983. It is now the [[George S. Mickelson Trail]] after being converted to a bike trail during the 1990s.

In 1957 the [[Black Hills Central Railroad]], also known locally as the 1880 train, opened a tourist passenger train on the central line. In 1972 a flood destroyed the last mile of the Burlington Northern/Black Hills Central line that extended from Hill City to Keystone. This final mile was restored in 2001. The Black Hills Central Railroad restores era style locomotives and train cars, and has been featured on the television shows, [[Gunsmoke]] episode Snow Train, [[General Hospital]] and the TV mini-series, [[Into the West (TV miniseries)|Into the West]] produced by TNT. The railroad also made an appearance in the movie, Orphan Train.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =Railroad History of the Black Hills | work = | publisher =Roosevelt Inn | year =1999 | url =http://www.rosyinn.com/5600a04.htm | doi = | accessdate =2007-12-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Mills | first =Rick | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =A Time Line of Black Hills Railroads | work =Black Hills Visitor Magazine | publisher = | date = | url =http://www.blackhillsvisitor.com/main.asp?id=14&amp;cat_id=30175&amp;open_id=71 | format = | doi = | accessdate =2007-12-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =Black Hills 1880 Central Railroad Train | work =ALLBlackHills.com | publisher =Vertical Media | date = | url =http://www.allblackhills.com/attractions/black_hills_1880_central_railroad_train.php | format = | doi = | accessdate =2007-12-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sue controversy===
On August 12, 1990, [[Sue Hendrickson]], an American [[paleontologist]] working for the [[Black Hills Institute of Geological Research, Inc.|Black Hills Institute of Geological Research]] discovered the fossil of what would become the most complete skeleton of a ''Tyrannosaurus Rex'' ever discovered. The fossil was named &quot;[[Sue (dinosaur)|Sue]]&quot; after the woman who discovered it. After discovery, excavation, and transport to the Institute's facilities in Hill City, controversy arose as to who the rightful owners of the fossil was. The parties in dispute were the land owner, Maurice Williams, the tribe - and thus the federal government, and the Black Hills Institute.  On May 12, 1992  FBI agents seized Sue from the Institute over the course of three days. The fossil was shipped to [[South Dakota School of Mines and Technology]]. Through the ongoing court battle it was finally decided that Maurice Williams was the owner of the fossil. The federal government later brought a 39 count 153 charge indictment against the institute and several of its members which was related to this case and other fossils. This case turned into the longest criminal trial in South Dakota state history. Finally [[Peter Larson]] the president of the institute was convicted on two counts of customs violations for which he served two years in federal prison. Sue was finally auctioned off by [[Sotheby's]] auction house, and sold by Maurice Williams to the [[Field Museum]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]] for 8.36 million dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Larson | first =Neal | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =The Story of a Dinosaur Named SUE | work = | publisher =Black Hills Institute of Geological Research | date =May 18, 2000 | url =http://www.bhigr.com/pages/info/info_sue_6.htm | doi = | accessdate =2007-12-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable events==
Carthage gained a small amount of attention when it was featured in the book ''[[Into the Wild (book)|Into the Wild]]'' by [[Jon Krakauer]]. The book documents the travels of [[Christopher McCandless|Chris McCandless]], who along the way took a job at a grain elevator in the community in September 1990 and April 1992.

'''Vermillion''' is a city in and the [[county seat]] of [[Clay County, South Dakota|Clay County]],{{GR|6}} in the southeastern corner of the [[U.S. state|State]] of [[South Dakota]], and the tenth largest city in the state. According to the [[2010 United States Census|2010 Census]], the population was 10,571. Vermillion lies atop a bluff near the [[Missouri River]].   

The area has been home to various Native American tribes for centuries. French fur traders first visited in the late 18th century.  Vermillion was founded in 1859 and incorporated in 1873. The name refers to the Lakota name: ''wa sa wak pa'la'' (red stream).

Home to the [[University of South Dakota]], Vermillion has a mixed academic and rural character: The university is a major academic institution for the state, boasting the state's only law and medical school, and the state's only AACSB accredited business school. Major farm products include corn, soybeans, and alfalfa.

Vermillion is located approximately {{convert|10|mi}} from the proposed site of a Hyperion oil refinery (formerly known as the [[Gorilla Project]]).

==History==
[[Lewis and Clark]] camped at the mouth of the Vermillion River near the present-day town on Friday, August 24, 1804. (The previous day they killed their first bison and the following day they climbed Spirit Mound, according to Clark's journal.)

* In May 1843 [[John James Audubon]] visited the Vermillion ravine to view the bird life.

* The town was considered for the location of South Dakota's first [[Psychiatric hospital|mental institution]], (now the [[Human Services Center]]) in 1873, although the hospital was eventually located in nearby [[Yankton, South Dakota|Yankton]].

* The original town was entirely located below the bluffs on the banks of the [[Missouri River]], and three-quarters of the town was washed away in the great flood of 1881.

* Presidential candidates [[William Jennings Bryan]] visited and spoke in Vermillion on September 28, 1908, and [[William Howard Taft]] on the next day.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

* [[John Philip Sousa]] conducted the Sousa Band on October 26, 1926 at the facility that became known as Slagle Auditorium in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Edmund Bierley, ''The Incredible Band of John Philip Sousa'' (Urbana:  University of Illinois Press, 2006), p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

* On March 24, 1967, Thomas James White Hawk and William Stands murdered the Vermillion jeweler James Yeado and raped his wife.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Vizenor, &quot;Thomas James White Hawk: Murder on Good Friday,&quot; and &quot;Commutation of Death&quot;, in ''Tribal Scenes and Ceremonies,'' Minneapolis: Nodin Press, c. 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Donald Opperman's car parked illegally on the streets on December 10, 1973 leads to the U.S. Supreme Court case ''[[South Dakota v. Opperman]]'', decided March 29, 1976.{{Citation needed|reason=needs footnote. also a bit more explanation of why this was important|date=January 2010}}

Vermillion operates under the [[council-manager]] form of government. Vermillion's governing body is made up of nine members. Eight City Council members are elected from four wards, with two members representing each ward. The Mayor is elected at-large and presides over City Council meetings.  The mayor may vote on all matters coming before the governing body. With the consent of the City Council, the Mayor appoints individuals to serve on the Library Board and Planning Commission.  The Library Board oversees the operations of the Vermillion Public Library and appoints a Library Director.  All services and programs provided by the library are overseen by the board.  The Planning Commission is charged with overseeing the long-range planning of the community, including zoning issues, subdivisions and formulation of the Comprehensive Plan.  The Planning Commission serves a vital role in recommending major policy changes to the governing body for the development of the community.

[[Image:Petrified Wood Park in Lemmon, South Dakota.jpg|right|thumbnail]] Lemmon is home to the world’s largest Petrified Wood Park. This tourist attraction fills an entire block of the downtown area and is built entirely of petrified wood, fossils and stone. Construction began in 1930 and continued until 1932 under the supervision of Ole S. Quammen. It was in private ownership until 1954 when it was donated to the city by Quammen's heirs. The park features a wishing well, a waterfall, and a castle.  The castle weighs 300 tons and boasts towering spires and turrets.  Also in the park are two separate museums, both built entirely of petrified wood. The larger of the two is circular has a petrified grass floor along with petrified logs. Dinosaur claws, bird tracks and fossilized snakes can be seen in the petrified wood. Also in the museum are antiques and artifacts from the Lemmon area. The formations in the park number over 100 and are up to 20 feet tall.

The Boss Cowman Rodeo and Celebration is the second weekend in July, and is one of the largest rodeos in the state.

The Grand River Museum is located on Highway 12.  The Museum features exhibits on creation science, fossils, Native Americans, cowboys and ranch life, a full-scale tipi and a model of the Ark.  Admission is free.

Lemmon has a 9-hole golf course, an airport, two convenience stores, a Ben Franklin variety store, a hardware store, a grocery store, an American Legion, and many other businesses. It is home to the Powderhorn family restaurant, the Sugar Shack, the Alaska Cafe, Benny's steakhouse, the R bar, and the Chinese Garden. Lemmon also has 7 churches, 3 financial institutions, a library, a movie theater, a clinic, a nursing home, an eye clinic, a dentistry office, and a veterinarian clinic.  There are also 3 hotels in town, the Dakota Lodge, the Lemmon Country Inn, and the In Town Motel.  The Lemmon Sale Barn is just to the west of town, with sales every Wednesday.

Many Lemmonites are employed at Wheeler's Manufacturing, which produces jewelry products.  Gregorian, Inc., and Dakota Woodcrafts also employ manufacturing workers.  Other major employers are the school system and ranches.

==Government==
The mayor of Lemmon is Neal Pinnow, who was elected in April 2008 to replace outgoing mayor Wally Dauwen.  The city council has eight members.  There is a three man police department and one Perkins County Deputy, along with a SD Highway Patrolman stationed in Lemmon and a 30 man volunteer fire department.

==Education==
Lemmon's school district includes a high school and an elementary school.  The Progress country school operated in Meadow until the summer of 2010, when it was destroyed by a [[tornado]].  The small rural school district was then consolidated into the Lemmon and Faith districts.

Founded in 1880 on the [[Missouri River]] opposite [[Fort Pierre, South Dakota|Fort Pierre]], Pierre has been the capital since South Dakota gained [[U.S. state|statehood]] on November 2, 1889, having been chosen for its location in the geographic center of the state. Fort Pierre itself was named after [[Pierre Chouteau, Jr.]], an American fur trader of [[French people|French]] origin.

Pierre is the principal city of the [[Pierre micropolitan area|Pierre Micropolitan Statistical Area]], which includes all of Hughes and [[Stanley County, South Dakota|Stanley]] counties.

==Geography==
[[File:Pierre South Dakota.jpg|thumb|left|Photo of the [[Oahe Dam]], several miles north of Pierre, taken from the International Space Station (ISS)]]

Pierre is located at {{coord|44|22|5|N|100|20|11|W|type:city}} (44.367966, −100.336378).{{GR|1}}

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|13.07|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which, {{convert|13.06|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.01|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.&lt;ref name =&quot;Gazetteer files&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pierre lies on rough river bluffs overlooking the Missouri River. It is a few miles away from [[Lake Oahe]], one of the largest man made lakes in the world and a very popular [[fishing]] destination.

Pierre has a relatively dry, four-season, [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Dfa''),&lt;ref&gt;Peel, M. C., Finlayson, B. L., and McMahon, T. A.: [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/Americas_Koppen_Map.png Updated American map of the  Köppen-Geiger climate classification.] Earth Syst. Sci., 11, 1633–1644, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; with long, dry, cold winters, hot summers, and brief spring and autumnal transitions; as with much of the southern half of the state, it lies in [[Hardiness zone|USDA Plant Hardiness Zone]] 5.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arborday.org/treeinfo/ZoneInfo.cfm?ZipCode=57501&amp;submit=Look+it+up%21]&lt;/ref&gt; The monthly daily average temperature ranges from {{convert|19.9|°F|1}} in January to {{convert|75.4|°F|1}}, though the [[diurnal temperature variation]] is significantly greater during summer than in winter. Snow primarily falls in light amounts, with the snowiest months being February and March, while the average seasonal total is {{convert|32|in|cm|0}}. In addition, there are 20 nights per year with subzero (≤ −18 °C) lows,&lt;ref name = &quot;NOAA txt&quot;/&gt; and cold conditions are often intensified by the high winds of the Great Plains. Summers often see spikes in temperature, with 6.4 days of {{convert|100|°F|0}}+ highs and 36−37 days of {{convert|90|°F|0}}+ highs.&lt;ref name = &quot;NOAA txt&quot;/&gt;

The beginning of both May and October represent the last and first, respectively, freezing nights of the cooler season.&lt;ref name = &quot;NOAA txt&quot;/&gt; Precipitation is much lighter in the winter months than it is in late spring and summer, and totals about {{convert|20|in|0}} annually. Extremes have ranged from {{convert|−35|°F|0}} on February 9, 1994 to {{convert|117|°F|0}} on July 15, 2006.

'''Rapid City''' is the second-largest city in the [[U.S. state|State]] of [[South Dakota]], and the [[county seat]] of [[Pennington County, South Dakota|Pennington County]].{{GR|6}} Named after [[Rapid Creek (South Dakota)|Rapid Creek]] on which the city is established, it is set against the eastern slope of the [[Black Hills]] mountain range. The town is called Fast Water Mni Luzahan by the American Indian, [[Lakota]] people who have inhabited the lands long before the Western Culture perpetrated genocide. This majority of the homeless and those living below the poverty line are American Indians, the Lakota people in Rapid City and the surrounding areas. The population was 67,956 as of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 Census]].&lt;ref name=&quot;2010 Census (City)&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=2010 Census Redistricting Data (Public Law 94-171) Summary File|url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=DEC_10_PL_GCTPL2.ST13&amp;prodType=table|work=American FactFinder|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=26 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rapid City is known as the &quot;Gateway to the Black Hills&quot; and the &quot;City of Presidents&quot;.  The city is divided by a mountain range that splits the western and eastern parts of the city into two. Ellsworth Air Force Base located on the outskirts of the city. United States Army National Guard, Camp Rapid is located in West Rapid. In the nearby towns are Custer alongside Custer State Park, the Historic old west town of [[Deadwood, South Dakota|Deadwood]] is nearby. In the hills nearby [[Mount Rushmore]] and [[Crazy Horse Memorial]] are located.

==History==
[[File:6th and Main Streets, Rapid City.jpg|thumb|left|400px|Panoramic view of Sixth and Main Streets in Rapid City, ca. 1912]]
The public discovery of [[gold]] in 1874 by the [[George Armstrong Custer|Custer]] Expedition brought a mass influx of settlers into the [[Black Hills]] region of [[South Dakota]]. Rapid City was founded (and originally known as &quot;Hay Camp&quot;) in 1876 by a group of disappointed miners, who promoted their new city as the &quot;Gateway to the Black Hills.&quot; John Brennan and Samuel Scott, with a small group of men, laid out the site of the present Rapid City in February 1876, which was named for the spring-fed [[Rapid Creek (South Dakota)|Rapid Creek]] that flows through it. A square mile was measured off and the six blocks in the center were designated as a business section. Committees were appointed to bring in prospective merchants and their families to locate in the new settlement. The city soon began selling supplies to miners and pioneers. Its location on the edge of the Plains and Hills and its large river valley made it the natural hub of railroads arriving in the late 1880s from both the south and east. By 1900, Rapid City had survived a boom and bust and was establishing itself as an important regional trade center for the upper midwest.

Although the Black Hills became a popular tourist destination in the late 1890s, it was a combination of local efforts, the popularity of the automobile, and construction of improved highways that brought tourists to the [[Black Hills]] in large numbers after World War I. [[Gutzon Borglum]], already a famous sculptor, began work on [[Mount Rushmore]] in 1927 and his son, Lincoln Borglum, continued the carving of the presidents' faces in rock following his father's death in 1941. The work was halted due to pressures leading to the US entry into World War II and the massive sculpture was declared complete in 1941. Although tourism sustained the city throughout the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, the gasoline rationing of [[World War II]] had a devastating effect on the tourist industry in the town, but this was more than made up for by the war-related growth.

The city benefited greatly from the opening of Rapid City Army Air Base, later [[Ellsworth Air Force Base]], an [[United States Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]] training base. As a result, the population of the area nearly doubled between 1940 and 1948, from almost 14,000 to nearly 27,000 people. Military families and civilian personnel soon took every available living space in town, and mobile parks proliferated. Rapid City businesses profited from the military payroll.
During the Cold War, missile installations proliferated in the area: a series of Nike Air Defense sites were constructed around Ellsworth in the 1950s. In the early 60s the construction of three [[Titan (rocket family)|Titan missile]] launch sites containing a total of nine Titan I missiles in the general vicinity of Rapid City took place.  Beginning in November 1963, the land for a hundred miles east, northeast and northwest of the city was dotted with 150 [[Minuteman]] [[missile silo]]s and 15 launch command centers, all of which were deactivated in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =The Brookings Institution | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =Retiring a Minuteman ICBM (LGM-30F) | work =U.S. Nuclear Weapons Cost Study Project | publisher = | date = | url =http://www.brook.edu/fp/projects/nucwcost/retire.htm | doi = | accessdate =2007-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949, city officials envisioned the city as a retail and wholesale trade center for the region and designed a plan for growth that focused on a civic center, more downtown parking places, new schools, and paved streets. A construction boom continued into the 1950s. Growth slowed in the 1960s, but the worst natural disaster in South Dakota history, the Black Hills Flood led to another building boom a decade later. On June 9, 1972, heavy rains caused massive flooding of the Rapid Creek. More than 250 people lost their lives and more than $100 million in property was destroyed.
[[Image:Rapidcreek1972flood.jpg|thumb|right|Debris along Rapid Creek after 1972 flood.]]

The devastation of the flood and the outpouring of private donations and millions of dollars in federal aid led to the completion of one big part of the 1979 plan: clearing the area along the Rapid Creek and making it a public park. New homes and businesses were constructed to replace those that had been destroyed. [[Rushmore Plaza Civic Center]] and a new [http://www1.rcas.org/chs Central High School] were built in part of the area that had been cleared. The new Central High School opened in 1978, with the graduating class in that year straddling both the original Central (housed in what is now Dakota Middle School) and the new Central.  The rebuilding in part insulated Rapid City from the drop in automotive tourism caused by the Oil Embargo in 1974, but tourism was depressed for most of a decade. In 1978, [[Rushmore Mall]] was built on the north edge of the city, adding to the city's position as a retail shopping center.

In 1980 in ''[[United States v. Sioux Nation of Indians]]'', the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled that the [[government of the United States]] had illegally stolen the [[Black Hills]] from the [[Sioux]] people when the government unilaterally broke the treaty that guaranteed the Black Hills belonged to the Sioux. The court decision offered money, but the Sioux declined on principle that the theft of their land should not be validated, and still demand the return of the land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Giago | first =Tim | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =The Black Hills: A Case of Dishonest Dealings |work=| publisher =The Huffington Post | date =2007-06-03 | url =http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tim-giago/the-black-hills-a-case-o_b_50480.html | doi = | accessdate =2007-10-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This land includes Rapid City, which is by far the largest modern settlement in the Black Hills.  As of 2010, the dispute has not been settled.

In the 1980s, growth was fueled by an increase in tourism, increasingly tied to the [[Sturgis Motorcycle Rally]], followed by another decline in the late 1990s.  Fears for the closure of Ellsworth AFB as part of the massive base closure process in the 1990s and 2000s led to attempts to expand other sectors of the economy, but growth continued and the city expanded significantly during this period.

Today, Rapid City is South Dakota's primary city for tourism and recreation. With the approval of a [[Deep Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory]] at the [[Homestake Mine (South Dakota)|Homestake Mine]] site in nearby [[Lead, South Dakota|Lead]], Rapid City has a future of great advancements in [[technology]], [[medicine]], and [[scientific research]].

===1972 Rapid Creek Flood===
{{Main|Black Hills flood}}
[[Image:Rapid City SD wea00703.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Cars jumbled together by the 1972 flood.]]

On June 9–10, 1972, extremely heavy rains over the eastern [[Black Hills]] of [[South Dakota]] produced record floods on [[Rapid Creek (South Dakota)|Rapid Creek]] and other streams in the area. Nearly {{convert|15|in|mm}} of rain fell in about 6 hours near [[Nemo, South Dakota|Nemo]], and more than {{convert|10|in|mm}} of rain fell over an area of {{convert|60|sqmi|km2|-1}}. According to the [[Red Cross]], the resulting peak floods (which occurred after dark) left 238 people dead and 3,057 people injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The 1972 Black Hills-Rapid City Flood Revisited | publisher = United States Geological Survey | accessdate = 2007-10-15 | url = http://sd.water.usgs.gov/projects/1972flood/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the human tragedy, total damage was estimated in excess of $160 million (about $821 million in 2009 dollars), which included 1,335 homes and 5,000 automobiles that were destroyed. Runoff from this storm produced record floods (highest peak flows recorded) along Battle, Spring, Rapid, and Box Elder Creeks. Smaller floods also occurred along Elk Creek and [[Bear Butte]] Creek. Canyon Lake Dam, on the west side of Rapid City, broke the night of the flood, unleashing a wall of water down the creek. The 1972 flooding has an estimated recurrence interval of 500 years,&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/pubs/ofr/ofr96202 (Burr and Korkow, 1996)]&lt;/ref&gt; which means that a flood of this magnitude will occur on average once every 500 years. Every year there is a 0.2 percent chance (1 in 500) of experiencing a similar event. To prevent a similar tragedy from occurring in the future, the city's flood plain is no longer allowed to be built upon.  Today the flood plain features golf courses, parks, sports arenas, and arboretums where neighborhoods and businesses once stood.

In 2007, the [[Rapid City Public Library]] created a [http://www.rapidcitylibrary.org/lib_info/1972Flood/index.asp 1972 Flood digital archive] that collects survivors' stories, photos and news accounts of the flood. The Journey Museum has an interactive display on the 1972 flood which is an ongoing project to give future generations the best idea of how the people were affected and the changes made to it because of the loss of 238 lives. It will in the future include the biographies of all of those who died so they will be remembered as more than names on a memorial.

==Geography==
Rapid City is located at {{Coord|44.076188|-103.228299|region:US-SD_type:city}}. The downtown elevation of Rapid City is 3,202 feet (976 m) and Rapid City sits in the shadow of [[Harney Peak]]; which at {{convert|7242|ft|m|0}}, is the highest point east of the [[Rocky Mountains]].

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 55.49 square miles (143.71&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), of which, 55.41 square miles (143.5&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of it is land and 0.08 square miles (0.2&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) is water.&lt;ref name=AFgeo&gt;{{cite American Factfinder2|2|46103|county|name=Pennington County}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rapid City is located on the eastern edge of the Black Hills, and is split in half by the Dakota Hogback.  Rapid City's &quot;Westside&quot; is located in the Red Valley between the foothills of the Black Hills proper and the Dakota Hogback, so named for the red Spearfish formation soils and the way the valley completely circles the Black Hills. Rapid City has grown up into the foothills, with both ridges and valleys developed, especially in the last 20 years, and wildfire is a distinct threat to these residential areas, as shown by the Westberry Trails fire in 1988.

Skyline Drive follows the summits of the Dakota Hogback south from near Rapid Gap (where Rapid Creek cuts through the Hogback) to a large high plateau which forms the current south edge of Rapid City. The Central and Eastern portions of Rapid City lie in the wide valley of Rapid Creek outside the Hogback, which includes a number of mesas rising a hundred feet or more above the floodplain.

===Rapid Creek===
Rapid Creek flows through Rapid City, emerging from Dark Canyon above Canyon Lake and flowing in a large arc north of Downtown. Rapid Creek descends to the southeast as the valley widens. The floodplain of Rapid Creek is mostly a series of parks, arboretums, and bike trails, one legacy of the [[Black Hills flood|Black Hills Flood]] of 1972. To the north, a series of ridges separates Rapid Creek from Box Elder Creek, with large older and new residential areas and commercial areas along [[I-90]]. To the south, the terrain rises more steeply to the southern widening of the Dakota Hogback into a plateau dividing the Rapid Creek drainage from Spring Creek.

===Climate===
[[File:Rapid City from Rapid Valley 090604.jpg|thumb|View of southern Rapid City from the east after a rainstorm, including a view of [[Harney Peak]] and the [[Black Hills]].]]

Rapid City features a [[semi-arid climate|steppe climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''BSk''). Its location makes its climate unlike both the higher elevations of the Black Hills and the Great Plains to the east. It is characterized by long arid summers and long dry winters, with short but distinct spring and autumn seasons.

Winters are cold and dry, with December, with a daily average temperature of {{convert|24.9|°F|1}}, being the coldest month in recent years; however, [[Chinook winds]] can warm temperatures above {{convert|50|°F}}, doing so on average about 20 times from December to February.&lt;ref name = &quot;NOAA txt&quot;/&gt; Temperature inversions, however, occasionally produce warmer temperatures in the Black Hills. The low temperature reaches {{convert|0|°F|1}} on an average 16 nights.&lt;ref name = &quot;NOAA txt&quot;/&gt; Snowfall is frequent but usually not heavy; March and April are typically the snowiest months, and the seasonal total averages {{convert|41|in|cm|0}}.&lt;ref name = &quot;NOAA txt&quot;/&gt; Extensive snow cover does not remain for long, with only 9 days per year of {{convert|5|in|cm|0}} or more on the ground.&lt;ref name = &quot;NOAA txt&quot;/&gt;

Compared to locations in the east, spring warms rather gradually, with snow activity ''generally'' ceasing by May and precipitation totals beginning to increase. In the latter half of spring, storms typically develop over the Black Hills during the afternoon and move onto the plains in the evening. However, Rapid City still sees an average of 20 clear to partly cloudy days and 65 percent of its possible sunshine in June.&lt;ref name=Weatherbase&gt;{{cite web

|language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the traditional &quot;flood&quot; season for Rapid and other creeks in the Eastern Hills. Temperatures warm rapidly as summer approaches.

Summer in Rapid City is hot, relatively dry, and sunny. July is the warmest month of the year, having a daily average temperature of {{convert|72.6|°F|1}}. There is an average of 31 days with {{convert|90|°F|0}}+ highs and 4.5 with {{convert|100|°F|0}}+ highs.&lt;ref name = &quot;NOAA txt&quot;/&gt; Due to the elevation and aridity, lows rarely remain at or above {{convert|70|°F|0}} and during summer occasionally lower to {{convert|50|°F}}. Rapid City records an average of 9 thunderstorm days in August,&lt;ref name = Weatherbase /&gt; but only {{convert|1.56|in|mm}} of rain in that month.

Fall is a precipitous transition season, with the average first freeze in Rapid City is October 4 and late August through September in the Black Hills. The Rapid City area's first snowfall is usually in October, although higher elevations sometimes receive significant snow in September. Occasional cold fronts moving through the area bring blustery northwest winds.

Sunshine is abundant in the region, averaging 2850 hours, 65% of the possible total, per year.&lt;ref name = HKO /&gt;

Rapid City holds a record for an extreme temperature drop of {{convert|47|F-change}} in 5 minutes on January 10, 1911.&lt;ref name=&quot;Handy Weather Answer Book&quot;&gt;{{cite book

==Industry and economy==
Rapid City's economy is diverse, but has only a moderate amount of industry.  Heavy and medium industrial activities include a [[Portland cement]] plant (constructed and owned for 84 years&lt;ref&gt;Created by SD Constitutional Amendment, 1919.&lt;/ref&gt; by the State of [[South Dakota]] and sold in 2003 to [[Grupo Cementos de Chihuahua|GCC]], a Mexican-based conglomerate), [[Black Hills Ammunition]] an ammunition and reloading supplies manufacturing company, several custom sawmills, a lime plant, a computer peripheral component manufacturing plant, and several farm and ranch equipment manufacturers.  Of particular note, Rapid City is the center for the manufacture of [[Black Hills gold jewelry]], a popular product with tourists and Westerners in general.  Rapid City is also the location of the only manufacturer of stamping machines used for the labeling of plywood and chipboard products.

Although most gold mining has ceased in the Black Hills and was never done in or near Rapid City, mining of sand and gravel, as well as the raw materials for [[Lime (mineral)|lime]] and Portland cement (including chemical-grade [[limestone]], taconite iron ore, and gypsum) remains an important part of the economy.

The largest sector of the Rapid City economy is government services, including local, state, and federal.  Major employers include [[Ellsworth Air Force Base]],&lt;ref name=Economy&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =Rapid City: Economy | work =City-Data.com | publisher = | date = | url =http://www.city-data.com/us-cities/The-Midwest/Rapid-City-Economy.html | accessdate =2008-10-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; home of the [[28th Bomb Wing]] flying the [[B-1B]] long-range bomber; the [[Army National Guard]] based at [[Camp Rapid]] and hosting annual exercises in the Black Hills drawing troops from five to ten states; and various federal agencies including the [[National Park Service]], [[United States Forest Service|US Forest Service]], and [[Indian Health Service]].

The [[Rapid City Regional Hospital]] Healthcare System covers one of the largest expansions of territory in the United States. The health care sector employs over 8,000 persons in the Rapid City area.&lt;ref name=Economy/&gt;

Tourism is also a major portion of the Rapid City economy,&lt;ref name=Economy/&gt; due to the proximity of [[Mount Rushmore]], Sturgis, home of the [[Sturgis Motorcycle Rally]], [[Deadwood, South Dakota|Deadwood]], and other attractions in the Black Hills.  Rapid City is the major source of services for the Motorcycle Rally, and the Rally's demand for motel rooms, camp sites, and other services for tourists during the first week of August means that Rapid City has the capacity to host large conventions and large numbers of tourists year-round.  Various minor tourist attractions, including wildlife parks, specialty shops, caves, water parks, private museums, and other businesses are found in and near Rapid City.

Other economic sectors include financial service and investing companies such as [[Waddell and Reed]], [[Citibank]], [[WaMu]], [[Merrill Lynch]], and [[Northwestern Mutual]]. Rapid City is the headquarters for [[Assurant]] Insurance's pre-need division and Rapid City has a strong medical services sector, and institutions of higher education.  Rapid City is also the major market town for much of five states, drawing commerce from more than half of South Dakota, and large portions of [[North Dakota]], [[Montana]], [[Wyoming]], and the [[Nebraska Panhandle]].

==Transportation==
Rapid City is a major transportation hub for the Northern Plains. [[Rapid City Regional Airport]] provides flights to the airline hub cities of [[Denver]], [[Minneapolis]], [[Salt Lake City]], [[Dallas-Fort Worth]], [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]/Mesa and  [[Chicago]]. The airport also has extensive [[General Aviation]] operations, including wildfire fighting activities and medical flight support to Rapid City medical facilities and Indian Health Service operations in the Dakotas.

Historically, Rapid City was served by three railroads. Presently, the city is served by the [[Dakota, Minnesota and Eastern Railroad]] (DM&amp;E), now owned by the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]. The DM&amp;E serves the Northern Black Hills and heads south into Nebraska. DM&amp;E lines run east to Minnesota and south through Nebraska to connect with major transcontinental railroads [[Burlington Northern Santa Fe]] and [[Union Pacific]]. South Dakota does not have [[Amtrak]] service, one of the few states that doesn't.

Rapid City's central location allows easy transport of products to both coasts, and trucking is a major business activity in the city. Improved connections with Denver and I-80 to the south, via the [[Heartland Expressway]] now under construction will primarily benefit local trucking.

Rapid City's location on the boundary of the Western and Eastern power grids, together with the hydroelectric plants of the [[Mainstem Dams]] on the [[Missouri River]] and the large coal fields and power plants of the [[Powder River Basin]] of Wyoming make it one of the points where the two national power grids connect with each other, allowing switching of electrical power from east to west and vice versa.

==Infrastructure==
* [[Interstate 90]] is the primary east-west route for Rapid City.  Rapid City is served by a series of 7 exits.  I-90 skims the northern side of Rapid City.  The [[South Dakota Department of Transportation|South Dakota DOT]] has been reconstructing most of these interchanges in the last five years.
* [[Interstate 190 (South Dakota)|Interstate 190]] is an Interstate spur linking downtown Rapid City to [[Interstate 90]].
* [[U.S. Route 16|US Highway 16]] is the main route to the southwest and the [[Black Hills]] from Rapid City. It links Rapid City to [[Custer, South Dakota|Custer]] and then west to [[Newcastle, Wyoming]], where it connects to [[U.S. Route 85|US Highway 85]] for travel to Cheyenne and Denver.  Reconstructed as a four-lane parkway connecting Rapid City to Mount Rushmore in the mid-1960s, major segments have been rebuilt as three-lane or &quot;super-two&quot; highways in the past decade, to support increased tourist traffic.
* [[South Dakota Highway 44]] is a state highway that links the interior of the [[Black Hills]] to the southwest of Rapid City, and the [[Pine Ridge Indian Reservation]] and nearby areas in the Great Plains to the southeast.
* South Dakota Highway 79 is a state highway that is multiplexed with I-90 northwest of Rapid City.  SD Highway 79 extends to [[North Dakota]].  South of Rapid City to [[Nebraska]], Highway 79 is being reconstructed as the Heartland Expressway, a high-speed four-lane highway which will eventually connect to [[Interstate 80]] in Nebraska and the [[Colorado Front Range]] near [[Denver]].  The Heartland Expressway may eventually be extended along US Highway 85 north to [[Regina, Saskatchewan]], to create an additional major north-south artery through the [[Great Plains]] which would pass through Rapid City.

Rapid City's location on the boundary of the Western and Eastern power grids, together with the hydroelectric plants of the Mainstem Dams on the Missouri River and the large coal fields and power plants of the Powder River Basin of Wyoming make it one of the points where the two national power grids connect with each other, allowing switching of electrical power from east to west and vice versa.  Rapid City has its own coal-fired power plant, but also obtains much of its power from both the Missouri dams and power stations near [[Gillette, Wyoming]]. Electrical rates are considered relatively low.

Rapid City obtains most of its water supply from Rapid Creek and the alluvial aquifers associated with the creek, owning significant water rights in Pactola Reservoir located some {{convert|15|mi|km|0}} west of the city, but does also obtain water from some springs in the vicinity, and has the ability to draw water from deep formations which receive water from recharge in areas of the Black Hills where the formations come to the surface.  The heavy dependence on shallow alluvial aquifers is of some concern to planners, as most suburbs of Rapid City use septic systems for domestic sewage treatment.  However, water supplies remain relatively good for future growth.

The [[Rapid City Regional Airport]] operates at below maximum capacity for general aviation and commercial aviation, and is capable of handling all current commercial passenger and cargo aircraft.

Rapid City no longer has passenger rail service.  Rail cargo service is limited: the [[Dakota, Minnesota, and Eastern]] provides connections to other cities in South Dakota and Minnesota, and connects to major rail service along the Mississippi River corridor, but the DM&amp;E also connects to major transcontinental rail lines to the south, in Nebraska and Wyoming.

Rapid City has limited city-to-city bus service along I-90, but many charter bus services operate in the area, and connect Rapid City and Deadwood with cities in Colorado, Nebraska, and Iowa. Rapid City does have a municipally-owned bus service with multiple [[bus stops]] and a headquarters in the city.

==Town facts==
Mobridge was named for the town's railroad designation, a contracted form of Missouri &quot;Mo&quot; Bridge for the original railroad bridge over the [[Missouri River]].

==History==
{{Main|History of Sioux Falls, South Dakota}}
{{see also|Timeline of Sioux Falls history}}
[[File:Sioux Falls-waterfall.jpeg|thumb|left|Falls of the [[Big Sioux River]]]]
The history of Sioux Falls revolves around the cascades of the [[Big Sioux River]]. The falls were created about 14,000 years ago during the [[Wisconsin glaciation|last ice age]]. The lure of the falls has been a powerful influence. Ho-Chunk, Ioway, Otoe, Missouri, Omaha (and Ponca at the time), Quapaw, Kansa, Osage, Arikira, Dakota, Nakota and Cheyenne people inhabited the region previous to European descendants. Numerous [[burial mounds]] still exist on the high bluffs near the river.  The inhabitants maintained an agricultural society with fortified villages on many of the same sites that were previously settled. [[Lakota people|Lakota]] populate urban and reservation communities in the contemporary state and many Lakota, Dakota, Nakota, and other Indigenous Americans reside in Sioux Falls today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =American Indian Services Inc. | work = | publisher = | date = | url =http://www.americanindianservicesinc.org/ | accessdate =2008-04-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

French voyagers/explorers visited the area the early 18th century.  The first documented visit by an American (of European descent) was by [[Philander Prescott]], who camped overnight at the falls in December 1832. Captain [[James Allen (Army engineer)|James Allen]] led a military expedition out of Fort Des Moines in 1844. Jacob Ferris described the Falls in his 1856 book &quot;The States and Territories of the Great West&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = History of Sioux Falls | publisher = City of Sioux Falls | accessdate = 2008-11-23 | url = http://www.siouxfalls.org/Information/history/siouxfalls.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two separate groups, the Dakota Land Company of [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]] and the Western Town Company of [[Dubuque, Iowa|Dubuque]], [[Iowa]] organized in 1856 to claim the land around the falls, considering a promising townsite for its beauty and water power. Each laid out {{convert|320|acre|km2|sing=on}} claims, but worked together for mutual protection. They built a temporary barricade of turf which they dubbed &quot;Fort Sod,&quot; in response to hostilities threatened by native tribes. Seventeen men then spent &quot;the first winter&quot; in Sioux Falls. The following year the population grew to near 40.

Although conflicts in [[Minnehaha County]] between [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] and white [[settlers]] were few, the [[Dakota War of 1862]] engulfed nearby southwestern [[Minnesota]]. The town was evacuated in August of that year when two local [[settlers]] were killed as a result of the conflict. The [[settlers]] and [[soldiers]] stationed here traveled to [[Yankton, South Dakota|Yankton]] in late August 1862. The abandoned townsite was pillaged and burned.

Fort Dakota, a military reservation established in present day downtown, was established in May 1865.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angelfire.com/mn3/rambow/vtour.html Angelfire.com], Retrieved on 2008-06-21&lt;/ref&gt; Many former settlers gradually returned and a new wave of settlers arrived in the following years. The population grew to 593 by 1873, and a building boom was underway in that year.The Village of Sioux Falls, consisting of {{convert|1200|acre|km2}}, was incorporated in 1876 and was granted a city charter by the Dakota Territorial legislature on March 3, 1883.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.factmonster.com/ce6/us/A0845380.html Sioux falls – FactMonster.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The arrival of the [[Rail transport|railroads]] ushered in the great Dakota Boom decade of the 1880s. The population of Sioux Falls mushroomed from 2,164 in 1880 to 10,167 at the close of the decade. The growth transformed the city. A severe plague of grasshoppers and a national depression halted the boom by the early 1890s. The city grew by only 89 people from 1890 to 1900.

But prosperity eventually returned with the opening of the John Morrell meat packing plant in 1909, the establishment of an airbase and a military radio and communications training school in 1942, and the completion of the interstate highways in the early 1960s. Much of the growth in the first part of the 20th century was fueled by  agriculturally based industry, such as the Morrell plant and the nearby stockyards (one of the largest in the nation).

{{Wide image|Sioux Falls panorama 1908 1.jpg|650px|Downtown Sioux Falls in 1908, looking west.}}

In 1955 the city decided to consolidate the neighboring incorporated city of [[South Sioux Falls, South Dakota|South Sioux Falls]].  At the time South Sioux Falls had a population of nearly 1,600 inhabitants, according to the 1950 census.  It was third largest city in the county after Sioux Falls and Dell Rapids.  By October 18, 1955 South Sioux Falls residents voted 704 in favor and 227 against to consolidate with Sioux Falls.  On the same issue, Sioux Falls residents voted on November 15 by the vote 2,714 in favor and 450 against.

In 1981, to take advantage of recently relaxed state [[usury]] laws, [[Citibank]] relocated its primary credit card center from [[New York]] to Sioux Falls. Some claim that this event was the primary impetus for the increased population and job growth rates that Sioux Falls has experienced over the past quarter century. Others point out that Citibank's relocation was only part of a more general transformation of the city's economy from an industrially based one to an economy centered on health care, finance and retail trade.&lt;ref&gt;Hetland, Cara. ''Sioux Falls 25 years after Citibank's arrival.'' [http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2006/02/23/siouxfalls], Minnesota Public Radio. 24 February 2006. (accessed 23 March 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Sioux Falls has grown at a rapid pace since the late 1970s, with the city's population increasing from 81,000 in 1980 to 153,888 in 2010.&lt;ref name=2010census/&gt;

===Parks and recreation===
[[File:Sioux Falls Outdoor Campus.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The South Dakota Department of Game, Fish, and Parks' Outdoor Campus.]]Sioux Falls maintains a network of more than 70 parks and greenways that are spread throughout the city. Probably the best known of these is Falls Park, established around the city's namesake waterfalls on the Big Sioux River, just north of downtown. Other notable parks include Terrace Park ([http://www.siouxfalls.org/Information/history/park_history/terrace.aspx Terrace Park History]), McKennan Park, Sherman Park, and Yankton Trail park. A popular feature of the park system is a paved {{convert|16|mi|km|sing=on}} path used for biking, jogging, and walking. The path follows the course of the Big Sioux River, forming a loop around central Sioux Falls, with a few spurs off the main bike trail. The South Dakota Department of Game, Fish, and Parks has an Outdoor Campus in Sioux Falls where it has several outdoor areas devoted to wildlife. The Outdoor Campus hosts many outdoor activities through the year as well; these activities include such things as [[amateur astronomy|star gazing]] and [[snowshoe]]ing. During the winter, [[Great Bear Recreation Park]] offers skiing, snow boarding, and tubing.

===Climate===
Due to its inland location, Sioux Falls experiences a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Dfa''), which is characterized by hot, relatively humid summers and cold, dry winters, and is located in [[Hardiness zone|USDA Plant Hardiness Zone]] 4b.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map|accessdate = 2013-07-18|url = http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/Default.aspx|publisher = United States Department of Agriculture - Agricultural Research Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; The monthly daily average temperature ranges from {{convert|16.6|°F|1}} in January to {{convert|73.0|°F|1}} in July, while there are 18 days of {{convert|90|°F|0}}+ highs and 26 days with sub-{{convert|0|°F|0}} lows annually. Snowfall occurs mostly in light to moderate amounts during the winter, totaling {{convert|44.6|in|cm|0}}. Precipitation, at {{convert|26.3|in|mm|0}} annually, is concentrated in the warmer months. Extremes range from {{convert|-42|°F|0}} on [[Great Blizzard of 1899|February 9, 1899]] to {{convert|110|°F|0}} as recently as June 21, 1988.&lt;ref name = TWC /&gt;

* '''City government:''' The city of Sioux Falls is led by a [[mayor-council]] (strong mayor) form of government. Mayoral elections occur every four years. City council seats are also contested every four years. However, not all of the council members are elected in the same year, as the council elections are staggered throughout even-numbered years. The council consists of five members elected to represent specific sections of the city and three additional seats that represent the city as a whole (that is, [[at-large]]). The council member position is designed to be part-time. Sioux Falls operates under a [[home rule]] charter as permitted by the South Dakota constitution.&lt;ref name=SiouxFallscouncil&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.siouxfalls.org/upload/documents/comdev/2006%20plan%20draft%20comment.pdf |format=PDF| title = 2006 Action Plan Draft| format = [[comma-separated values|CSV]] | publisher = City of Sioux Falls | year = 2006 | accessdate = 2007-03-20 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070704194931/http://www.siouxfalls.org/upload/documents/comdev/2006+plan+draft+comment.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally centered on quarrying and agriculturally-based industries, the economy of Sioux Falls has become greatly diversified and more service-based over the last half-century, making the city an important location for [[financial services]], [[health care]], and [[retail]] trade.

===Industry===
Partially due to the lack of a state corporate income tax, Sioux Falls is the home of a number of financial companies. The largest employers among these, and fourth and fifth largest employers overall,&lt;ref name=&quot;siouxfallsdevelopment&quot; /&gt; are [[Wells Fargo]] and [[Citigroup]]. Other important financial service companies located in Sioux Falls include [[Great Western Bank (Midwest)|Great Western Bank]], [[Western Surety Company]] (CNA Surety), Total Card Inc., Capital Card Services, Midland National Life Insurance Company, [[Capital One]], and [[First Premier Bank]].

Sioux Falls is a significant regional health care center. There are four major hospitals in Sioux Falls: [[Sanford Health-MeritCare|Sanford Health]] (formerly Sioux Valley), [[Avera Health|Avera]] [http://www.averamckennan.org/amck/index.aspx McKennan Hospital], the South Dakota [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Affairs]] Hospital, and the [http://www.southdakotaheart.com/ Avera Heart Hospital of South Dakota].  Sanford Health and Avera Health are the largest and second largest employers in the city, respectively. [[Emergency medical services]] (EMS) are provided by both the Sioux Falls Rural/Metro Ambulance Service and the Sioux Falls Fire Rescue.

Companies based in Sioux Falls include Raven Industries, retailers [[Lewis Drug]] and Sunshine Foods, as well as communications companies [[LodgeNet]] and [[Midcontinent Communications]].

[[File:morrells1.jpg|thumb|left|The John Morrell plant has always been a major employer in Sioux Falls, although the city's economy has become more diversified in recent decades.]]

Because of the relatively long distances between Sioux Falls and larger cities, Sioux Falls has emerged as an important regional center of shopping and dining. The [[Empire Mall]], with over 180 stores, anchors one of the primary retail zones in the southwest section of the city. This area, centered mainly around the intersection of 41st Street and Louise Avenue, contains many large national chain stores and restaurants.

In Central Downtown, shops line Phillips Avenue, and in the &quot;EastBank&quot; shops and restaurants fill a boardwalk style center called &quot;8th and Railroad.&quot; &quot;The Bridges&quot; is an outdoor shopping center located at the intersection of 57th Street and Western Avenue on the south side of the city. The Bridges contains over 30 restaurants, boutiques, and private businesses. Dawley Farm Village is a major commercial development located on the east side of the city at the intersection of [[South Dakota Highway 42|SD Highway 42]] and Powder House Road ([[South Dakota Highway 11|SD Highway 11]]).

While no longer as economically dominant as it once was, the [[manufacturing]] and [[food processing]] sector remains an important component of the economy of Sioux Falls. The [[Smithfield Foods|John Morrell]] meat packing plant is the third largest employer in the city. Other important manufacturing companies include Wheeler Tank Mfg, Maguire Iron, Amesbury Group, Teem, [[Raven Industries]], Bell Incorporated, [[Tyco International|Tyco]], Gage Brothers, and Rosenbauer America.

The [http://eros.usgs.gov/#/About_Us/Background USGS Earth Resources Observation and Science Center] is located approximately 10 miles north of Sioux Falls. It currently houses one of the largest computer complexes in the Department of the Interior. EROS has approximately 600 government and contractor employees.

Downtown Sioux Falls plays host to a SculptureWalk&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sculpturewalksiouxfalls.com/ |title=SculptureWalk Sioux Falls homepage |author=Jim Clark |accessdate=25 Nov 09}}&lt;/ref&gt; every summer. The exhibits change yearly and most often reflect historical significance and progressive standards for the city.

In the past decade, Sioux Falls experienced a renaissance of cultural interest. With a plethora of white collar jobs in the area, Sioux Falls' leaders saw a need for more arts and culture in the region.

The Sioux Empire Arts Council continues to be an initiating leader in the arts scene of the Sioux Falls area and give out Mayor's Awards each year in several categories for excellence demonstrated by Sioux Falls residents within the particular form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =Mayor's Awards for the Arts | work = | publisher =Sioux Empire Arts Council | date = | url =http://www.siouxempireartscouncil.com/Mayor.htm | accessdate =2008-04-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poetry and literary events began to come to greater popularity with the opening of the Sioux Empire Arts Council Horse Barn Gallery and due to a National Endowment for the Arts-supported Writer's Voice. The Writer's Voice included a reading series of 38 nationally known poets and writers (per year) who performed works and youth workshops through the Sioux Falls Writers Voice in local performance spaces, at the YMCA afterschool program, and in local area schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ymca.net/arts_and_humanities/national_writers_voice.html |title=YMCA National Writer's Voice |author=YMCA of the USA |accessdate=25 Nov 09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this renaissance [[Allison Hedge Coke]] moved to Sioux Falls from [[Rapid City, South Dakota|Rapid City]] as she was serving the state of South Dakota, first as a part-time literary artist in the Sioux Falls Schools and then as a full-time literary artist in residence for the Sioux Falls school district. Later she held the literary artist role with the school district while simultaneously teaching at Kilian College and the University of Sioux Falls. She continually participated at-large in the national literary field as a visiting writer/performing artist. [[Tom Foster]] moved to Sioux Falls (from California), having already developed a presence in the California Slam scene and was integral to keeping public open-mics going strong. Charles Luden continued to make poetry a typical presence throughout the art scene as he had advocated for decades by this time. Deb Klebanoff began to create more high-profile city spaces for poetry and literary events to be secured through the city and area government. Hedge Coke continued to initiate and implement new literary programming while advocating for youth involvement and neighborhood issues in Sioux Falls Arts &amp; Cultural life. The Washington Pavilion continued to donate space for literary activities as well as the Siouxland Sioux Falls Library. Eventually, [[David Allan Evans]] returned to Sioux Falls as the current State of South Dakota Poet Laureate and enhanced the literary scene with his reintroduction to the Sioux Falls community and presence as the state poet. Rosie Blunk, long-time theater teacher from Sioux Falls, retired from teaching and began hosting the Poetry Out Loud! state competitions as well.

'''Deadwood''' is a city in [[South Dakota]], United States, and the [[county seat]] of [[Lawrence County, South Dakota|Lawrence County]]. It is named for the [[Coarse woody debris|dead trees]] found in its [[gulch]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deadwood.org/AboutDeadwood/History/?utm_source=Black%2BHills%2BTravel%2BBlog&amp;utm_medium=Blog&amp;utm_term=Deadwood&amp;utm_content=October%2B20&amp;utm_campaign=Black%2BHills%2BDigital%2BStrategies%2BGroup Deadwood Chamber of Commerce]&lt;/ref&gt; The population was 1,270 according to the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. The city includes the [[Deadwood Historic District]], a [[National Historic Landmark District]], whose borders may be the city limits.

==History==

===19th century===
The illegal settlement of Deadwood began in the 1870s on the territory granted to [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indians]] in the 1868 [[Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868)|Treaty of Laramie]]. The treaty had guaranteed ownership of the [[Black Hills]] to the [[Lakota people]], and disputes over the Hills were ongoing, having reached the [[United States Supreme Court]] on several occasions. However, in 1874, Colonel [[George Armstrong Custer]] led an expedition into the  Hills and announced the discovery of gold on French Creek near present-day [[Custer, South Dakota|Custer]], South Dakota. Custer's announcement triggered the [[Black Hills Gold Rush]] and gave rise to the lawless town of Deadwood, which quickly reached a population of around 5,000.

In early 1876, frontiersman [[Charlie Utter]] and his brother Steve led a [[wagon train]] to Deadwood containing what were deemed to be needed commodities to bolster business. The wagon train brought [[gamblers]] and prostitutes, resulting in the establishment of profitable ventures.  Demand for women was high, and the business of prostitution proved to have a good market. Madam [[Dora DuFran]] would eventually become the most profitable [[brothel]] owner in Deadwood, closely followed by Madam [[Mollie Johnson]]. Businessman Tom Miller opened the [[Bella Union Saloon]] in September of that year.
[[Image:Cyark Deadwood Bullock Clark.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Photo-textured [[3D scanner|3D laser scan]] image of Bullock-Clark Building, 616–618 Main Street (1894)]]

Another saloon was the [[Gem Theater|Gem Variety Theater]], opened April 7, 1877 by [[Al Swearengen]] who also controlled the opium trade in the town. The saloon was destroyed by a fire and rebuilt in 1879. It burned down again in 1899, causing Swearengen to leave the town.

The town attained notoriety for the murder of [[Wild Bill Hickok]], and [[Mount Moriah Cemetery (South Dakota)|Mount Moriah Cemetery]] remains the final resting place of Hickok and [[Calamity Jane]], as well as slightly less notable figures such as [[Seth Bullock]]. Deadwood became known for its wild and almost lawless reputation, during which time murder was common, and punishment for murders not always fair and impartial.  Hickok's murderer, [[Jack McCall]], was prosecuted twice, despite the U.S. Constitution's prohibition against [[double jeopardy]], because of a ruling that Deadwood was an illegal town in Indian Territory and thus lacked the jurisdiction to prosecute or acquit McCall.  This decision moved McCall's trial to a Dakota Territory court (&quot;Indian Court&quot;), where he was found guilty of murder and hanged.

As the economy changed from gold rush to steady mining, Deadwood lost its rough and rowdy character and settled down into a prosperous town. In 1876, a [[smallpox]] epidemic swept through the camp with so many falling ill that tents were erected to [[quarantine]] the stricken. On December 13, 1959, the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]/[[Warner Brothers]] western [[television series]] ''[[Colt .45 (TV series)|Colt .45]]'' aired the episode &quot;Calamity&quot;, a dramatization of the event. Dody Heath was cast as Calamity Jane and [[Joan Taylor]] as a woman doctor, Ellen McGraw. In the story line, series character Christopher Colt, played by [[Wayde Preston]], hires Calamity Jane to drive the stagecoach containing Dr. McGraw and the vaccine needed to fight the epidemic. Colt is at first unsure if Calamity can handle the job because miners and [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]] seek to steal the valuable medication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ctva.biz/US/Western/Colt45.htm|title=''Colt .45''|publisher=ctva.biz|accessdate=December 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1876, [[George Crook|General George Crook]] pursued the [[Sioux Indians]] from the [[Battle of Little Big Horn]] on an expedition that ended in Deadwood and is known as the [[Horsemeat March]]. The [[Homestake Mine (South Dakota)|Homestake Mine]] in nearby [[Lead, South Dakota|Lead]] was established in 1877. For years, it was the longest continuously operating gold mine in the United States. Gold mining operations ceased in 2002, but the mine continues to be open to tourists.

On September 26, 1879, a fire devastated Deadwood, destroying more than three hundred buildings, and consuming the belongings of many inhabitants. Many of the newly impoverished left town to start again elsewhere without the opportunities of rich untapped veins of ore that characterized the early days of Deadwood.

A [[narrow-gauge railways|narrow-gauge railroad]], the [[Deadwood Central Railroad]], was founded by Deadwood resident J.K.P. Miller and his associates in 1888, in order to serve their mining interests in the Black Hills.  The railroad was purchased by the [[Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad]] in 1893.  A portion of the railroad between Deadwood and [[Lead, South Dakota|Lead]] was [[railway electrification|electrified]] in 1902 for operation as an [[interurban]] passenger system, which operated until 1924.  The railroad was abandoned in 1930, apart from a portion from [[Kirk, South Dakota|Kirk]] to [[Fantail Junction, South Dakota|Fantail Junction]], which was converted to [[standard gauge]].  The remaining section was abandoned by the successor [[Burlington Northern Railroad]] in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{Hilton Narrow Gauge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the other early town residents and frequent visitors included [[Al Swearengen]], [[E. B. Farnum]], [[Charlie Utter]], [[Sol Star]], [[Martha Bullock]], [[A. W. Merrick]], [[Samuel Fields]], [[Calamity Jane]], [[Dr. Valentine McGillycuddy]], the [[Reverend]] [[Henry Weston Smith]], and [[Wild Bill Hickok]].

===20th and 21st centuries===
Another major fire in September 1959 came close to destroying the town. About {{convert|4500|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}} were burned and an evacuation order was issued. Nearly 3,600 volunteer and professional [[firefighter]]s, including personnel from the [[Homestake Mine (South Dakota)|Homestake Mine]] and [[Ellsworth Air Force Base]], worked to contain the fire, which resulted in a major regional economic downturn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Historic Wildfire in the Black Hills – Deadwood 1959|url=http://www.nfpa.org/assets/files/pdf/blackhills.pdf|publisher=[[National Fire Protection Association]]|accessdate=July 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The entire town was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1961. However, the town underwent additional decline and financial stresses during the next two decades.&lt;ref name=rcj/&gt; [[Interstate 90]] bypassed it in 1964 and its brothels were shut down after a 1980 raid.&lt;ref name=rcj/&gt; A fire in December 1987 destroyed the historic Syndicate Building and a neighboring structure.&lt;ref name=rcj/&gt; The fire spurred the &quot;Deadwood Experiment&quot;, in which gambling was tested as a means of revitalizing a city center.&lt;ref name=rcj/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey Perret|Perret, Geoffrey]]. &quot;[http://americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2005/2/2005_2_54.shtml &quot;The Town That Took a Chance]&quot; ''American Heritage'', April/May 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, gambling was legal only in the state of [[Nevada]] and in [[Atlantic City]].&lt;ref name=usda&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/rdp/rdp296/rdp296c.pdf|title=Deadwood, South Dakota – Gambling, Historic Preservation, and Economic Revitalization|publisher=[[USDA]]|accessdate=November 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deadwood was the first small community in the U.S. to seek legal gambling revenues as a way of maintaining local historic qualities.&lt;ref name=usda/&gt; Gambling was legalized in Deadwood in 1989 and immediately brought significant new revenues and development.&lt;ref name=nhl/&gt; The pressure of development may have an effect on the historical integrity of the landmark district.&lt;ref name=nhl&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=538&amp;ResourceType=District|title=National Historic Landmarks Program: Deadwood Historic District|publisher=[[National Park Service]]|accessdate=January 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chinatown===

The gold rush attracted Chinese immigrants to the area. Their population peaked at 250.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chinese|publisher=City of Deadwood|url=http://deadwood.govoffice.com/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&amp;SEC=%7BCDB0704A-757E-47EE-8ADB-7345C637CE19%7D|accessdate=November 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few engaged in mining; most worked in service enterprises. A quarter arose on Main Street, encouraged by the lack of restrictions on foreign property ownership in Dakota Territory and a relatively high level of tolerance.  Wong Fee Lee arrived in Deadwood in 1876 and became a leading merchant. He was a community leader among the Chinese Americans until his death in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;Edith C. Wong et al., &quot;Deadwood's Pioneer Merchant,&quot; South Dakota History (2009) 39#4 pp 283-335&lt;/ref&gt;

The quarter's residents also included African-Americans and Americans of European extraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=rtRFyFO4hpEC&amp;pg=PA165&amp;dq=Chinatown+deadwood#v=onepage&amp;q=Chinatown&amp;f=false|pages=140, 141|title=Encyclopedia of the Great Plains|author=David J.

==Geography==
Deadwood is located at {{coord|44|22|36|N|103|43|45|W|}}.{{GR|1}}

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|3.83|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, all of it land.&lt;ref name =&quot;Gazetteer files&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deadwood has been assigned the [[ZIP code]] 57732 and the [[FIPS place code]] 15700.

===Recreation===
In the summer, there are numerous trails for hiking, mountain biking, and horse back riding. The northern end of the [[George S. Mickelson Trail]] starts in Deadwood and runs south through the Black Hills to Edgemont. Several man made lakes, including [[Sheridan Lake]], provide fishing and swimming. [[Spearfish Canyon]] to the north has many places to rock climb. In early June the Mickelson Trail Marathon and 5K, as well as accompanying races for children, are held.

During the winter there are two ski areas just a few miles outside of nearby [[Lead, South Dakota|Lead]], SD – [[Terry Peak]] and [[Deer Mountain]].

&quot;The Midnight Star&quot; casino in Deadwood is owned by American film actor [[Kevin Costner]]. International versions of many of his films' posters line its walls.

=== Climate ===
Deadwood's climate varies considerably from the rest of the state and surrounding areas. While most of the state receives less than 15 inches of precipitation per year, annual precipitation amounts in the Lead-Deadwood area reach nearly 30 inches. Most of these 30 inches fall in the winter as snow, although snow can occur as early as September and last until late May. Spring is brief and is characterized by large wet snow storms and periods of rain.
